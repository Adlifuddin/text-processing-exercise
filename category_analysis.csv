1,"Comcast Internet high-speed is not high-speed at all.  It is slow and getting slower. I am paying for high-speed Internet, and not getting this service."
1,"I couldn't get online in the internet although my internet phone worked. My internet phone is Vonage, not Comcast. When I called Comcast, Beatrice told me I would have to pay $39.99 for wireless help. This never happened before. It's a revenue drive, in my opinion."
1,"I am unable to access the internet on one of my computers although it shows that I am connected to the network.  I called comcast and they told me they could help me if I purchased a tech team internet service for 40 bucks.  I did and they transferred me to get help.  I have now been on hold for now exaggeration. One hour and 22 minutes and still waiting. I am filling this out on the computer that still works, so far.  I wonder if they are hacking into my system and knocking it out as a way to get me to sign up for this new service. Help!"
1,"I disconnected Comcast May 2nd 2011.  I was told by a Comcast rep to return the equipments to the nearest Comcast office within the week.  So that was exactly what I did on May 3rd & got a receipt of returned equipments.  The receipt also showed the account had 2 cents credit.  I even verified with the rep at that office that I didn't owe anything.   Then later on, I received phone calls from Comcast asking for their equipments. I told them that I have proof that their equipments were returned.  They basically said not to worry.  Then I received a bill in early June charging me for unreturned equipments.  I called & spoke to yet another Comcast rep.  I was so upset.  The lady looked up my account & I was on hold a long time while she researched.  She came back at the end & told me not to worry b/c the system showed that I don't owe anything.  I asked for a confirmation email, but she said there wasn't a way for her to do that.  Then today July 7th, I got another bill same as in June!  I call Comcast again. I asked for a supervisor.  After being on hold 15 minutes the rep came back on to tell me he can't find a supervisor.  Then he connected me to Nadia.  Again I explained my situation.  She said I still owe Comcast for the modem.  I explained that I  didn't have modem owned by Comcast;  I had an old modem that was offered for free six years ago via Comcast promotion w/ Bestbuy.  When that modem died, I purchased another modem.  All with my own money.  At first rep Nadia didn't want to hear, but eventually listened.  So finally she said she would have the matter researched & removed the charge for now.  Comcast have lost me for life, & I will spread the word. "
1,"I am being charged for services when my services would be interrupted by them repairing services, indispute with Fox network, when service is failure to dig up cable line,weather condition cause cable interruption, this is the reason I switch my telephone and internet due to these poor working conditons, thenb I notified the company I would be switiching to another provider due to the poor services."
1,"Billing jumped in 1 month from $96 to $136 to $145 and now we are being told $150.  Explanation totally unclear, and the billing is so confusing even a CPA couldn't figure it out.  Credits, debits, 30 days, 34 days, package, etc. and the service stinks.  Hardly a day without some interruption."
1,"Comcast arbitrarily changed the schedules twice without any prior notice or consultation.  They pretended that the rescheduling never happened and that I confused the dates.On June 21, I did a live chat with a Comcast assistant and disconnection of the Internet service was scheduled for June 28.  However, no one showed up on June 28!  After waiting for Comcast's technicians the whole day, I called Comcast and was told that my appointment was ORIGINALLY scheduled for July 2, not June 28.  They should be ashamed of themselves for telling such a lie. Had I been told that all of the Comcast technicians would be so busy during the high season for moving and could not help rescheduling my appointment, I would have understood the situation. However, they lied to me about the appointment. I still keep the record of the live chat stating that the appointment was originally planned for June 28, not July 2.  I think that after Comcast rescheduled my appointments, the company removed the record of the original schedule to pretend that the rescheduling never happened.Anyway, on July 2, I waited for Comcast's technicians the whole day again, but no one showed up again! When I called Comcast, I heard that this time, my appointment was ORIGINALLY scheduled for July 20!  Do I have to pay one more month because of the company's reschedule and lie?  I am moving out next week!  They messed up my moving schedule!  I was so upset so the assistant let me talk to his supervisor, who advanced the appointment from July 20 to July 5. This time, I hope to meet real human beings sent by Comcast."
1,"Comcast called and offered to upgrade our existing internet at no extra cost. When the technician arrived, we were told that we were required to purchase Cable TV to obtain the upgrade or else the cost would be raised from $59.95 to $69.95. We refused, and the new Internet was installed, under protest, but we soon discovered it did not work. We phoned Comcast and pursued the problem for 6 hours until a new appointment was scheduled. The next technician arrived late and did not know how to fix the problem. He called another technician who removed the new equipment and attempted to install the older model. He ran out of time and so another appointment was scheduled. Comcast failed to keep that appointment. The internet still does not work and we are again calling Comcast to no avail. "
1,"In April of this year, we saw a Comcast ad on television for Internet 2Go for $19.99 a month for six months. So I went online to order it. I was told that we would have to pay $40 a month, that the $19.99 deal wasn't available to us, I reluctantly agreed, stating as long as it was only $40 a month, the service rep said it would be, and proceeded setting it up. There was no mention of any roaming charges that came with the deal. My bill, before I ordered this service, was around $145 a month for cable, internet and the un-returned equipment charges they have been doing for over 5 years. When the May bill arrived, it was $260 plus a $60 roaming charge. I payed it. My June bill is $334, $110 roaming charge. I terminated the service, today June 24.I have been paying the different amounts of the un-returned equipment charges for over five years if not longer. My wife is on SSI, and can't afford to pay these high prices for basic cable, digital converter and remote and internet."
1,"Comcast's Internet services has the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.  It all started 3 weeks ago when a contractor doing work at my neighbor's house (where the Comcast utility box is located) cut the DSL line which goes from the Comcast box to my house.  Since then, I have spoken to Comcast's customer service department over 15 times.  They have sent out 7 different technicians and I still have the same problem.  Their cable line has not been buried and has run over my fence and through my deck. The latest situation happened earlier this week.  We had an appointment for a ""line crew"" to come out and bury the line on Tuesday, 6/21.  O crew showed up on Monday, took a look at the problem and said that they would return on Tuesday, 6/21, to do the actual work.  I called Comcast on 6/21 at noon, 5:30pm and 8:00pm as nobody from Comcast showed up or called.I was told on all 3 calls that I had an open ticket and that a tech would be at my home by 9pm.  When nobody showed up, I called Comcast again at 9:30pm and was told my appointment was rescheduled for Wednesday, 6/22.  My wife took another day off from work on Wednesday.  We called Comcast at 12:30pm, 5:15pm and 7:30pm and we were told that a tech would be arriving by 9pm.  I called back at 9:30pm when nobody from Comcast showed up and was told that the tech called my cell phone at 7:00pm to reschedule for today, 6/23.Of course, this was totally false, a lie.  When I pointed out that I called after 7:00pm, was told I had an ""open ticket,"" and that a tech would be out by 9pm, the customer service rep apologized and did not have any further information for me except that they would be out today between 9am-9pm.  He also said his ""supervisor"" would call me (last night) with an explanation.  Of course, nobody called last night. Today, I spoke with a supervisor of the department, which is supposed to come out to my house for the job.  He had no explanation and said that it appears the job has been rescheduled for tomorrow, 6/24.  When I complained ""loud enough,"" he said he would have someone come out today.  They are supposed to call me prior to coming; however, I won't hold my breath.  Unfortunately, I don't have any other DSL options where I live or I would have switched providers a long time ago.  If you are considering ordering Comcast Internet services, do yourself a favor and don't do it!  They are horrible."
1,"Comcast is upgrading their network to provide consumers a better experience. This upgrade will cost consumers an additional $7/month. While I am not sure of the details of the upgrade, I suspect that the upgrade will benefit Comcast by enabling compression or other bandwidth savings, or provide better management or some other angle that directly benefits Comcast. This is the second 'upgrade' they performed that wound up costing consumers more. The first one was when they changed the signaling inside consumer’s homes. Before they did that, I was able to receive HDTV signals on any of my sets, and I didn't need a set-top box. After the upgrade, a set-top box is required (at a monthly cost). Which branch of government is responsible for allowing these large monopolies to continue to raise prices like this?"
1,"I had a business account with Comcast. I sold my business on March 28th and I called Comcast and terminated the service in January. I started receiving phone calls from Comcast in April that there is a balance owed on the account. The first call I received was the end of April. When the representative told me there was a balance owed, I got ready to give him my credit card info for the payment. In the middle of the transaction, he mentioned that he apologizes for the call and there is no payment owed on the account. He looked through the records and saw it in the notes that the balance to date has been paid. I was glad that they figured it out and end of conversation. I received another call the very next day from another representative and he said the same thing that there was a balance owed on the account. I told him at the time that I spoke with someone the day before and at the end of our conversation I was told that there isn't any balance owed. I asked the second representative to read through the notes before we go any further. At the end he told me the same thing. He apologized for the phone call and said there was no balance owed. I offered to do a payment anyway and if there is a reimbursement, I'd rather wait for that rather than get something reported on my credit report. The representative assured me that won't happen and clearly everything is documented on my account history. I also told him that I didn't appreciate the phone calls and he said I will receive one more phone call because of the automatic system they have and I could just ignore the call. I didn't receive any call after that. On May 31st, I received a message on my phone that I have a charge on my credit through a collection agency. I called the collection agency right away to find out what the charge was. It was a charge off from Comcast for the same issue. I know the collection agency could only take the payment and I had to resolve this matter with Comcast, so I gave my credit card information to ER Solutions and paid the settlement. The representative asked me to call 14 days later to receive a debt release letter. Today, June 1st, I called Comcast to talk to someone about the misinformation I was given. I was on the phone for 40 minutes and spoke with 2 representatives. The first representative (Stan) told me that even if I cancel my contract, it takes 60 days before the cancellation; so I still owe for the months I didn't have service. I told him that that was not the issue; the issue is the misinformation I was given and the fact that this will be reported to my credit. Stan transferred my call to another department and I then spoke with Larry. Larry told me that I have to talk to the collection agency regarding this matter. I insisted on speaking with the manager. The manager related the message through Larry that they clearly see there was an error. The business contract with Comcast was supposed to be terminated January 19th but the clerk entered the wrong date of April 18th. Therefore, they kept billing me and all the charges accrued on this closed account. At the end of our conversation Larry told me that this will be taken care of by the end of business date tomorrow and now I have to wait 30 days for a refund from the charge I paid to the collection agency.I work full time and I pay my bills on time. I work very hard to maintain good standing on my credit. I sold my business in March and I'm still dealing with Comcast on an account that was supposed to be closed in January when it's June now. They told me that this would not be reflected on my credit but because they have consistently misinformed me, I don't trust what they tell me anymore. They have harassed me with phone calls and had me on the phone repeating myself over and over explaining what had happened. Clearly Comcast does not care for their customers. The result out of this whole situation is that they made a bad reflection on my credit rating. I would ask Consumer Affairs to look into Comcast’s complaint ratings and how efficient they are processing they're customers requests. They clearly need training to process the transactions efficiently and accurately. I spoke with over five representatives and they all assured to correct their mistakes but they haven't so far. I will be contacting them again to make sure they resolve this issue."
1,"Last summer I installed a Comcast internet and television system at my home. The first technician came out and strung wire and put in a modem box with a splitter for the TV. The system worked for about a week and then we started losing the signal. I called them back and the tech said we needed a power booster, so we did that, it worked for a while then trouble again and another technician ran new wires from pole to house, said I didn't need the power booster and fixed it for a while then same issue no service. Comcast has a communications system that's partially automated that will dump you if your number appears to have issues assigned to it or one minute you will be chatting with someone in Knoxville and the next in Mississippi they call it "" call sharing "" I call it caller dumping. I have spent more than 40 hours chatting with all kinds of customer service people and have been told conflicting information by all of them.Later in the year they brought me a new modem but failed to register it as I was talking with joy in Nashville she said the modem was not on file so we added it. Two days later I chatted with Melissa in Nashville and she said it was not on file so we put it on again. I wanted to speak to a supervisor on Thursday May 19th and I chatted with Ryan in Knoxville, he promised that a technical supervisor from Memphis would call me and I’m still waiting.On Monday May 23 after a good chat with Carla in Memphis she sent out a technician and the Germantown Collierville technical supervisor Carolyn ** who did a fine job trying to fix my issue. She even followed up the next day to try and fix the issue. The afternoon after she and the tech left I could not log on so the new box the 3rd one in a year would not let me on I talked with tech support which is in the Philippines three different times and finally got back on Tuesday May 24th.On Tuesday evening finally totally fed up with Comcast I ordered an ATT DSL internet system and it arrived the next day and I hooked it up and it has not faltered at all. On 5-26-11, I contacted the corporate office in Pennsylvania and chatted with a staffer who said someone from the local office would be calling me and that hasn't happened either. I have heard every false bit of misinformation one can hear from Comcast."
1,"I subscribe to Comcast cable internet. I do not want to receive emails promoting their programing or packages. For the last year I have tried to get them to stop sending the unwanted emails. I call, email and opt out usually every other month when the emails start. My last complaint, they suggested that I set up an email filter to block their unwanted email. I was even given instructions.In the past, I told them I no longer wish to use their email, and asked them to lower my internet bill. They thought I was joking. My history with Comcast is not good. When I moved, it took almost 10 hrs on the phone to get my service right. They tried to charge me for my modem, they claimed it was theirs. I tried the digital cable. I had to take the digital box back because I was sent letters threatening to raise my rates if I didn't sign a paper that I assumed I'II had already signed when I got the box."
1,"My Internet stopped working.  My husband called customer ""no"" service to get some help, but the guy couldn't help.  So, my husband requested a tech come out to our house to take a look at it.  After much arguing, the tech finally scheduled the appointment for 5/3/11 between 8-10 am.  My husband requested the day off and we received automated calls and emails reminding us of the appointment.  We confirmed with the automated phone call that we did want to keep our scheduled appointment.  On 5/3/11, at 7:59 am, my cell phone rings.  My husband went outside to see if the tech was out front to let him know we were home, but no one was there.  I check my voicemail, it says, ""This is Comcast calling regarding your appointment, call to reschedule.""  What?I called right back and was on the phone with a rep.  I was told that I had to reschedule since I didn't pick up the phone.  It was 8:06 am.  Really?  Wow!  We were livid!  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold for 10 minutes.  And then the same rep came back on the phone.  She never got a supervisor and just repeated what she had said prior.  I asked to be transferred to a supervisor again and she blind transferred the call to another rep, not a supervisor.  I had to repeat everything I had already discussed with the previous rep.  So, after much arguing, I was finally transferred to a supervisor (it was after 9 am by this point, one hour into the phone call) who stated that my appointment wasn't cancelled and they would still be there by 10 am.  10:30 am hits, still no call, and no tech at my house.I called again and spoke with Surel who stated that the appointment had been cancelled.  What?  I was done!  I asked him to cancel my service.  I don't pay over $70 a month for Internet service just to be treated like this.  So he put me through to Bobby.  Bobby was very apologetic and friendly and even understanding.  He offered me an appointment for the same day from 2-4 pm and a $20 credit and $15 off my bill for the next 12 months.  I told him that was fine, but I was going to talk to my husband about still cancelling, and he understood.Well, so far, it is 3:58 pm and no call.  I guess we got cancelled again without us knowing.  My phone hasn't rang once, so they have two minutes to give me a call or they are going to get dropped.  I can pay $70 to someone who needs it and will value me as a customer.  Poor customer service.  Do not use them, they are awful!"
1,"My dad and I live together and have been subscribing to Comcast for roughly 2 years now. Originally, our service was just fine. No problems. Now, it is the exact opposite. I believe it started in January when the internet would cut out every morning at 2 am. It did this every single morning. I called Comcast to let them know of the trouble and that it was an issue for us, since we would use the internet at that time of the day. The customer support representative said that it was a very simple issue. She said Comcast was sending updates to the router and modem and for whatever reason, the updates weren't making it from the modem to the router. Her suggestion was to simply reset the modem and router every time the Internet cut out. That suggestion seemed a bit non-caring and ridiculous. I shouldn't have to power cycle my equipment every time I want to connect to the internet. Then the disconnections started happening more frequently, especially during the nighttime hours. Every time the Internet would disconnect, the phone service would shut off too. I called Comcast again and complained that we can't use services we are paying for. I told the customer service representative that I was calling from a payphone, since their phone service was too unreliable to carry on a conversation. And all calls would cut out after a minute or two.The representative confirmed that it wasn't a problem with our router, since the phone service doesn't even go through it. The representative also said they would send a technician out to check the modem and the cable line. Then the technician replaced all the line from the pole to the house, replaced some splitters, and replaced our modem. She also found a problem we didn't know we were having. When she connected her device up to our cable line, she said we weren't getting all the TV channels that we were supposed to be getting. We hadn't noticed this, since we don't watch that much TV. After she replaced the equipment, she did another test with her device saying she noticed a drastic improvement but admitted that the signal was still not in proper specs. Since the internet appeared to be working at that moment, she left saying to call Comcast if we had any further issues. Sure enough, the problem came back immediately. The next tech Comcast sent out checked everything, replaced some cable lines inside the house, and left. Nothing he did fixed the problem. Then one of our many TV boxes quit working altogether and wouldn't pick up any stations. Comcast sent a tech to replace that and to try to check on our internet problem. The technician replaced the TV box and got the TV signal working again but wasn't able to do anything for the internet.I called Comcast to complain again. At this point, they offered me 6 months of Showtime for free. That was meaningless to us, since we hardly watch TV and it in no way helps the internet problem. A discount on our bill would have been more appreciated. At this point, Comcast told me they would send out a field tech, since the regular techs couldn't solve the problem, and that he would definitely be able to solve it. The field tech came out and seemed to understand exactly what the problem was but not what was causing it. He decided to rewire the inside yet again. When doing so, he felt voltage running through the line. I felt the lines and sure enough, it was comparable to a strong 9V battery. He immediately said he was done there and that we were causing the problem ourselves. He said our house wasn't properly grounded and that we were feeding voltage back into the system thus causing our own problem. How he was so sure of this, I don't know, since he did not use any devices or equipment to confirm this. We were charged $40 for that tech to come out. After his visit, we had all the outlets properly grounded and tested the ground to make sure it was a good ground and worked properly. It did. Since our internet problems had been progressively getting worse, I called Comcast again. And again, they sent out a technician. This tech appeared to have the best understanding of the problem. After giving him a history of the problem and what had been done thus far, he watched the modem lights and confirmed we had a real and serious problem. He said he would go outside and test the line to see whether or not we ourselves were sending voltage and noise back into the system. That is a test that the field tech should have done but didn't.After he finished his test, he confirmed that our house was not causing any noise and there wasn't any voltage feeding back in the line. He then told us that the problem was being caused by one of our neighbors. He said that one of their houses was creating high voltage and feeding noise into the system. He apologized for the fact that he wouldn't be able to fix it right away and said to give him 2 or 3 days to isolate which house was causing the problem. He gave us a cell number and said to call him directly if we were still having problems after that. Two days later, the problem appeared to be fixed. A couple more days later, the problem came back fully. We called the number several times and left a message but never got any call backs. That was not surprising. I called Comcast, and they said they knew nothing of it and that according to their map, our neighborhood was just fine. This was in contradiction to what the representatives had told me in earlier phone calls. On more than one of my previous calls to them, the customer support representative had checked their area map and said ""yes"" that they can see that there are some service issues in the neighborhood area.So basically depending on who you talk to, they will either admit or deny a neighborhood-wide problem. Eventually the last representative I spoke to apologized and said there was nothing that Comcast could do at all. She did not offer any sort of compensation or any discount on our monthly bill, even though she admitted we weren't getting proper service. I explained that I was thinking of switching to Qwest for internet service, and the representative told me that that would not help. She told me that Qwest uses the same lines and poles and that even if I switched over to them, we would continue to have this same problem. At that point, I decided to wait just a little longer before cancelling services. As of now, we have cancelled our TV and phone service but still subscribe to internet. Our problem still exists. I don't know what to do. Also, in the past week, aside from the random disconnects, our speed has dropped significantly. We are paying for the 20 Mbps service, and as of a few weeks ago, we were getting that with an average of 23 Mbps. Now, the best we can get is 3 Mbps. The slowest speed Comcast offers on their website is 15 Mbps. So something is clearly wrong.I don't know what to do anymore, and I get the distinct impression that Comcast is taking advantage of us and doesn't care as long as we keep paying the bill. Is there no law that requires them to keep their end of the agreement? We can't afford to pay $40 every time we need a tech out here, which is always."
1,"I contacted Comcast /Xfinity, to get their triple play service on December 19, 2009. I talked to Alesia ** and she set up for a pre-post for Sunday January 3, 2010. The tech came out said he needed to get to the basement of the apartment building I was moving into. We set for someone to comeback on the following Thursday, the 7 of January. That tech said the basement was flooded. He said he would need to put in for a construction permit to dig a trench from the apartment to the end of the building. I found out they were subcontractors for Comcast, this was on January 21, they did not notify Comcast. I called Comcast that day and told them what their subcontractor told me. I then told them I needed my Internet by the 1st of February. They could not guaranty it, so I told them I'll vet phone and Internet from someone else until they could get me hooked up.Every month, I'd receive a call from Comcast saying they were sending someone out to book me up, no show. That continued for months. A costumer service rep. named Bob contacted me to set up for a tech to vet me hooked up. That was in July of 2010. In August, a tech came out and split service of the apartment from above me just temporary, supposedly, so I would have the triple play. The phone and TV worked well, but my high speed Internet was slow and would kick me off line within minutes to no more then an hour of being online. I called Comcast letting them know I was having problems with the Internet. I thought it was the Norton Security was doing it. I forgot my hook up was split from another apartment. Weak signal or weak stream coming into the apartment plus split 3 ways to go to 3 TVs. I called Comcast Sunday, the 3 of April 2011. They set up for a tech to come out Tuesday the 5th of April 2011.I showed him the so called temporary hook up and let him do his test on my computer and he checked the dream/signal from the split outside of the apartment and said they need to do the pre-post to get me the proper stream/signal to come into the apartment. I was told it won't be done overnight. He seen from prior paperwork that the prepost was originally scheduled in July of 2010. He then called Comcast and put in for the proper prepost again to be done. I had to call Comcast every time I got on my computer to try to see what could be done about my lack of Internet stability and why was I still being charged for a service. I've been billed for and not receiving. I was then told they would credit me for a month that I first said it was due to Comcast not having me hooked up properly. And that I had to wait for them to solve the problem before they could credit me. Ever since I called them, my Internet service is getting worse. I've done drugging they told me to do from deleting the cookies, cache, to resetting the box to doing Norton massive computer clean up of spy and adware scans, which showed there were no viruses. I was calling a lot since the 3 of April. They say it will be 2 weeks before a date for them to get come to do the digging of the trench for the prepost will be set and don't know how long it can take for that date to actually take place. I now have an even harder time to vet on line and stay than I did prior to me having complain and the tech come out to let them know what the problem was. This is the reason why I am putting in a complaint on Comcast/ Xfinity."
1,"My name is Kenneth ** and I am the President of a fairly large electrical contracting company that currently resides in Worcester Massachusetts. The name of our company is New Horizons Technologies Inc. The current address of our company is in Worcester, but we have recently purchased a new place of business that is located at ** in Sterling Massachusetts. We closed on this new property on November 19th, 2010. Since purchasing this property, we have completely renovated it, bringing the office space up to date, improving the exterior of the buildings and upgrading all of the utilities, and systems at this location. We have basically taken an old historic former rail station, then Lumber yard and brought it back to life with a new found character and meaning to the town of Sterling and the neighbor hood it is located in. When done we will have spent over Four Hundred Thousand Dollars on this place to make it a modern, functional, thriving place of business.The Town of Sterling has been wonderful to deal with including the Building Departments, Inspectional Services, Fire Department, and local utilities. They have been very accommodating and a pleasure to work with. They understand the value of a company like us moving in and updating a property such as this and what it brings to the community. Us moving into a location like this adds value to all of the real estate around us because of how we increased the value of this property, it helps the other local businesses in the area with increased volume of business because of the 70 employees we bring to the area to do business in that area. We hope to continue to grow and provide opportunity for additional hires from this area to add to our work force.This Recession and current economy have been very hard on small businesses like ours as you very well aware. I have been doing this for over 23 years now and this is by far the worst period I have ever seen. To be honest, I am not even sure our business model even works now with the new set of rules that are out there to compete in this economy, but we are trying our best to survive and to make it to the end of this period. We actually had a decent 2010 so , we decided to invest in property and to stop renting and hopefully 2010 was an indicator of things to come. So we bought the property in Sterling and hoped to make this our new home to take us into the next decade and help with setting us up to be prosperous into the next decade.The purpose for this letter is to inform you, and also ask for your help in dealing with Comcast. We have electricity, we have gas, we have phone service, but we have no internet service. The only player in town is Comcast and our hands are tied. We can only deal with them. We first contacted them on February 28th, one month ago today. We are planning on moving into our new office this Friday April 1st at the close of business on that day and opening for business on Monday April 4th. They are now telling us we will not have internet service for approximately another 3 weeks. We have documented all phone calls and internet dealings with them. They have been totally slow, unresponsive, and non-caring about our situation. Basically treating us like a number and could care less about our situation. I have no idea if there are more complaints, many complaints or no complaints about Comcast and their service, but I feel I needed to write you and every other person in politics and the media who might listen. I have been totally shocked to find out that it takes 6 to 8 weeks to get internet service to a business line ours in the town of Sterling. We deal with municipalities all the time. Getting power, telephone and internet service for our clients. We know the routine, we know the pitfalls and the steps needed, but dealing with Comcast has been the worst. Just totally unresponsive to our needs and time frame.They need to run a cable 700 from where it is currently dead ended on the street. They say that is one of the reasons they cannot do it quickly because they need to schedule that part to get that wire strung on the poles. The other is they say they need a police detail. I tell them that we know what it takes to string a cable 700, and we know what it takes to get a police detail and both can happen very easily with a little bit of effort. They do this every day all day. They prefer to put up barriers instead of removing them. They prefer to stop business instead of helping it.Basically, I read all the time about how politicians talk about providing jobs, helping small business to succeed, to provide an atmosphere where businesses can prosper so they can hire new employees. Everyday I see on the news how it is so important to get America back on its feet, to get people back to work, to buy properties and help out neighbor hoods they are located in. To get the most important segment of our industry hiring again, which is small businesses. Well, here is a perfect situation. We have done everything with out no kick backs or buy outs from the governments, no tax credits and no assistance what so ever. I just need Comcast to give us internet service. They were given this monopoly by our government and now they stand in the way of business progressing. This is just not right. We are not a 100 billion dollar bank, insurance company, or car manufacturer, we are an 8 million dollar a year small business trying to survive.Technology is so very important to our business and every business out there. I keep hearing that the government wants the internet brought to every household in the country. Well, we use it and need it and cannot run with out it. The impact to our business is in the tens of thousands with out it. If the government is going to give these companies a monopoly in these towns, the government needs to apply pressure to these companies when they are not serving the good of the community.Hopefully there is something that can be done here. Business as usual with Comcast needs to stop. Maybe we cannot be helped, but others may be able to be in the future."
1,"I called Comcast to schedule an appointment to have internet installed on 2/17 between 5 and 8 p.m. On 2/17, I received a call at 4:00 p.m. and I informed the technician that I would be home at 5 p.m. I arrived at 4:45 but no one ever showed up. I called them at 9:30 p.m. and they rescheduled for the following day. They didn't offer any compensation until I said I will just go with Verizon. I talked to 4 different people who put me on hold for long periods of time and finally rescheduled and was compensated with 50 dollar credit. On 2/18, I arrived home at the same time and was scheduled for an appointment between 5 and 8 p.m. I received a call from Comcast trying to sell me other services. I never received a call from a technician and no one showed up.I then called Comcast and was again put on hold for long periods of time. I then spoke with a gentlemen who told me a previous tenant had defaulted on their bill so I would have to show proof of SSN and other documentation. This has been one of the most frustrating ordeals in my life. Everyone gave me different answers and put me on hold. And never did anyone tell me I had to provide a copy of my SSN and other documentation. This is the worst customer service I have ever seen in my life. I am now out over 100 dollars of lost work pay and several hours of frustration waiting for them to install. And then to be told I need documentation because a previous tenant defaulted. This is pretty sad that a large established company can treat people this way and get away with it. I hope there is something you can do to help me. This will be very much appreciated."
1,"I contracted high speed Internet from Comcast more or less three weeks ago. When the technician came to install it, he said there was no Comcast service in that building and that they should’ve told me that. He also said this is the third time he came to my building with the same problem, that Comcast never installs the box in the basement to provide service to the building. Why then does Comcast allow you to do all the process and nobody told you? Well, probably it is due to the incompetence of that company. But the worst is that I already bought a router and a modem ($114) from them and since two weeks ago nobody is answering my mails or my calls to put a solution to this problem. Where are the good service and the respect for the costumers? Even the Rich Germano group is answering my emails.I just want an answer and my money back! I spent $114 in a modem plus router, but it’s been one month without Internet. That means I’m paying Netflix for nothing and at least 4 calls per day leaving messages to an answering machine."
1,"   Sadly I've been cursed with 8 years of living in regions of Oregon that have only 1 high-speed Internet provider: Comcast.  My complaints are many, but can be boiled down like this:First off, they charge an ""installation fee"" which typically costs about as much as 1.5 months worth of Internet.  So even if you start on their service with the typical 6-month promo, they've already walked off with a substantial part of the anticipated savings.  The last time I moved, the installation wasn't done properly and it took an hour on the phone with Customer Service to get it solved {they still had to charge me full price for the originally botched installation though}.They charge monthly rental fees on their cable modems which they just toss into bins when you return them...no wonder my first cable modem from them only worked for an average of 6 hours/day.When I tried to set-up auto-withdraw to pay the bills, they managed to set it up so all the bills got paid a month late.  Then they started calling to say my bills were overdue and I'd point out that was impossible beings it was on auto-bill pay.   They'd agree & promise to get it fixed...I guess it resolved fast because it only three months of calls back & forth to finally get it reset properly.As soon as an alternative service became available in my area last year, I changed.  I noticed instant improvements: the new service was just as fast, 20% cheaper, free installation (properly installed), and they gave me a FREE wireless router to support 4 wired-computers (previously I'd had to buy my own router because Comcast's cable modem had exactly 1 slot for a computer, no wireless support).Beings they now had a local competitor, Comcast started a ""fear"" campaign by mail & billboard pointing out that this new company was ""going leave it's customers hanging"" and they were offering ""special rates"" to anyone changing back to their service. That was a year ago and I couldn't help but laugh when I heard last week that Comcast was raising it's rates (again).  Apparently it's costs are going up (their CEO just needs that extra little Christmas bonus probably).  Somehow, my new service is doing just fine with it's current rate (which is comparable to what I was paying 4 years ago with Comcast)."
1,"Apparently I suddenly needed an upper case letter in my 'safe' password. Why? Only Comcast knows; this meant of course that my windows 'memory' of my password had to be changed. All this, for what? It's always, always, from Comcast with no explanation. They are apparently run by people who don't really give a **** about their customers - just the money.  Any lawyers reading this? I speak hypothetically, of course. I worked for doctors & lawyers before I retired. Guess what? Along with the majority of people, I am ashamed of most of you."
1,"My internet and phone service keeps coming and going.  I called yesterday and they checked the line and said that the modem had reset itself 26 times in two days and said that I needed service.  They said that they would send someone today 11-2.  The automated message called four times prior to the visit to confirm that I still needed the service.  I waited but no one showed up and about 1:00, I am getting automated voice mails to rate my service.  The problem is that no one ever came.  I did an online chat but that person was useless and had no idea why it happened or if someone was coming or not. I called at four and they just said sorry and rescheduled me for tomorrow, same time.  I complained and said that I was not waiting all day and give me a one hour time block when they would show up.  He said, impossible, then I said to put me on the phone with the supervisor.  I spoke with Reggie then he said that he will give me 8-11 tomorrow but don't know if he can do anything.  I told them to give me the first appointment and we shall see.  Needless to say, I am pissed.I want to cancel but, of course, that takes research and time to get a new service.  They totally act like they have no control and don't care.  How hard is it to actually call whoever is scheduled to come and communicate?"
1,"My wife called at 8AM and was put on hold listening to music until 9AM.  She lost an hour of wages because nobody came back on the line.  If they can't be in the service business, then they should get out.  We are a long-standing customer of Comcast and expect some remuneration for her time lost.  It seems that the bigger they are getting, the worst the service."
1,"I haven't had internet service for the past three months and still received a bill. I became delinquent because I refused to pay if I didn't receive service. My cable went out, so I haven’t had TV for two weeks. I called today and was rejected from the automated machine because my area code is from a different state. I was transferred about eight times, which is seriously irritating. And I had to repeat my complaint along with account number four times. All I got was the run-around and the last time I was so livid I started crying and the representative hung up on me after I spent 40 minutes on the phone wasting my time and having accomplished nothing. So I am still delinquent. I still have service since nothing was cancelled or even done. I don't even want to call anymore because I’ll blow up if someone transfers me again. "
1,"After having a scheduled appointment (land line and internet install); they refused to have their technicians visit my home without me having a functional contact number. I waited for a technician for over 4 hours without a visit to my home. I contacted Comcast employees and were given a twenty dollar credit, without a visit. Note: no call and no show. Total mental damage due to lack of customer service and Comcast breaking verbal agreements. "
1,"I'm paying $54.95 per month for Comcast's ""Blast"" cable Internet service, which is supposed to be 16mbps. This was the case until approximately 2 months ago, when the speed suddenly dropped to around 3 to 5 Mbps.I've made several calls to Comcast's tech support for assistance without any success. One tech support person (Stephanie), who obviously didn't know what she was doing, got frustrated and hung up on me. A technician made a house call, but said that my service was as good as everyone else in the area was getting, even though I did several speed tests while he watched, which confirmed my claim of slow connection speeds.I also went to a couple of websites which loaded web pages slowly, but he still claimed that, according to his wi-fi meter, my connection was fine, and there was nothing he could do. After calling tech support several more times, I was told that Comcast couldn't do anything about the problem, and they wished me good luck with it."
1,"My internet connection has been going out for over a year and just got a lot worse in August. My connection went down every single day for 2-3 weeks. There have been 6 technicians that came out but none have been able to help. Every time I call they just want to send a tech. Then by the time the tech comes out everything is working, so there is nothing they can do.Since I work from home, this has caused me to lose quite a bit of money and have been suspended from employers. Today I started training for a new job and I cannot miss a day of class or I will be disqualified, and my connection keeps going in and out, which caused me to lose 3 hours of training. I am now waiting for a response from the trainer to determine if I will be allowed to continue training tomorrow. I have lost $2,711 over a year as a result of hours I have lost because of Comcast."
1,"My Comcast bill for internet and cable was 190.00 a month. My buddy has Comcast internet and all cable channels plus HD and phone, all for 87.00 a month so I called to complain. I got my bill dropped to 105.00 a month, just internet and cable. To my surprise, my internet no longer worked. Two days later, still no internet and no quick fix in site. If you're smart, you will run from Comcast. They don't have customer service and nobody wants to help when they screw up."
1,"Just the worst customer service and lack of taking responsibility for their mistakes I have ever seen. As a new customer initially for internet and cable, the screw ups began with late for the installation and over billing were somewhat fixable but clearly a pain in the **. Now comes the migration to their phone service because my soon to be ex-wife wanted the phone services out of her name. Thus migrating the home number from T-Mobile home service to Comcast. I gave Comcast 10 days notice and informed T-Mobile of the transition. Comcast was called 3 times to confirm the transfer of the number from T-Mobile to Comcast. All three times, everything was confirmed for a transfer on the date of installation. When the service technician showed up with the new modem he had an entirely new number and knew nothing about the old number that was to be used. Subsequent calls to customer service and being put on hold for over 35 minutes only resulted in an insincere, ""Gees... were sorry,"" and the fact that they never did what they said they were going to do. It will take 5-10 days for them to contact T-Mobile and make the change. There was/is no making up for their mistake and no promise that they will get the job done as promised. These ** guys suck and if you have a choice for other providers in your area, use them."
1,"Over the past year, I have made no less than 20 service calls by phone for a variety of problems.  On several occasions a repairman was sent with mixed results and a variety of reasons for loss of service.  Lately the audio from the cable TV has been dropping out.  This loss of audio has been happening every few days.  I have to regularly reboot the system, on the average of once a week.  No one has been sent to really look into this chronic problem.  Comcast is always quick to apologize and has offered some credits to my account on occasion.  Neither their apology nor the credits make up for an inferior system and very poor service.  I do not have experience with any other company at this point in time.  If you are looking for a problem and some frustration, select Comcast as your provider!"
1,"At the end of September 2010, I relocated from Michigan to Florida, and gave Comcast advance notice. I wanted to be sure that I would have internet service up until the time I left, and that I did not need cable TV as I was very busy with clearing out the house and moving. I let Comcast know what date I expected to leave, and we agreed to continue the internet service for two days after my departure, to ensure that I would not be without.The Saturday before I left, I took the two converter boxes to Comcast's Lyndon St. office in Detroit and made sure that I got my receipt for them, because I had heard the horror stories of what happens if you don't. I was hoping to avoid that nightmare, but it made little difference. I just got a call this morning that they were going to hand me over to collections for the equipment that was not turned in. Luckily, I have my little pink receipt to prove that I turned them in.When I called last week to find out why I couldn't get into my email account, the customer service rep told me that he saw that I still had their equipment, and I told him that I had a receipt and would scan and forward a copy by email, if necessary. He suggested that I contact Comcast Customer Loyalty to find out about getting access to my email account.This past Saturday, 10/16/2010, my wife made the call to Comcast Customer Loyalty as we only have cell lines, and Saturdays do not count against our minutes. I still wanted to find out if I could either have access to my email account that they closed without informing me in advance, or if they could at least forward all of my email to another address. My wife wanted assurance that Comcast had noted that they did indeed have their equipment back.The first rep told her that since the account was already closed, there was nothing that could be done about accessing my email account or forwarding it to another email address. She was then transferred to Edna to find out about if the equipment issue was resolved. Edna told my wife that she saw in their system where I had turned the equipment in, and that she figured that the customer service rep that I had talked to the week before did not go deep enough into our account information to see that we had our own modem, and that was probably the outstanding equipment that he was referring to. She was very quick, though to see to it that Comcast got their money for the two days that my service was left open after my departure. She assured my wife that she would waive the fee for taking a check over the phone, as we could not pay it online because we no longer had an open account! And with the outstanding fees being taken care of, we would not have to be bothered by Comcast again. Oh, and we never got a bill at our new address either, so I am kind of wondering just how did they intend getting the rest of their money. I did make sure though, that they had my forwarding address. Comcast may have sent the final bill to my old address, and it has just not gotten to me yet.In conclusion, I am hoping that with my return phone call to Comcast regarding the collections issue, they will forward me something indicating that I am now free and clear of them forever. They did give me a case number for future reference, this time with a projected closed by date of November 4, 2010. I will never, ever be tempted to use Comcast in the future. It's like a bad marriage from which you can have the devil of a time getting out of."
1,"I called Comcast on 10/01/2010 and ordered the new Internet 2go said the order was in and would see this item by 10/6/2010. Well, since then till 10/11/2010, I have called and asked for a tracking number and they keep saying they do not have one but it shipped. Today, I called them and they admitted it has not shipped and this was a new item for them in this area an they were trying to figure out where it was, but it look like it did not ship and they did not know how to ship it but would call me about 6 pm on 10/12/2010.Well, as you guessed it, they did not call so I called them back, again that nice apology, let me put you on hold an I will talk to a supervisor. On hold for 5 minutes and she came back and said there still working on it and earlier in the day I asked it to be shipped red and ship me another one. Guess what? They still wanna look for the other one.Earlier in the day was also told they did not know how to or where they are at to ship. I also said hum you must new on the job and seems no one knows what to do with any training and she said I been here only three days. Being in the customer service industry, big bells and whistles went of no training, high turn over, everything is scripted. Such a shame , I am now handicapped and I was gonna use this technology to make my life easier away from home. Maybe Comcast should start listening to there customers. Is Verizon FIOS any better? Lost of time and wages plus stress = $500.00"
1,"I had to move my desktop computer from an upstairs room to a lower level room. (I live in 3 level townhouse). My internet connection was extremely slow so I called Comcast customer service. My first call was 10/03/10, (speaking to Sherry, Ranjani, Shawn, Barry, Chad and Adriane).After being transferred and given various phone numbers and speaking to the above people totaling 3 hours, Adriane claimed the problem was solved. Later on, the internet disconnected. I called customer service again. I spoke with Terea, I explained to her my problem and I was told that I would have to move my router closer to the desktop. So she scheduled an appointment for Saturday 10/09/10 bet. 2pm-5pm. Comcast's automated system called to confirm the appointment on Friday night 10/08/10. The automation again called Saturday morning 10/09/10 to confirm. After no one showing up, at 5:15pm on 10/09/10, I called Comcast to get the status on the technician and was told by Brenda that the appointment was canceled. I asked why and was told that Terea put the order in as a troubleshooting problem, so Comcast canceled the appointment. I was furious. I asked for a supervisor, where Taurean ** came on the phone. He begin to tell me that someone tried to inform me during the week of the cancellation but my mailbox was full.I said that was not true. My messages were checked everyday and besides, I had 2 confirmation calls as recent as the day of the appointment. After going back and forth, Mr. Taurean tried to give me an appointment during the week. I told him I work for a living that's why I had a Saturday appointment. He said the next Saturday appointment was in November. I was not happy and told him that was unacceptable. He then said he would call the Expedite dept to see if I could get an evening appointment and he would call me back the next day.Meanwhile, my internet went down completely Saturday night and I had to call the internet dept to get it working again after about 30 minutes. On Sunday, 10/10/10, Nicole from the Expedite dept called to reschedule my appointment for Tuesday 10/12/10 bet 5pm-8pm. When I asked her name she hung up on me, (fortunately she started speaking on my answering machine when I picked up the phone, that's how I got her name). Since the,n my internet has gone down again (total, 3 times) and I had to call the internet dept once again for service. The gentlemen from internet tech support times were very nice and helpful. But I must say Comcast's overall customer service has been horrible and disenchanting. All this to get my router moved from one location to another. I told the supervisor that I would file a complaint and; that's what I'm doing. I wanted to make this agency aware of Comcast's poor customer service. "
1,"My internet and phone landline were down. I called Comcast and was told that there was trouble in my area and technicians were working on the problem. The next day, still no internet and phones. I called Comcast again and was told that they would send a technician to my house the next day between 5PM and 8PM to resolve the problem. I received an automated call from Comcast confirming the time of the service call. I waited until 8PM and no serviceman arrived. I called Comcast and was told that I would be on hold for 7 minutes, I waited for 13 minutes and finally spoke to a Comcast rep. I explained that the repairman from Comcast had not arrived. She said it was an hour later at her location (Eastern standard time). She said she would check and she put me on hold. She never returned to the phone. I waited another 20 minutes and finally, another service rep, Lisa, picked up the phone. I had to start from the beginning and explained my situation again. She put me on hold and she never returned to the phone. I waited another 10 minutes and a man from Houston customer service picked up the phone. I had to explain my situation a third time. He told me that my service call to my house had been canceled because the problem was areawide. He stated that someone should have called me and advised me of the canceled appointment. Since my home phone was not working, I was using my cell phone and used up about 60 minutes of time. I am going to look for another company that can offer me the service I need and also has good customer service. I think Comcast has grown so fast that it cannot service all their customers."
1,"Comcast is the absolute worst company. I have their service now and it has been nonstop problems. I would recommend people to avoid this company entirely. I will never use them again and am switching as soon as I can get AT&T to get out here. First of all, their customer service is the absolute worst. After having numerous problems with my connection over a few months time, I finally decided I wanted to complain to upper management. Good luck. I used the online chat service and was told the first name of the Supervisor. I specifically asked for a name, phone number and email. Well, I was told he could not give me that information but I could email comcast.com with my problem. He refused to give me the information I requested., ""Oh no it takes 24-72 hours.""I asked him why the sales guy would tell me 2-3 hours and he said he had no idea. Basically, I was lied to. I was upset and the gentleman said, he would escalate my problem to a supervisor and they would get it done with 24 hours and give me an email. Surprise, surprise, no new speeds, no email. I contacted them a third time and was told, ""Oh no, no upgrade was processed."" So, they never even upgraded my service, even though I talked to them twice.This third time, he swore he was adding the upgrade and it would be done within an hour? An hour? How is that possible? This company is ridiculous. They lie, they are incompetent, they are rude, and they don't even give paying customers information requested. Never order Comcast. And now that AT&T has U-verse there is no reason to stay with a company that treats it's customers like this. "
1,"I would like to talk to some knowledgeable person about cable TV broadcast decisions on broadcasting in HD or standard, as well as internet speed before I make embarrassing complaints."
1,"Also some of my video on my site at some point was not working. Guess what? Comcast had decided to turn on a firewall in my modem which blocked all my video. Great! Got that fixed with help desk.Tech guy did great job. Figured out that modem was old, wire in our yard was old and insufficient. So, he put temporary solution. Everything back up. Great! As happy as a little kid. Then came techs to put real wire. Everything low again after that. So other tech came back out and fixed things again. So happy for a while.Today decided to check again my speed, guess what? Yes, Comcast was super slow again. Called help desk. Tomorrow another tech comes out. Frankly, I hate Comcast, I don't trust them. I will give them another chance. Oh, forgot to mention, they charged my $27 for a ""Customer Complaint Call"". How about that? Deliver a lousy service and charge for that. Comcast should be very rich. Anyone out there. If you have other options, consider them first!"
1,"About 3 weeks ago, I was told Comcast was no longer going to support McAfee and I had to change to Norton. I changed to Norton and since then I receive 30 to 100 spams going out every day to my contacts. When I called Comcast, they said they don't support Norton; I need to call Norton or MSN, or anyone else they think of. I have wasted 1 hour and 15 minutes today alone trying to get someone to agree to come out here and fix it. They said it is my fault and I have to fix it. Well, if they can't, how do they think I can? I have paid for technical help for 10 years and never had this kind of trouble. Yesterday, after 45 minutes on the line with Norton/Symantec, they could not fix it, I should call someone else.Every place I called put me on a phone tree, wasted my time, and all they could do was apologize and say they couldn't fix it. I have done everything suggested, for the first few weeks. I handled them calmly, but now I am enraged and threatening them. What else can I do when a company offers and accepts payment for a service that doesn't work? There is no other option for cable and I pay $120 of my disability income."
1,"According to the Comcast website, the following internet service options exist: Performance up to 15Mbps, Blast up to 20Mbps, and Extreme 50 up to 50Mbps.  Yet, when you call on the phone, you are told that Performance is 6-12Mbps and Blast is up to 16Mbps.  Which one is correct?  And shouldn't the advertised rates apply?  Actual rates are typically less than advertised.  But given that Comcast keeps putting out promotions, it’s become insulting to be overpaying to services that will never be provided, and they know about it.  "
1,"Early June 2010, I canceled my Comcast internet services. Almost three passed, Comcast still hold me $50 for equipment fee. I told them four times I did not own their any equipment since I used my modem, which shown on my bill. But I haven't gotten money yet. I want all Comcast customers watch their pocket when deal with Comcast, the company has no trust."
1,"Comcast provided me internet service. I went to their security web page to download the Norton Security Suite, that was free to charge for their customers, and after downloading the software onto two computers, my computers are now inoperative. I have called the corporate office and was told they only had about 10 complaints out of their 2.2 million customers, and that is not enough complaints to do anything about them.  It resulted in me losing 2 hard drives. My fiance has his own construction company that he is starting, and all our contacts, and business material, is now lost due to me downloading a virus protection from Comcast."
1,"My internet went down about two months ago. Comcast had 6 different technicians come out to fix the problem. I lost 1 month of internet access and probably 24 hours of my life on hold with Comcast. Almost, every time a tech would come out, they would replace my modem and leave. A couple hours later, the internet would go out again. I'd call Comcast back, be hold for hours, and wait 10 days for another tech to show up whenever he felt like it. Finally, Comcast decided that the problem was not my modem (after they changed it 3 times). The problem was at the pole at the front of the neighborhood. Comcast has aggravated everyone in the neighborhood, because we all had the same problem. And because of Comcast's incompetence, it took them 1 month to figure it out. I canceled Comcast, returned my equipment, and again, requested my modem back at the Orange Park branch. The lady was very rude to me and told me I must have a receipt for the modem I purchased years ago. You can see that there is a modem on my account that is not Comcast's. Apparently, that was not proof enough that I owned a modem. To top it off, I received a notice today that Comcast was sending a collector after me for one of their modems. No doubt, one of the three that the tech's switched out. Wow, Comcast has so much nerve. They are fraudulently charging me for not returning their modem, while they have also stolen my mine. "
1,"My Comcast highspeed internet (highspeed is a term they use loosely) takes forever to run on our PC and constantly drops offline (no connectivity, can't find server, can't find home router which is less than five feet away, drops activity if phone rings or cable station is changed on TV, and etc.) a hundred times a day. A call for tech support can take hours and then I am told the problem is with the computer, or the router or the laptop, never their problem. I have all of these items checked by Best Buy and everything works perfectly for them (yes, I took everything in and watched how fast and reliable it all worked). I am now considering suing Comcast for contract breech of service and mental pain and suffering. "
1,"A recent internet failure prompted me to call for repair/svc, and during the call, I was told that they determined that my modem was not working. During discussion of the modem issue, they told me that the modem was their equipment that I was leasing it. Funny thing is, I bought the modem myself, (still have the box and price tag) and they then went on to ""prove"" that it was theirs because they knew the serial # and mac address. Somehow, they forgot that I supplied those #s as part of getting their system to recognize it to allow it to function (they tried this ""ID"" scam twice!). They went on to inform me that I had been paying $5 a month for nearly a year as the lease fee (online billing isn't as good/detailed as I would like, so we never noticed). I haven't decided whether or not to consult an attorney or perhaps the District Atty or even the State AG, yet. And, as a little kicker of abuse, it turned out that my modem was fine. Someone unknown, but using a Comcast-typical device, had actually dead-headed the cable at the point it connects to my house, as they would do when a bill is unpaid (which mine was not, ever). The service tech who found the ""problem"" showed up about 2 hours late as well, and the time spent on the phone so far is about two hours (still unresolved). Comcast's standard solution for all this **? So far, they are offering $20 for the blown service appointment (""That's all we're allowed to do.""). A half day wasted and they offer $20. You get no consideration for the make-up visit if they miss the first one. You just eat another morning or afternoon waiting. "
1,"Simply put, there is no such thing as ""high speed"" with regards to Comcast internet service. It does not exist. You can follow any directions, be it from email or on your bill provided by Comcast and it will not increase the speed of your computer. They are nothing but a monopoly whose business and service we are, unfortunately, stuck with. God bless the business that finally comes forth and challenges them. They could offer the same services but charge reasonable prices and would earn a fortune!"
1,"We are new to Alabama. We were moved here by United Van Lines/King Relocator/Car Transport. Danilo requested service at this private property in Legg Park. During May, he requested wireless service and through many calls, was unable to connect the service. We have two computers, one Mac Apple and one Windows PC. We wanted service so we could use both computers. In June, after another failed attempt, Danilo asked what the additional cost would be for a second modem which we are guaranteed in the privacy of our home 8MG. On June 11th, an installation tech came to our home and installed a second modem. We discovered that we can only have 1MG with the second modem. We called Comcast whom we allowed to enter our private home to provide this service. We were told that this service will be $5 more a month. We called to talk to Comcast and were told we can not have more MG because we wanted 2 modem. We were told we could only have better connection if we had the wireless. When explained the failed connection, there was no resolution. We received a bill for double the amount or 60 a month for internet. We felt that this is fraud because we were told 8MG and only have 1MG. We were falsely led to believe that this would only be an additional $5 but were charged like two household instead of one.This seems to be non-disclosure. I spoke clearly, I said I do not like this, like they entered our home with the intent to defraud us of money, make us pay for their fraud, false advertisement, lack of disclosure in the privacy of our home. They never said they did not understand English, they never said they did not know what I said, but intended to use our sincere intents for fraud and money gains. When told there was a problem, they said there is no solution and no correction, but we must pay for lack of disclosure. They don't know what they are doing or where they are. They cannot hear and refused to listen to what is being said. I returned the modem after being told that they will not correct this and will charge us double for what we will not get. They walked in to the privacy of our home to commit fraud. They are using our home to make money and refuse to respect, communicate. They are actually insulting. They were offensive. After listening to verbal communication, they did not understand they would never be authorized to enter our home if they told the truth or were honest."
1,"I have been trying to reach Comcast all day via their toll-free phone numbers and have received an error message or busy signal each time.  On top of that, the past few days, my modem has been losing its IP address roughly six times a day."
1,"This is just the latest in a series of Comcast customer service nightmares. I am named on the account as is my wife. Since I pay the bill, I wanted to pay it online. Of course, there is no easy way to do this so I called Comcast. I talked to 4 different people and got 4 different answers. One said that both my wife and I would have to go to a service center and show ID photos to get my name as the one that pays the account. Finally, I asked to talk to a supervisor. I was told that the supervisor was not available. I said that I would wait. After insisting that I wasn’t going anywhere, a supervisor got on and said that they would email me a form to fill out which I would then have to bring to a service center and there is a $10 fee.My wife was with me when I called. She could have gotten on and verified her SSN. All I wanted to do is pay them online. It is a benefit to them yet I have to pay them $10 to change that pays them? People thought Enron took people for a ride. With my last problem with Comcast, it was not resolved until I emailed the president of Comcast. They are a nightmare to deal with. If I had a viable alternative I would drop them in a minute."
1,"Last month, we signed up with Comcast for our internet & upgrade of our cable service. Nothing has worked properly since that time. My husband has been on the phone with technicians and representatives countless times. We don't get half of the channels we are suppose to be getting or if we do get them, they are scrambled. Since when does channels 2/5/7 & 9 not come in. Our internet service is pathetic. Lets put it this way, if we want to use our internet service, we have to wait until after 5:00 p.m. It never works before that. It always is saying Comcast is having a server problem or Comcast's server is slow today. The whole problem is Comcast's infrastructure. We live in a low-income area where most of the people can't even afford cable. Comcast ignores replacing old lines with new ones in those areas. They don't care! My husband is getting ready to call Comcast one more time this afternoon. If Comcast does not get on the stick and fix this problem, they lost a customer. I will cancel my phone, cable and internet and go elsewhere. I am not going to pay close to $200.00 per month for something that works not even half the time. Would you? In this economy, no one has money to throw away."
1,"Back in February 2010, I switched our telephone, high-speed internet, and cable TV services over to the Comcast Xfinity plan.  My previous provider on the phone lines was AT&T.  Everything seemed okay at first.  But in July, I accidentally set off my alarm system.  We did not receive the customary call from our alarm system service, so I called them.  They stated that it was probable that Comcast had not installed the line for the alarm properly and I should call them.  I called Comcast and arranged for a technician to come on a Saturday.  The young man arrived, looked around, messed with some wires, and then asked me to test.  It still did not work.  A woman from the alarm system company told us that it was still a problem with Comcast.  The young man said she didn't know what she was talking about etc. and that I should have a technician from the alarm company come out.  I did this, and the young man promptly took off. After a long rainstorm, I went into the backyard and found the phone line access box open with a mass of wires drooping down the side of the house, which I placed in the box as best as I could and closed the panel.  I then went to log onto the internet to attend my online college courses, only to find that I had no internet!  Then, when I picked up the phone, I found I had no phone access!  I called Comcast on my cell, only to be given attitude.  After some discussion, I was told it would be escalated to a supervisor who would call me within the hour.  24 hours later, since I had received no phone call, I called Comcast again and went through the whole explanation, only to be offered another visit from the technician in two days time.  The only times offered were working hours.  So, my wife is taking time off of work to meet the technician again.  This caused loss of class time, which will result in at least one letter grade in one class.  And this caused loss of leave time used to meet with technicians.  Also, this caused months of loss of security for a disabled alarm system."
1,"It is this bouncing of internet speeds that limits the Internets usefulness. I start streaming a movie then because of speed issues, it either downgrades signal or stops playing. They know I have an issue b/c they can see my ping speeds are excessive it is the fixing I can't get taken care of."
1,"Well, let's just say Comcast keeps reeling me back in and I never learn my lesson! In April 2010, I was solicited by a sales rep for Comcast regarding their service. We decided on a 7-room installment, internet and phone. He stated that my bill would be anywhere from $170.00-180.00/month. Since I was moving, he guaranteed me next-day installation at my new home.I was shocked to see the technician arrive at my home. He was there for 6 hours. He completed 4 of the rooms and only hooked up 2 phone jacks and the internet. He stated that he could not complete the installation, because he would have to drill holes on the outside of my house to get the cable installed in the remaining rooms. He then stated that he would return to finish the room. Well, if anyone has ever moved before, you know that cable is the last thing on your mind. We never received our first bill (so darn typical of Comcast). Then we were surprised to see a bill in May for over $400.00. So my husband decided to contact Comcast, and as usual, if you owe a balance, you can't get through. Finally in June, we were able to get through, thanks to a friend who works for Comcast. My husband spoke with a young man by the name of Stefan who guaranteed that we would receive some type of compensation for the inconvenience of only having 4 rooms installed and for the phone. Well, my husband was so happy for him being so understanding. He stated, ""Don't worry about the phone issue; we can live with only having phone usage in 2 rooms."" What a wrong thing to do! Stefan also guaranteed that a tech would be by that Saturday to finish the installation (which happened 2 months later!) and that we will receive a new bill with the credits. Although my husband had not wanted to pay a thing until it was corrected, he paid 1/2 of the bill. His philosophy: 1/2 the payment for 1/2 the work! So as promised, a technician was out to complete the job (and he didn't have to drill outside!). This was on 6/12/10. Well, needless to say, it is now 6/28; and we have no phone or cable. And God only knows when the internet will go down. So we contacted Comcast and spoke with Josie who stated that there was no record of the credits (Go figure!) and that she would need to email Stefan to find out what type of credit he was going to issue! (So we were to wait all over again!) So I decided not to wait. I immediately called back and spoke with Roz and asked for a supervisor or manager; she refused to patch me through. She said that she needed to get info from me. Needless to say, I never spoke with a supervisor. I explained my situation to her, and she stated, ""Well, on 4/19, we credited your account $79.50 for the installation."" There wasn't supposed to be a charge for the installation! And she said that the most she could do was credit the remaining $51.95 for the installation. Again, there wasn't supposed to be an installation fee! And that is not good enough! We have gone 2 1/2 months without the proper installation. She then stated that she couldn't do anything else because we were only charged for the package and the 2 HD boxes. But hold on, our package was for a 7-room installation! What in the world! So needless to say, after speaking with Roz, she transferred me to Jennifer in collections who started by saying that we were not getting another credit for anything else, even after I explained our situation. She said that we needed to make up our mind as to what we were going to do because our account was in the red and that we haven't made a payment since we started the services. What?! I was furious by this time and stated that my husband paid over $200.00 with Stephan via a debit card. She looked and saw the payment and said, ""Still you need to pay the $208.00 before your services will be turned back on and you need to decide what you are going to do!"" What kinda customer services does Comcast think they are providing?! Since they basically cornered the market in my area, we are pretty much stuck with them! Comcast needs to remember that it is customers like me who provide them the money to pay their bills, not the CEO. Without the customer, you would not have a job!"
1,"A salesman offered me a great triple play deal. Installation was marred by requiring 3 visits with 3 no shows. There were hidden costs not revealed by sales person. Despite many calls to customer service, they would not give the Internet service that was promised. I have an extremely slow internet connection."
1,"Comcast deceived me with their promo product packages. This company do not honor what they offer. This is deception. Comcast just increased my bill with not warning or notices at all. When I called them up to complain about the promotion offered to me, Comcast told me that I cannot get into any promotion anymore, that I have to pay $164.99 as per my bill. I downgraded my service on June 5, 2010 because I refused to pay Comcast anymore money. Now when the downgrade happened in June 5, 2010, I've been having problem with my cable service and my internet service. At night like 11:00PM, when I would turn on my TV to watch the news, I would find no service.When I take my online classes, my internet service would get turned off. Do you see what happens if Comcast cannot suck anymore money from you? The staff would play with my cable/internet services. All what I can do is to devote my time to call a technician and they would relate to you their bible studies of reasons why I do not have cable/internet services. Comcast deceives you and makes fun of your services if they cannot suck any more money from you. Is there a law to prohibit from this kind of business practice? Please help. Thanks."
1,"When I see online complaints about companies, I am sometimes suspicious the complaints have been posted by competitors. So for the record, I'd like to state that I am in no way connected with the ISP world. I'm just a frustrated internet user who is paying Comcast for the purported reliability of 24/7 ISP/phone service, but am plagued with extended service interruptions. We are located between **.During the last 2 weeks, our Comcast internet and telephone service has 6 times gone out for 1-3 hours, usually in the early morning, 4-7 am period. Our cable TV service is not interrupted. When this happens, we call Comcast and they verify that the modem is off line. They sent out a service technician who replaced our modem but that did not resolve the problem. Reportedly, Comcast has scheduled a line service check (to take place sometime in the next 10-14 days!). They have issued a whopping $6 refund, to compensate us for approximately 20 hours accumulated service outages. To appreciate our frustration you should be aware that this is not an isolated instance. A similar spate of service interruptions took place about 6 months ago and about 6 months before that and about 6 months before that.When this happened a year ago, Comcast reran the line from the pole to our house. When it happened 6 months ago, the line-check rep found a cable box at the pole on our neighbor's property, that had been improperly reassembled and was filled with water. When it happened 18 months ago, the line-check rep said lines in our area are old, run through water pockets and need to be rerun. That ""jives"" with our observation that most service interruptions take place when it's raining or morning dew is heavy. We rarely have an outage on a bright sunny day.Ours is not a large residential area. The number of people effected might be few, but maybe not. If you're experiencing Comcast ISP outages in the **, weigh in here, maybe if enough of us complain, Comcast will fix it."
1,"I called Tech support to make sure their website was compatible with my Mac 10.3.9 & was told by Mellisa that indeed it was. So it was installed last Friday. 2 hrs. later, I could not get to their email site as I got error message that I needed 10.4 to continue. I cannot update my computer; so now, I can't send emails. They had to replace the modem as I was not getting any internet nor mail. Now they've threatened to charge me 2 visits. As a new customer, they quoted me $101.77 which after it was installed, I paid $171.26 & I was to get credit for the over charges. Well, today it yet went up again, to $129.76 & that it will now be $171.26 the following month?! They hung up on me."
1,"In mid March, I obtained service from Comcast for internet services only. The installer gave me the wrong information, about what kind of modem I needed to use DOCSIS3 speeds, and the modem models on their website, and with customer service also gave the wrong information. A ""clerical"" error kept me at the lower rate, so I wasn't losing too much in bandwidth. When my April/May bill came out, the floods came to Nashville. I called the auto information line, and it said there was an outage in our area. The only thing is all the other families in my building with Comcast had no outage for the 6 days I experienced one.Two techs were sent out, who fixed my DOCSIS3 modem issue, and made sure I was on the proper billing tier, took about 2 hours to fiddle with their box on the well to get my connection up to snuff, as best as they could. Because some flood issues further upstream, were causing minor radio noise on the lines. Okay, I can accept that it will be fixed, as things get back to normal. But these techs blew out 4 other families' cable connections in the building, while ""fixing"" mine. Now, it took me 6 days to get assistance.Somehow, these 4 families got a tech out the next day, to fix their cable/internet and degraded my line to the point that, by 1.5 days later, their internet analyst, Ana, did something on her end, and I lost all connection. Until then, just my download speeds were being affected, and not my upload. I did a back trace route, and reported the server that was between my house and modem, was not responding. There was nothing, just hours and hours of aggravation. I was told that it would be 3 days before a tech could come out. I understand, that in normal circumstances, their SLAS are 24 hours or less. They refused to respond.The tech did not show up on Tuesday or Wednesday, but I found a call tag on my door, after I just got home from dropping off their modem to a ""counter location"". The address in the phone books is some locked down secretary spot. She stated people always come here. I said it's the address in the phone book for all local Comcast listings. She gave me a ""map"", of how to get to a counter location. I paid these jokers $250 for a tech who didn't do the install correctly at $40. I was out for 10 days with no service. They ""refunded"" my first set of outage days. I'm awaiting my bill for the second. The headaches from using their ""internet"" service, and talking with an analyst, only to be ""hung up on"", after being told ""you need to call this"" and  ""I can't help you"". I got their ""advertised"" speeds on their network, try speedtest.comcast.net, but not on the internet, because of latency/resistance. Try just speedtest.net. This is how the ""claim"" of speeds is determined. So the first speed test is only on their network. The second is the true internet. They totally have a sweet monopoly in this town. No other cable companies are allowed. However, out of this metropolitan area, they have competition. I've lost time, and gotten half baked results. I was charged for things that I did not get service on. It was a total waste."
1,"I have had difficulties with my internet for over a year. Comcast had laid new lines and since then, I've been constantly being dropped from the internet. I thought my problems were within my own home since my computer is old. Someone told me to call Comcast to see if the problems were external. I have been calling since March 2010 and have records of each call. They confirmed that the problem is outside and have repeatedly told me that they would have maintenance come out and boost the signal. To date, this still has not been resolved. I need help. I am constantly being disconnected. I am so frustrated with their poor service and promises of resolving this issue and not doing so. I am unemployed and have been for some time. My internet access is critical in my job search. I am not seeking employment outside of my area and this service is my only way of checking and applying for employment outside of my vicinity."
1,"Over past 1-2 months, internet connectivity is extremely slow in the evening, some times unable to have websites load completely. In the morning, it is not a problem. "
1,"Comcast has employed needless, stupid operating-system specific limitations on their Internet service. They support only three operating systems--two windows and one mac. Since there are over 150 computer operating systems in the world, including some very commonly used only like Unix and Linux, this makes no sense. Since network packets are operating system generic, there is no reason to impose limitations like this. I don't know of any other Internet vendor who does this."
1,"My son lived with me after coming home from the navy and he didn’t like my dial up internet connection. He offered to get high speed in his name and he would pay the bill, so he did. Now my son no longer lives here so I tried to get service in my name. Comcast says that I will have to pay his outstanding bill, which he has refused to pay because he says the company actually owes him a refund. Now I am being held responsible for his bill and cannot get service or my rebate for equipment purchased for $100.00 unless I pay his bill up to date. Is this even legal? Am I now an unpaid employee for Comcast as a debt collector? Can I now legally send Comcast a bill for services rendered? This is not the complete story. I’ve shortened it considerably. I’m just sick of the whole mess. This has been going on now for about 11 weeks. I just want it to end."
1,"We have been having trouble with our internet for over a year. The connections keep getting disconnected. We have called and spent over anywhere from 4hrs to 8hrs with a tech trying to help. We have continued to ask from a technician to be sent to the house. We are told that someone will have to call us back because they can't schedule the appointment. The last time we were trying to get a repair person to come to the house, we spent all day over 8 hrs. The cell phone battery went dead (The Call started with a full batteries), then had to change over another phone.The tech. we talked to finally agreed, that it was not just the wireless and that even with a direct connection to the computer we were loosing connection. But the best he could do even after being on the phone and on hold, he could not schedule an appointment and would have to have someone call us. We still are losing connection and no one is calling and we can't get anyone to come out. Why do we stay with them? Because that is our only option. We have to call AT&T and were told that they are not fast in our area yet but would let us know when. We have missed important information. This is very aggravating. A friend who is staying with us is unable to get work information. "
1,"What has not happened with this company? The speed advertised is not even close to what you get. When you do get a decent speed it is only burst speed soon to fade away. They complicate any and everything imaginable for a home network. I had to call them to unblock it the day it was set up, amazing. They lied about the free netbook for signing up. I signed up and they say I never signed a contract I never received so I said I will cancel your service then. The verbal contract says I will pay a fee or get submitted to the credit agencies. They have no Quality Assurance Team. The employees are arrogant and my service will probably glitch before I click submit. They definitely let you know customer service isn't needed in every industry! I hate you Comcast!"
1,Trying to use the Comcast high speed internet self install program has been one of the frustrating things I have done in many years. I have gotten into the system but cannot use the email either to send or receive any message except ones I do not want. Their is no anti spam program in this boondogle that I am able to find. I was told by the local agent that I would be able to bring my email address book from outlook express to this account and I now find that is impossible to do. A customer service rep from Orlando attempted to help me but she gave up also and said it was a problem with Outlook express. I seriously doubt that since outlook express worked very well until I made the mistake of transferring to Comcast high speed internet service. This problem must have an answer and I would appreciate knowing what it is. 
1,"I am a small business owner started an office in Ashland VA in Feb 2010. I opted to go with Comcast Internet and phone line. Comcast has published my line to the world and it interrupts my work terribly. Poor phone quality and annoying incoming is giving more headache than I wanted. So I called up Comcast to request to discontinue phone line with Comcast. Ms. Susan from Comcast said, I had signed a three year contract with Comcast and I just completed one month trial period and a cancellation would result in fee over thousand dollars. Apparently, the exit clause is paying off 70 percent of the future fees to Comcast.Is this one sided contract valid? It is causing significant productivity loss with unwanted phone calls. "
1,My account has been suspended by Comcast for bandwdith violation. I use legally peer 2 peer file sharing.
1,"I called to see why I could not get on 90% of the websites I wanted to get on. They insisted that it was not Comcast's fault. So for about month, I could only get about 3 or 4 websites. Every time I got on the internet, Comcast site would pop up and would not allow me to get on the website I wanted to get on. I asked my son if he could fix it. He called Comcast and they told him it was a problem on their end. So after being charged for an internet service I could not use for over a month, I feel my account should get a credit."
1,"I received a very threatening call from Comcast a few weeks ago in which the man calling told me that (in my 20 years with this company) I went over my (unknown) bandwidth limit in January. He was very stern, intending to be threatening and told me if I ""ever do it again"", they will turn off my internet for 1 year! I asked if they would tell me when I was approaching this ""limit"" and he said they would not!! I asked if I could pay for more bandwidth and he responded that I could not! This after just once going over a limit I didn't even know I had and have no way of measuring. We had been watching movies on Netflix streaming and I totally believe that of course, they know that and they are threatening customers who are using the competition to watch movies. This really is monopolistic! Please help as I must have email for work."
1,"We moved to Sacramento in August 2009 and have had a series of problems with Comcast. First, they promised a ""free netbook"" computer with the package we purchased. After months of phone calls verifying that we would receive the netbook, I called again only to be told that we were no longer eligible because they had not received the appropriate form from us in time. I explained that I had faxed the agreement in early September and in fact had called them in October, November and December asking about the status. While this is a small matter, as a consumer it does not bode well if Comcast is purchasing interest in a television network. I am used to dealing with companies that operate with integrity. Comcast does not care about the consumer!Our most recent adventure is with a problem in service. They sent someone out and verified before the visit that there would be no charge. Upon receiving the bill, we were charged $27.99 for the visit and had to spend 30 minutes dealing with several people to get the charges reversed. I just want our netbook. Ideally, we would be allowed to drop the service and try something else but we have a contract."
1,"I signed up for high speed internet. It is supposed to be 12mbps down and 4mbps up. I'm not seeing those numbers on a consistent basis. In fact, when I am downloading a file from the internet or email, everyone else in my house can download at no more than about 200kbs. It appears as though Comcast is throttling bandwidth when files are being downloaded. In addition, downloading speeds hover around 500kb/s most of the time, not even close to the advertised 12mbps. I feel that Comcast has misrepresented their product and I will probably demand my money back. This is very very disappointing. I am losing time and money, product not as advertised."
1,"We pay almost $150 per month for service which includes internet!  We constantly have email issues due to Comcast IP issues.  They try to filter spam so our outbound email always gets bounced back.  I have spent at least 20 hours on the phone and internet trying to fix it and it keeps coming back.  They are our only choice, so they feel they can stick it to us as we have no choice.  The worst thing is they never notify you of issues and just do what they want.  Then when you call for help, they say someone will call you back and they usually don’t."
1,"I am experiencing a similar problem as Richard from Fair Oaks. Intermittent Internet and digital phone service, digital TV service unaffected. The first level of support is as with most organizations, not very skilled. If you can't correct it with the set of instruction, they are provided to give to you; they simply want to schedule a very inconvenient home visit. I am a systems administrator, thus fairly technically competent and though I do not have access to prove it, the issue points to a server problem. I am on call 24/7. Most emergency issues I can handle remotely, if I have a reliable Internet connection. My Comcast connection is far from reliable. If an after hours emergency occurs, I need to drive onto campus and correct it."
1,"I called Comcast on 1/6/10, 1/8/10, 1/9/10, and a few more times after that. I reported that the internet was not working. Having had this problem before, I reset my modem per the Comcast instructions many times; but still no internet. It's funny how during this outage, my television service still worked correctly, but I only received intermittent service on my internet. Once again, I called to report that the problem was still occurring intermittently. I explained to them that one of their techs had been here and that he checked the modem and the wiring and there was nothing wrong with them (at least that is what he told me). They insisted they would have to send someone out again. I responded that I felt it was unnecessary, but if you do, I don't want to be charged.They sent out another technician who agreed with me that it appears to be a problem at either their server or one of their nodes. Additionally, he informed me that some of my other neighbors approached him and reported to him that they were experiencing outages also. Within 24 to 48 hours after his visit, the internet service was working without any intermittent outages and has since worked extremely well.In my opinion, what Comcast has done is borderline illegal. If I were a lawyer and had the wherewithal to investigate this issue, I'm sure I'd find that in this instance, there was a problem either at the server or node as the technician had stated. However, Comcast will not even investigate my complaint. They won't let me talk to anyone higher than a supervisor. I asked the supervisor and the call center rep to provide me with the history of my calls and the notes taken. Although they did note that there was an outage, they refused to waive the fee they had charged me, supposedly because the technician stated in his notes that the resolution could have been handled over the phone. Therefore, according to the call center reps, the customer will pay for the service call (that I didn't want)."
1,"Comcast internet installer lied to me, conned me into high-speed internet connection. It was good for a certain period of time under an introductory offer. He told me when the introductory offer ended, I would need to call Comcast and have another technician come out to disconnect the high-speed internet connection and that I would have to pay for the service call. I called Comcast customer service, they said that was not true. I believe Comcast in Denver is extorting customers. I am on unemployment and I need my computer to look for jobs online. This type of coercion is nothing more than an act of a bunch of thugs who have hijacked the Denver internet community."
1,"I had Comcast cable installed in September of 2008 for TV and internet. The cable installer needed to install an M-card into my TiVo for it to work with their system. The first card the installer tried did not work, however, the tech wrote that number on my work order before testing that. He then took that card out and put a second card in its place and lightly crossed out the first number on the work order. Jump forward 6 months. I start getting a $50 unreturned equipment charge on my bill for the first card (the one I never received). I called and they said, ""okay, we'll do an inventory check and get back to you. Meanwhile, don't pay that portion of your bill"". They never got back to me. I had to go through it all again the next month and the next. Getting angry, I asked that they do something about this. So they agreed to send a tech out to my house to physically check my equipment. Fine by me. The tech came out, understood my situation, made a call and the charge isn't on my next bill. Yeah! Success. Oh wait, jump forward another 6 months. I got a mysterious phone call from ""Comcast equipment recovery group"" or some such. They want to know about a cable card I still have that they want back (with the original serial number from the one I never got). I explained the whole story from above and the guy said, ""OK, thank you"" and assured me when I asked that it isn't an issue. Next bill, $30 unreturned equipment charge on my bill again (strangely the equipment now costs less). I did my duty and called Comcast to inquire (also about why my bill is nearly twice the previous month). Oh, that's because you must pay full price now and there are no incentives to keep you anymore"". I cancelled the TV portion, but they said my internet cost will go to $70/month without the TV part so I ended up paying for basic $15 which makes my bill less than $70, but not by much. By the way, Basic TV I already got over the antenna with better quality. So I'm paying for service I don't need or use now just to keep my internet. Anyway, on with the story. So they say, ""our records show you have a card that belongs to us"". I say, ""yeah, the one I'm using"". They say ""no, the other one"". I say ""what other one?"". They say ""okay, we'll check our inventory to see if we can find it. If we don't, you will owe us. Meanwhile, ignore the $30 portion of your bill"". Now, they will never find that card. I'm sure it was lost by the installer and will never see the light of day again. Now, I'm back to where I started a year ago (oh yeah, but for $20 less now).This is the way a new customer has been treated. This company may not be a monopoly by the pure definition, but it acts like one. They even told me I should get my internet somewhere else if I don't like their prices. OK then. I have already contracted for DSL at 1/3 the price for about 1/2 the BW (that is the most I can get, so yes Comcast has a monopoly on any speed higher). I'm looking forward to calling and cancelling my account as soon as the DSL goes live. I'm not looking forward to the runaround I'm facing about the phantom cable card I supposedly have. Like I'd want an inactive cable card. Like it would have any value to me at all.Did I mention that I was supposed to get a ""free"" cable box with my original order, but since I opted for the smaller, cheaper cable card only I had to pay $2/month for that? I hate Comcast. I only ordered because I was offered a reasonable rate. I always said when the rates go up, I'm gone. Evil, evil company. Yes, every argument comes to this. Evil like Nazi evil. You know what word is the most sarcastic way ever devised to say ""fantastic""? You guessed it. ""Comcastic"". I said that to a customer service rep in a joking way and was told that they would hang up on me if I kept using abusive language. I had to mute my phone so they wouldn't be offended by my hysterical laughing."
1,"Upon moving into my new residence, I contacted Comcast to connect my internet services to my new home. Coming from an area which Comcast has competition, which here there is none via wires of any kind, I notice a very slow speed when downloading simple drivers for a printer. I tested the speed via a couple of websites including Comcast's speed test site and found that at times, the download speed was running at dial up specs. I sent them a copy of the speed tests and also reminded them that there is a competitor gearing up to provide service in my area. I also stated that with this happening, they should make sure that their services were running at tip top shape. Within a day, the speeds, download and upload increased dramatically. It stayed that way for a couple of months. They always want to ""suggest"" it is the complaining party's equipment. Even their website targets the consumer's equipment and doesn't even suggest that their lines are not performing. Even when I talked to them, the same thing and wanted to charge for a service call. My brother is an IT guy who provided me with the internet speed test sites to keep an online log. Well, my service tanked again. It will not even come close to support VOIP service. You would think that with Comcast's own speed test site, they would have it set up to ""flag"" when somebody does these tests which shows a degradation of service. But no! I dread having to deal with again. There again lies lack of innovation on their part. Why because more times then not, they don't have to. Lack of competition. One of the biggest problems with Comcast is that in some areas, smaller cities and towns, they don't have competition which a family or a business is stuck with them if they want anything other than wireless internet via cell phone or satellite --which is pricey. In these same areas, even their CATV is pricey as well. They have a captive consumer group. Well as soon as I get notification that this new company is good to go, so am I. "
1,"I did a credit report recently and found a collection from Columbia House for $198.94. I questioned that on the form and then received a notice from National Credit Solutions. I have not ordered from Columbia House. I never received anything. The NCS account person (Elizabeth) was extremely rude and wouldn't discuss it other than to say I needed to make a payment. She suggested that going to arbitration would take a long time, while paying it would be simpler. This is a fraud. From where I don't know."
1,I am using a free wireless internet service. Comcast is blocking this service with a page that wants you to sign up with their service and will not let you leave the page.
1,"Recently, my email account, along with all data contained therein, was deleted without any notification. This occurred on a current account with an excellent payment history. It is truly remarkable that any service provider would delete the email account of a paying customer and then refuse to restore the data. Within my account, I had ongoing correspondences with my mortgage provider, with contractors who are being paid thousands of dollars to renovate my home, with other service providers, and I had information about upcoming travel plans. Remarkable.My understanding is, this occurred basically because Comcast employees working the phone lines are not equipped to handle anything unusual, however basic. In my case, I asked for an additional service to be provided at a new address. So, I was paying Comcast twice for service at two addresses. Apparently, despite my insistence that this was not a transfer order, and despite additional instructions from the Comcast employee who performed the installation service at my home that this was not a transfer order, the new account was initiated as a transfer from my previous address. Immediately after initiating my new service, the service at my old address was terminated. When I complained, a new account apparently was started at my old address, but my email address and data were missing.I will spare the other embarrassing details of customer service, such as the deletion of another email account of mine at the new address prior to the creation of an account that was a misspelling of my name. I won't even mention the messages left on my voice mail about ""the new tenant"" who wanted to move into my newly purchased house. I complained enough to get a work order to fix this problem and reactivate my email account with all its data. Nothing ever happens on this work order, but when I call to inquire, I am assured that this is still an ""open job."" I think it will always be an ""open job"" where nothing happens."
1,Comcast high-speed Internet is not high speed. It takes 1 minute to load 6MB - that is 0.1mps not the 20mps that is advertised. Nobody at Comcast can help. Save your money and get DSL.
1,"On Friday, October 2nd, I contacted Comcast on the phone to inquire about upgrading my internet service from my existing speed to the 50 Mb/second service. For those that do not know, this requires a cable modem that is DOCSIS 3.0 compliant. My existing cable modem is not DOCSIS 3.0 compliant, so I knew I needed a new cable modem. I am fully capable of installing equipment and getting line check information. I asked the Comcast representative on the phone what was required, and her initial response was that my service area was not upgraded to 50 Mb/second speeds. I informed her that it was as I knew someone in the area that had the service. She said she had to check and would call back.Five minutes later she called back and confirmed that, indeed, the service was available. She also informed me that it would cost $99/month; it would require renting a modem from Comcast at a monthly fee, and would require a $29.95 installation charge. I told her that I didn't want to pay $29.95 for someone to come in and disconnect my existing modem and hook up a new one as I could do that. She refused to waive the charge, and I told her that would cost Comcast $99/month of lost revenue. Researching on Comcast's website showed that the service fee was either $9.95 or $99.95 to connect to the 50 Mb/second service. I have no idea where the $29.95 fee came from. Later on that same day I made a post on Comcast's forums detailing my phone call experience. George, from Comcast, read the message and responded immediately that he would help.On Saturday, with George's suggestion, I had purchased the required modem and emailed George the MAC address. By Monday morning George had done a line test (remotely), I hooked up the new modem, and George provisioned it (remotely). By 10:30am on Monday I was running at the increased speeds with no installation fee. So, it appears that Comcast does have representatives that go that extra mile to make things right. I can understand the fees for those that are not able to do the installations. However, Comcast should be able to work with their customers to get them the service they want without unnecessary fees when those customers can do without a representative coming to the house."
1,"I have internet service but do not have the ability to access my e-mail account, this has been for over 24 hours."
1,"While ordering high-speed internet, the CSR said if I ordered the Triple Play (phone, TV, internet), there would be no installation charge. I asked if there was a penalty for canceling early due to a move etc. She said no, that it was month to month. Great! I later got an email to ""agree"" to the term commitment, that there is a $150 charge for canceling early. Also, I got my first bill with $175 additional charges - installation, line install, new connection! I went to their site and emailed them about this. No response. Then I chatted live with a CSR who kept saying, “Sorry, you must understand that if there is an installation, there really are installation charges.” I asked for a manager. She said she couldn't do anything. I asked, “Who could?” She replied that she would submit a credit request and look into this. I asked her when I would hear back. Answer was 48 to 72 hours. We'll see what happens but I have a feeling I’ll have to call back. Also, invoice is confusing."
1,"I had Comcast Internet service last year. It was cancelled a year ago while keeping the cable connection. After that, my spouse tried to get the service through discount offer program but Comcast refused to provide it. Now a year later, I ordered it again through broadbandoffers.com. However, when I called Comcast for the cable installation, they started putting me through one representative after another. Each of them would give different information and push me to pay extra for installation for each service. Some nonsense lady even started saying that they upgrade the system every month and wires have to be changed to get the signal. In other words, I have to buy extra package of wires from one of their locations.One of the representatives told me that she could see in the system that I had Comcast cable service 9 months ago. Another representative said that I had an appointment scheduled on August 15th, quite surprising because I ordered my service only on the 21st of August! Then, at last, another moron lady came with attitude and said that she can't see any order even though I gave her the confirmation number. She asked me to put a new order directly with Comcast , of course, at higher rate. Looks like they have tagged my address - and every time I call them, they start behaving differently after I give them my address and phone number. Looks like they have my details tagged for some reason and are discriminating even though I qualify all the terms and conditions to get a new connection."
1,"Comedy of errors is what happened. On August 23, I called Comcast to ask why an extra $130(!) was on our bill. After waiting 14 minutes(!) for a customer service rep to answer, she agreed that charges should not have been there. In the midst of our call, my phone and internet service went dead. Now, my blood pressure’s rising. I called from my cell phone, and got a kid named Aaron, who said his employee # was ** on the phone. I'd asked for a supervisor and he said he was one ""sort of"". I told him I want a billing supervisor and he said there's no billing supervisor but that he can work with my bill. Our ""conversation"" was a one-sided monologue, not allowing a word in, despite two of us raising our voices for him at this point to please stop talking. It appeared on our end he was medicated. That was, until he said, ""I see your separate charge for the Internet and I don't know why that's there.” I said, “Neither do we, and that's why we're calling you.” Silence.I said, ""Hello?"" and he said, ""I'm confused. What do you want me to do?"" Our jaws were on the floor. I reminded him it was his job to look into the charges, and find out why they were there, and to remove them. He said, “I can't tell if they're supposed to be there or not.” It was absurd. When I collected my emotions a bit later, I called and got a genuine supervisor on the phone named Phil. He not only explained the error on Comcast's end, but removed the charges. But, I still had the problem of having no phone/internet. So after I was done with Phil, he transferred me to tech service. That call too got disconnected (from my cell). When I did get through, a guy named Carlos told me I need to have a service tech come out. We just had a service tech here 2 weeks ago to replace faulty equipment we rent from Comcast. I told him I couldn't make the appointment tonight because we weren't going to be around. He made it anyway, I discovered. Worse (or better) yet, the service miraculously came back tonight. Our neighbors, as well as us, are fed up with Comcast and are looking into Verizon FiOS. Anyone else here make the switch? Happy?"
1,"We moved here in June 2009 and have the Comcast TV/Internet/telephone subscription package. Every day since the installation, we have had loss of connection to the Internet and telephone. This happens at least a dozen times a day. There are moments where I can stay connected to the Internet 1 minute at max, and this happens multiple times in a row. We have had Comcast at least 8 times here to repair the problem, and guess what, it still isn't fixed. A Comcast ""repair"" man was here this week and said he can't fix the problem because the problem is outside and he is only an indoor technician. A couple of days later, a Comcast outdoor technician came here and said the problem is inside and he can't fix it because he is an outdoor technician.Today, a line technician was supposed to repair the problem. Three repairmen in 5 days and still no resolution. This is a complete joke. If there were another cable and Internet provider in the area, we would subscribe with them. But we can't do so because Comcast is a monopoly company. We have to have Comcast call us on our mother-in-law's phone because ours isn't reliable - and I use our home phone to run a business. Comcast is a disgrace. Each technician that is here seems to try to set a record of how fast they can get in and out without solving the problem. I sent Comcast an angry email yesterday and the ""executive"" called today and said that they are upgrading it to a major problem. No **, 2 months later, it is still a problem. If you have an alternative, then don't even think about subscribing with Comcast!"
1,"Every afternoon, Comcast high-speed internet slows to a crawl. There are always problems with email. Is there anyone who knows of a better alternative?"
1,"We are extremely frustrated with Comcast and feel like they are abusing the customer for being the only provider in the Arlington area. I scheduled an appointment for July 18th from 5 to 8PM to install the service. The technician never came and I called the customer service, which was not helpful at all. They said that the technician called and did not even leave a message or anything. He did not even come to my apartment. I was waiting at the lobby and no one came from 4:30 to 9:00PM (appointment from 5 to 8:00PM). How do I know if they really came? I left work early, I was at home at 4:30PM. I called customer service. It was 6:30PM, still in the window time for them to come but they said they will not come. I canceled the installation after talking to your Comcast customer service and finding no solutions. Then, I tried again and they told me I needed to open a new account. Surprise, now instead of $29.99, I would have to pay $59.99! Way to go after waiting for more than 3 hours (it was already around 8:30PM), I got higher prices for the same service. I decided to try something else, but again, they are the only provider. Then last week, August 14, 2009, I tried again. I found the same price as before, $29.99 special, and the salesperson put on hold for several minutes. She apologized and gave a really good deal for my area. She said that the technician will come today (08/19/09) between 8 and 11AM. It is 9:00AM and we called before 9:00AM. The customer service agent told us that there is no appointment scheduled for today! My wife took the day off for this today. She is really frustrated that she has to lose one day of work and then Comcast's only answer is ""Man, there is nothing we can do. You need to reschedule."" I don't know too much about Comcast business, but I don't think they are doing that great to treat people like this. It is abusive, unfair and disrespectful."
1,"We have had Comcast cable, Internet and phone service for the last few years. We have had many many technicians out here to fix the problems. Guess what? We are still having problems. As I type this, I am on hold with Comcast right now on my cell phone. We have no service that stays on. It keeps going off and on, up and down, whatever you want to call it.I have a very ill husband, a daughter with online college classes, and she is getting behind on those. I made a payment by check and Comcast took 2 payments out of my checking account and paid someone else's bill. I have used many minutes on my cell phone. I spoke with supervisors today and still, nothing gained. I had to cancel an appointment today because of waiting and being constantly put on hold on the phone. And the topper of it all, they tell me they can only give us 2 weeks of credit! What a joke! And I have to deal with the bank myself. That is a bunch of **!Now, what is going to be done about this? I am contacting the Attorney General's office, the Better Business Bureau, writing a letter to the St. Paul Pioneer Press, the Minneapolis Tribune and smaller surrounding towns newspapers. I will go on the Internet and find as many places as I can to complain about this. I want to be reimbursed for everything that we have gone through all because of your company. Please feel free to call me at ** but be aware that I may be very irate with you. The phone may not even work if our Comcast is down!"
1,"I have been talking with Comcast reps for almost two weeks now. I have them as my service with phone, internet, and TV. Now, due to financial problems, I can't pay the bill, so I wanted to cancel the service because it has only been 3 1/3 months and one month of 30-day cancel of service. I have nothing but problems with the service since they installed it. They have been nothing but nasty and get annoyed when I speak with them. They said that to cancel the service it will cost me $8,000. This is crazy. Please help me. Thanks. "
1,"I moved into a basement apartment in a row house and needed to set up internet. I contacted Comcast as there was still equipment in the basement from Comcast from the last resident. They were initially unable to understand that it was a basement apartment in a private home, not an apartment building. After putting me on hold repeatedly, they told me to ask my landlord if I could be part of their account. I did and my landlord prefers separate accounts as the apartment is completely separate. I called Comcast back and it took half an hour to explain to Pontsho (who did genuinely try to help me, but had to continually put me on hold to ask her supervisor) that I live in a basement apartment and need to just reactivate the same service that someone else had been using for the last year. Finally, they told me the only way that they could recognize a separate apartment at the same physical address was if I faxed over a copy of something that had been mailed to me so that they could see that the post office accepted the address. It was Friday and I couldn't fax until Monday, so I had to wait. In the meantime, Pontsho even called me back to check the progress of faxing, as she did want to help me and was making a real effort.Monday, I faxed several bills, etc., that showed my address as accepted by the post office. I called 4 hours later, as they had not contacted me, and had to explain the entire situation over again to Neil. He again told me that they no longer offer separate accounts at the same physical address, to which I replied that that was why Comcast had requested that I fax the information. After being put on hold repeatedly and told the same thing over and over, I told Neil that I wanted to speak with a supervisor. He tried to convince me not to, but I insisted. He put me on hold several more times, then told me that all the supervisors were busy and that if I wanted to talk to one, I could get a ""ticket number"" and they would call me back by the end of the day. It was 8:15 pm. If they had not been able to give me any service, they should have told me immediately. Apparently, no one knows what their true policies are and there is no consistency. Every time I have tried to get Comcast in the past, there have been similar issues. I will not be a Comcast customer again."
1,"I relocated about 1 month ago, and since I relocated, I had a nightmare experience with Comcast. I have all my services with them: phone, internet, and cable services. For 4 days, I had no services at all. I had technicians four times at my house and for each visit, I lost a day of work and income. Then they connect the cable, and it takes 3 weeks to make it work for a day. But this time, I lost all my e-mail accounts with saved mail, address book, and all valuable memories. And for 6 days, I couldn't send or receive e-mail. Now they created a new account for me. However, I lost all the data I had saved in Comcast. This is a nightmare."
1,"My internet service went out on June 28. It came back on briefly June 29. I called and reported it on June 30. I have a home office and I was unable to work without internet. I was told that Comcast could not come out until July 2. Comcast came out, reviewed the wiring in my house, and said that the problem was up at the street at the pole. The technician told me that he would report the problem and someone would be out that afternoon to fix it. The next morning, July 3, I still had no service. I called and I was told that no one was scheduled to come out and that they couldn't come out until later that week. I paid the man to help me because I have a home office and couldn't work. He found someone to come out between 1pm and 5pm on July 3.I waited and called Comcast on 5/4/30 and was told that they would still be there by five o'clock. At 5:40pm, I called Comcast and I was told they couldn't get there until 6:45pm. I was very upset because July 3 was a holiday and my day off from work and I had spent it waiting for Comcast to show up. I asked them to come Saturday morning at 10am instead. Comcast came on July 4 and fixed the internet up at the street. I called Comcast today to complain about the service I had received. I was told that they would give me a credit of $10.71 for my loss of internet service for the week. I asked to speak to this person's manager.After being put on hold for 20 minutes, Christine ** came on the line. She told me that she could give me $10.71 of credit for internet service. When I said that was not enough for the pain and suffering, loss of income and various inconveniences of spending hours and hours of time on the phone, she said she would give me a credit of $27.99 for one of the service calls. I was shocked. I asked her if she meant that I had to pay for these service calls of Comcast coming out to fix their equipment. She said, yes, I had been charged for two service calls at $27.99 each and she was willing to give me a credit for one of them.When I insisted that was not adequate, she agreed to credit me for both service calls because it was Comcast equipment that was at fault. I lost a week's worth of work and hours of time dealing with Comcast. They made no effort to compensate me for my time, energy, and loss of income. They were unfriendly, uncooperative, and unwilling to offer decent, honest service. I believe they should have serviced their equipment immediately the day I called. And if they couldn't do it, they should have called me and let me know that they can't make it on time."
1,"I only purchased high-speed internet through Comcast, but decided to bundle with another company. They cancelled the account and mailed a box to me so that I could return the modem. The box did not come with further instructions, just the UPS return label. I placed the modem in the box and took it to the UPS store on April 1, 2009. I received a bill for $66 shortly after, but the rep assured me that the charges would drop off once the modem was returned. A few weeks later, I got another bill. So I called and the rep asked when I had mailed the package and what the tracking number was. I did not have it on me at the time, so he told me to call back and provide it. I did the next business day, but this rep said, ""We don't need the tracking number; we got it already because we gave it to you!"" She assured me that the charge would be adjusted off once the box was scanned. The next month, I received another bill from Comcast and a collections letter from a company they hired regarding the $66. I called Comcast on 6/6/09 and the rep told me to go to my nearest customer center and give them the receipt. I did that, but the rep at the center said he couldn't help me because the modem number is not on the receipt. I tried to make it clear that I returned the modem in the box provided to me, not a brick! He again stated he couldn't help me and suggested I call their customer service number and speak with a supervisor! Here I am in a customer service center being told to call customer service! I called and requested to speak with a supervisor, but the rep outright refused! She stated the first thing that needed to be done was a box research. She completed the forms and told me I'd be contacted within 14 business days. I know that the box is sitting in some warehouse and hasn't been scanned yet! My best friend works for Comcast and he just so happens to scan returned equipment in their warehouses! I informed him of the situation and even provided him with the delivery date, time, and the person who signed for it. He knows the person that signed for the package and stated he would handle it. A week later, he called me and told me everything was taken care of. For some reason though, I wanted to be sure. So I called Comcast 7/7/09 and the rep told me that there was still a balance and I was sill in collections! I demanded a supervisor, but the rep told me to speak with the collections department. I called collections and they wanted to do another box research. I refused to be put off and wait another 2 weeks with no results. I again requested a supervisor, who noticed that a box research was put in on 6/6/09 but nothing had been done about it. He suggested I go to a customer service center and I informed him that I did and was turned away! He took down all of the information that I had to provide and promised to follow up with me. Hopefully, something gets done soon because this is affecting my credit. This is not fair!"
1,"I have been without internet since last Thursday (6/25). After numerous calls to Comcast, they agreed to send a technician out on Wednesday, 7/1. They agreed to call when they were 30 minutes away and did call at 1:45 pm. I got home at 2:00 pm and waited until 2:30 to call Comcast to find out where the tech was. The woman I spoke to told me their tech had already come and that I wasn't home. When I told her that I was told I would be given 30 minutes from the time of the call, she said she got in touch with the tech and he would be on his way back to my home before 3pm. At 3:15, I called Comcast again and was on hold until 4 before I was told the tech would not be coming and the person I spoke to before was incorrect when they told me the tech was coming back. Then I was told I would have to reschedule for Monday, 7/6! When I finally spoke to a supervisor, after my 3rd try because I was hung up on and then pushed back to the main menu, she basically told me that they aren't allowed to give 30 minutes and that if they call, they could be in my driveway calling. What? It's a bunch of ** and I still have no internet! I hate Comcast."
1,"I called Comcast in May, because my internet was out. They scheduled someone to come out. I took off work and was home when the technician came out. He checked the internet in my home, changed a splitter, and told me that my signal was low at the outside box. He said that he would send someone out to boost the line. The service remained slow and/or not working.The first of June it went out again. I called, took off work, and the technician came. Said I had a low signal and that he would send someone out to boost the line. The same thing, slow service and or not working at all. At the end of June, it went out again. I called, took off work, technician said that the line has a low signal, he would send someone out to boost the cable. The next day, I received a bill from Comcast that was for the service calls to my home even though that problem was on their end. (They had told me that I would me credited for the time without service. I called and was told that I did not have to pay the service charge and that they would correct my bill. For me to call in a couple of days to see how much I owe).Yesterday, the cable was out again, I called, they said that they would send a technician out. I told them that it was unnecessary because the outside cable line just needs to be boosted. They said that they did not see it on my records and that I would have to take off another day of work and await the technician. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She said that everyone was busy and I left my number, no one called. I called again today. The supervisor said that a work order for cable boosting was never put in and that I had to have a technician come out again. I told her that I had a copy of the statement that the last technician had stated that the problem was the low signal. I told her that I could fax it to her, I also had the phone number of the technician. She said that she was sorry, but that I would have to take off another day of work and have a technician come out. I have never been treated so badly. I am changing cable companies."
1,"I called up to get Comcast High-Speed Internet on 6/18. The technician arrived the next day (6/19) to install it, but ended up disconnecting my Dish Network wiring in order to use that to make the cable modem connection. I caught one of his errors while he was there when he disconnected the satellite feed to the room I was in. He indicated he could check to find the live cable feed, but alas, apparently chose not to.After he left, I then found another non-working satellite feed and called Dish Network and they came out on Monday (6/22) to track down the problem. You guessed it, the Comcast technician had disconnected another Dish Network cable to connect the modem. This one I just didn't catch before he left. All in all, I'm very dissatisfied. Not only was I charged $50 to have Comcast High-Speed Internet installed, I am also out the $49 it cost to have Dish send out a technician to resolve the issue your Comcast technician caused.And as you might guess, I am fed up with my Comcast experience and have canceled service (6/21). Someone is supposed to be by Tuesday (6/23) to pick up the cable modem. I am requesting that I don't get billed the $50 for the Comcast installation fee, nor any of the $36.99 initial monthly fee for the Comcast Internet Service. It will be interesting to see if I get a response. At the very least, call it lesson learned and never again will I consider Comcast for anything."
1,"I signed up for Comcast High Speed Internet at $19.99 per month for one year. This is still their advertised special. I received it at $29.99 per month. I explained that the $29.99 was neither the rate I was quoted nor the advertised rate. They refused to lower the rate. Additionally, the modem that serves both my internet connection and my existing phone service stops working several times per day and must be reset. This is a problem they are unable to fix. I am willing to accept the below par phone service but I feel the $10.00 difference between the advertised high speed internet rate and the billed rate is unfair. No damage, these people just waste time and wear me out."
1,"My internet has not been working properly for three months. Every time I call Comcast, they tell me to disconnect the modem and router to troubleshoot properly. I have done this numerous times. The internet is still not working. Comcast sent a technician to troubleshoot the issue. He said their signal was low and he would correct the problem. The internet does not work, again. Problem not solved!I changed the router and modem. Problem not solved. My neighbors say they are experiencing the same issue. I called Comcast and told them that my internet is not working and I would like a credit for the two months that it was not working. They said they will only issue one month's credit. I spoke to two different supervisors, and the last one I spoke with said I could not talk to her manager. She said she was the last step in the resolution process. Total crap! What kind of business is this? I am now cancelling my service with Comcast and going a different route. They have the most terrible service I have ever seen in my life!"
1,"I ordered a Comcast high speed internet connection. This was long time back. I went out of town for six months for work related reason and my internet connection setup was never completed. I spoke to Gavan, one of the customer service agent on June 5th 2009 to set up internet connection at my place and had really bad customer service experience with him. He started yelling at me on the call with high tone (high voice). When I asked for supervisor (Michael), Michael also supported him saying, ""I know he was yelling at you,"" and acknowledged that he was standing next to him when he was doing so. Michael, being a team lead never apologized or tried convincing me. Instead, I hear his voice was too supportive for Gavan. I am very disappointed with this call and customer service experience with the Comcast. I would never ever recommend anybody in future to go for this kind of service and end up with bad customer service like this. I know Comcast might not take this as important, as they would lose only one customer but like this, there will be several others who might be the victims of such bad customer service and may think the same way. I am now switching to another service provider. I already have a Comcast modem, (which I paid $60 just for modem + shipping), which I purchased while placing an order. I wanted my money back but Comcast customer service is not even accepting the modem back. I was warned by my friends not to go with Comcast because they had bad experience with Comcast before but it was all my mistake or I would say ""wrong choice"". I don't know how to escalate this to the upper management in Comcast."
1,"I was out of town on a business trip. I knew there was some kind of issue with my Internet when I could not remotely connect to my home computer. When I returned home from the trip, I was without service on my Internet, phone/fax and television. I called the Comcast number and was told that they would get right back to me with a time that a service technician could look at my service. I waited 4 hours and didn't receive a call. I called back and was told that it would possibly be 3 days until they could come. I asked to speak to a supervisor and explained to him that my office is at my home and I was losing business time related to the outage. He was quite rude. I then drove to the local office and was told again that they would call me to tell me when a representative could provide the service. Twenty-four hours later, no call and no service."
1,"This company has been not sending out regular bills to me monthly, which means I get late/disconnect notices and phony late charges. They also have not been posting my payments! I feel my information and or checking account could be compromised. This is very troubling that they can get away with this sort of thing! I have 2 other complaints pending with them as it is! My bill has tripled now! They say I owe them over $140-plus. My monthly bill is $45.00! Times are stressing enough without garbage like this going on! I will be filing for compensation!"
1,"I have been a long time customer of Comcast Internet and I have noticed some inequities that Comcast is offering involving their Internet service. It appears that in some areas, they are now offering a 12 mbps speed at an introductory offer at $19.99 for 6 months. Then it will return to the $42.95 a month that I am currently spending for only 6 mbps and the new rate will not be available in my area until 12/09 per Comcast representative. When I asked for an adjustment to at least the $19.99 for the 6 mbps, I was told that Comcast has only one base rate. This doesn't seem fair at all. Something needs to be done about this cavalier attitude towards consumers."
1,"I signed up for 1 year promo of cable and high speed internet for $24.95 a month. I should have realized it was a scam. A technician came out a week ago and did the install. Everything was fine. A week later and I can't get Comcast internet to stay online now. I called, did live chat and finally had to reinstall my Cricket USB modem. Wow! Cricket is working and Comcast isn't. I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. I'm just glad Comcast hasn't charged me as much as the other people on here. I'm giving them 2 more weeks and if they can't get it fixed, I'll switch to Qwest. Qwest has a pretty good promo right now too."
1,"On April 20, 2009 continuing to the present date, I have been experiencing rolling ""blackouts"" of internet service that I pay for from Comcast. I have called them 6 times in the last 6 weeks, have had technicians to my home that claim nothing’s wrong, and yet I continue to have denial of service with no explanation from Comcast. Approximately every 5 to 10 minutes, my internet connection is ""cut off"". The TV signal is fine. I continue to pay $30 a month for internet service that is completely unstable with no explanation from Comcast. Every time I am disconnected from the internet, around every 5 minutes, I lose whatever I was working on at the moment. I have lost thousands of dollars being cut off from my online stock brokerage account. There is no way to recover from the losses."
1,"Do any people still remember when Comcast bought AT&T internet, it raised up price immediately? I bought my 1st Motorola modem and it caused many disconnections after 1-2 years, thus I bought a 2nd RCA modem and used it another 2-3 years. And again, I need to reset the modem a few times a day. Each call to Comcast is a long time waste. I then turned over to DSL and it works 1-2 years and I reset it only once.I used to tent their cable modem for a short time then use one I bought from eBay. After 2 years, Comcast suddenly started to charge my rental free and asked me to return my modem. I called in and went in and they checked with the warehouse. A lady said I was correct yet manager said the case was not completed yet. A bad thing was when I returned the rented modem, nobody gave me a receipt. This time, I was forced to give them my modem and a kind lady did give me a receipt. But I still keep all PayPal records so that I may dig out my purchase record."
1,"My internet service with Comcast was disconnected for one year because Comcast claims that I was using too much bandwidth. I had been warned before but the person I talked to told me to purchase bandwidth monitoring software. If Comcast wants their customers to stay within certain limits, then they should provide bandwidth monitoring software. I should not have to purchase something like that myself. It should be provided by Comcast. When I opened my cellular account, I purchased a specific number of minutes that I can use every month. Whenever I want to find out how many minutes I have used, all I have to do is sign into my account and I can find out how many minutes I have used. Comcast does not have any such tool."
1,"We signed up for Comcast in May of 2008. We asked if the price was promotional, who doesn't now, and we remember being told it wasn't. Last week we talked to a Jennifer, and her supervisor, they were going to look up sign up phone call and see if we had asked about promotional price. They also said they would call us back - like I believe that. Today I was told by Amy, ""The supervisor was unable to pull the phone conversation. These are usually 6 month promotional so don't complain about rate increases.""Well, I am complaining. If you look at their ads on their website, we could only find one that said it was a promotional offer. Most of them never mentioned that the offer was limited. Our bill never showed promotional as we saw with our DirecTV bill. It never showed a promotional discount or anything that could have brought our attention to this situation earlier. I have looked into other Internet providers and they are the only one that isn't a dial up, available to me. We never signed anything but the work paper that said the installers have fixed any damages to my yard. My sprinklers were only fixed after 4 days of phone calls."
1,"I just realized my Comcast high-speed internet bill has practically doubled. When I signed up for it, no one from Comcast ever told me that the rate would increase. When I complained about this, the Comcast rep said that the service tech (who is a local contractor and not a Comcast employee) who installed it would have told us that the $42 was a promotional rate. I told the Comcast rep that I was not even home when internet was installed, so the rep then told me that the service tech (again, a non-Comcast employee) left information that said that the $42 a month was only a 6-month promotional cost. Why didn't Comcast tell me that when I was signing up for their service? Why does Comcast rely on a local contractor who is not even a Comcast employee to inform of forthcoming changes on my bill? I want to know why, when I was on the phone signing up for Comcast internet, that I was never told about the price increase. This is not right! I think that it is totally unfair that when I was on the phone signing up for the internet, a Comcast rep told me it was going to be $42 a month. They never said it was a promotional rate and was going to jump to $72. I think Comcast should tell you that when you are signing up for their service."
1,"I had trouble with internet connection for more than five days. I found that I could not connect internet from May 1st. I waited for the line to come back one day and I reported this trouble on May 2nd, very early in the morning. At the first call, I was told that I had to change the modem, so I dropped by a Comcast service center and changed the modem. But the trouble continued, so I called again. At that time I was told that there might be some trouble in our area, so I wait for about 4 hours and try connecting the internet. But after 4 and more hours, there was still no internet connection, so I called again. At this call, I was again told that the trouble might be a regional so I wait for more time and contact them. But the internet line never came alive.So I called again the next day (May 3rd) and scheduled someone to come over. Someone scheduled (Tuesday) May 5th for service, which was according to him, the earliest day possible. On the service day, the person came could not find the trouble and scheduled another service for the next day (May 6th). On Wednesday afternoon, finally, the service people could find the problem. The total time I could not access to the internet was more than 120 hours.After all of this trouble, I called Comcast for asking credit or refund for not being able to use internet for those days, as I told from one of the representatives I talked with. A billing representative I talked with told me that I could get 2 days of credit, which is about 2 dollars something cents. I explained her that the service could not be used for more than 5 days, but she said according to the record, she could just give me 2 days of credit. Maybe they counted only Monday and Tuesday because I reported trouble on Sunday and it was fixed on Wednesday.I could not use internet for 5 days and also the cable reception was not that good either during the time. I did not hear sincere apology or any care for my inconvenience. I even had to call to get refund, but all I could get was 2 days of credit and that is less than $3! I think I have to quit my Comcast service, and I'll tell all the people I know about this story so that they would know about Comcast more."
1,"I called Comcast to report an intermediate outage with my high-speed internet service and speed problem. The first time I called, I was told nothing was wrong. I knew that wasn't true. I have major issues with my line speed and when they come out, it's early and they said, ""You're not going to get any better than that. I'm sorry, sir."" Whatever. I have never experienced this slow of speed for six years of having their service at other addresses. And if it does not get fixed very soon, I am canceling my service and going elsewhere. I have been paying top dollar for crap and it's not worth paying as much as I do to deal with their stupidity. Their techs are very unprofessional. If it's not my house, grab your ladder and check the line in from the pole. I say it's pure lazy. They look around, don't test anything or make sure everything is tight. Then they leave and it messes up over and over again."
1,"I called Comcast to report an outage with my high-speed Internet service. The first time I called, I was told nothing was wrong. I knew that wasn't true due to experiencing it for a while at that point. I called the next morning. I was told the agent saw my signal problem and would schedule a tech visit. She tried to schedule it for Friday but that was ""already taken"" when she tried. So, the next appointment that would be able to fit my schedule was Tuesday between 5 PM and 8 PM. I did that because my wife and I both work and that was a time I knew we would both be there. The agent came before 3 PM, said nobody was there so the appointment was canceled. I called to complain and was told no appointments for my account were seen but a street service call had been made for my street and he would have tech come to my door. That never happened. I called today to get an update on what the street call discovered. There was nothing there regarding it and the only help I was going to get was to schedule another service call on Friday between 2 PM and 5 PM, which means on my day off, I have to sit in my house and wait for somebody to maybe show up. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told supervisors don't take calls and I would need to leave a message and get a call back. Of course, I was told a supervisor couldn't help. It has been a week now with these issues and no resolutions. My account has poor documentation and service calls I requested aren't showing on it.My Internet service is still spotty. My cable modem, which is five years old and out-dated technology, needs to be replaced and the tech should be doing that along with checking everything from my house out to the road. I am not required to take time out of my day to get a new cable modem and get it set up or take time out of my day to sit and wait for a tech who may not show up. All this time, I am not getting the service I am paying for each month."
1,"I recently disconnected my internet and phone service with AT&T due to telephone issues. I switched to Comcast ""high-speed"" internet and cable TV. I have only had the service for a few months and already I've called and contacted customer service almost 7 times! Ridiculous! Either my cable TV signal is screwy or the on-demand will not pull up. Now my Comcast ""high-speed"" internet is the slowest it's ever been! AT&T is better people! Seriously, I never had problem with their internet service and now I'm seriously considering switching back. Comcast is a joke. Their commercials are false and their internet is the worst I've ever had! Either it disconnects halfway through or it takes 10 minutes or more to connect, period! Getting from page to page is a hassle. I have to continuously refresh the page and retry! I've tried everything, even their McAfee security which is also a joke. My laptop is only 6 months old! My hard drive is clean and it runs smoothly without the internet. But every time I get online, it's one headache after another. I'm seriously fed up and their customer service rep on their online chat disconnected from me after she read my complaint. How rude! They are ignoring my complaints and have yet to find a solution! AT&T is so much better."
1,"We signed a contract with Comcast for phone and internet service in June 2008. Since then, we have been continuously overcharged and ignored, even though we saved all contractual documents. When we show up in person at a Comcast store, we are dismissed and told to call the 1-800 number. When we call the 1-800 number, we are told they can't help us because they can't see the contractual documents that we have, yet they won't provide a phone, fax, or mailing address to send copies. If this were a small business, it would be an easy legal suit. Comcast is so large and unorganized that each time I speak to someone new, most, if not all, of the notes on our account have ""disappeared"" and they aren't even sure who I've spoken to before or who made changes to my account. This is ridiculous. We've wasted countless hours trying to rectify the situation and whenever we are told the situation will be fixed and the credit will be applied to our account, it does not appear and those notes disappear. I am not sure what their employees are paid to do because they can never help us, and sometimes they flat out lie. It's disgusting that big businesses can get away with practices like this. I'm just waiting to receive my credit and cancel service."
1,"Out of the blue, my internet and home phone service with Comcast went out. Occasionally, a quick reset of the modem takes care of everything. This wouldn't come back on. I called the service people, who advertise their 24/7 availability, and was told that although they were still there, it was late in the day on Friday and nothing would be done. I was told at first that nothing would be done until Monday. Since the phone service includes 911, I protested. The representative told me my claim had been escalated and that someone would call me the next day (Saturday) and also visit that day to fix everything.Having heard nothing by nearly noon on Saturday, I called again. A representative tried to reset the system again and then told me when that failed that the service people would call me within 30 minutes. After an hour, nothing. My service came back on briefly and then disappeared again. I called Comcast again and someone reset the system again and I had service briefly. He apologized but didn't get in touch with anyone at service and more or less hung up before I could ask for a supervisor. My system went down yet again. I called Comcast and finally someone explained to me that the previous employee had lied to me or misled me about the way service works and that no one was ever going to just come out the next day or call within 30 minutes. While I appreciated his honesty, when I complained about the lack of 911 service, he told me, ""You don't want your service on so you can call 911"" and continued to refer to my outage as an inconvenience. No one anticipates calling 911. I've had to do it several times from my home, and I expect that a company that promises services I use for personal, business and emergency reasons will provide those services and not expect me to wait 72 hours to have them returned. The system has flickered back on, but no one has explained why this happened or made sure it won't happen again. At this point, I am in an agreement with a cancellation fee before two years, but I feel that Comcast should waive the fee. I'm certainly canceling my service. I'd recommend everyone be very careful about this company. Their promises are tantalizing but their service is reprehensible."
1,"Our cable, internet, and phone service are terrible. After five missed appointments, I stopped the phone service. The technician never showed! He dropped off the modem and I installed it. We have cable internet only sporadically and they again can't send a technician. They can't fix it over the phone. I pay my bill every month for service we cannot enjoy. The cable TV works, but is often snowy when the service is interrupted. I can't conduct my business so I have to use a local copy center for internet access. We watch videos and buy the paper since we can't watch TV. They know I don't have any options and are so arrogant when I call for help. "
1,"Comcast Internet double charged me on my internet. When I contacted them, they told me to adjust my bill and send in payment. I did, they cut off my service without calling and notifying me. When I contacted to explain the situation for the 5th time including hold times over 45 min., they told me to pay the full bill and they would credit my account the next bill. I explained again that Jerrod, operator **, told me to pay the amount I owed. Their excuse again was to pay all the over charges and they would correct it on the next bill. Their customer service is the worst unless you're off the coast of Somalia and dealing with pirates. This has not been the only problem with service. Phone has gone down several times. This is also a business line. Warning, stay away from Comcast."
1,"As I sit here waiting for a supervisor to get expedited service, I'm using my cell phone, of course, at my cost. I've been watching my modem reset every 5 minutes or so for the past hour, rendering internet access and home phone service virtually nonexistent. Yes, I made the mistake of getting all 3 services from Comcast. My telephone constantly drops calls, so my home phone service - a vital necessity - doesn't work. Last Friday, on a business call, it dropped 4 times in 1/2 hour. About 2 weeks ago, a service call was scheduled, but no one showed. I learned that if you're not home to take a recorded pre-service call the night before, the service call is cancelled. It's now been 15 minutes on my cell, and no supervisor has answered. As of now, my service is set for Friday morning - that's 2 1/2 days with a modem that resets every few minutes and no consistent phone service. This is what you have to look forward to with Comcast. "
1,"On 04/03/09, my email was not working so I called Comcast. They let me know that there was a problem with their service and they apologized. Shortly after that, a Comcast tech showed up here at my home to fix my computer (which by the way I did not order but since he was here, I figured it was a plus since he could now fix the problem). He asked what was the trouble. I explained that my email was not working so he proceeded to try and fix the problem. But instead, he and someone he contacted at Comcast decided that the way to resolve my problem was to change my email; he never asked me if it would be alright. By doing this they did away with my existing email which by the way I've had for 15 years and all my friends, family, banks, doctors and all the businesses I do business with cannot get in touch with me. Now Travis said that all I had to do was set up another email account. That is easy for him to say since it was not causing any problems for him. Here it is 4/6/09 in the evening and I still do not have my email back. They keep telling me they are working on it but nothing has been corrected as of yet. I've left a message for him (Travis **) but I still have not heard from him either. I am very frustrated and upset. I understand that this should never have happened, because no one has the right to change your email without permission. Someone forgot to tell Travis."
1,"On March 01, 2009, I had a service call by Comcast because of poor Internet service. The Comcast service tech diagnosed the problem as a faulty signal booster and removed the part. The signal booster had previously been installed by Comcast! The problem was fixed; however, Comcast billed us $24.95 for the service call to remove a faulty part they installed!. Between 3/6/09 and 4/6/09, I have placed four calls to Comcast to address this billing issue. I was told by two different customer service representatives that they would call back. To date, no one has called and I am still waiting for a $24.95 credit on my next bill."
1,"I am with Comcast and was unable to access my email. I got a 400 error and was asked to call Comcast or chat with a rep. I clicked on chat and after 15 minutes, I am still not connected. I called Comcast to report and got a message that they have a heavy call volume. They said to call back later and then I was hung up on."
1,"At the present moment I have been on the phone for approx 2hrs and 16 min.Trying to get ahold of comcast to cancel my internet service. No answer. I thought I would call new service, and would you believe, they answered in less than 5 seconds. Something is wrong here. I am ready to cancell all three services with comcast. The service is very poor. "
1,"Comcast Rewards Triple Play offered me a $4.99 movie credit.  I was unable to download the form and mail it to Comcast, so I contacted their customer service department, and was told on the phone by the male representative that he would look into why I was unable to download the form, and send me an email.  I never received the email and now the form is no longer on the website.  I was told that the movie credit was offered to me as a bonus for the services that I receive at Comcast.    Please look into this matter for me and thank you in advance."
1,"I've used comcast for internet and have had poor results with the service.I had to buy a new modem so that it would work. Now I've terminated their service and they want the original modem back or they will charge me an additional $40. Since the modem did not perform well(freeze up) and they demand it to be returned, it makes me think that the modem that failed was a used one to start with. They refused the replacement that was working perfectly. "
1,"I am tired of Comcast. I work from home as an independent contractor and usually work between 11pm and 3am. Six times in a row now my phone has went dead and my internet connection dropped in the middle of my shift. I called comcast today and they told me it was due to service maintenance and would occur on a regular basis - normally late at night (during my work shift). This is unacceptable to me! I have used other internet and phone service providers who have NEVER caused any service interruptions due to maintenance. They either need to lower my payments for my service or figure out how other companies do their maintenance without causing these interruptions! It's not like the service goes down for only 10 minutes - it takes hours!Since this is occurring during my work hours, it is causing me to lose money and also causing my managers to think of me as being unreliable. If it happens again, I may just be out of a job and who needs that right now during this recession?"
1,The comcast claims to provide a very high speed internet service. I have purchased their 12Mbs internet service package. I have also purchased their triple play service which is the most expensive service. I am their high paying customer. I don't mind paying high monthly fees as long as I get quality of service.  Lately comcast internet speed is very slow. I tried to call the customer service and they didn't help at all. I kept on calling multiple times and problem hasn't been resolved.  They claim to provide highest internet speed. All their commercial focuses on speed.  I am getting 54kbs internet speed. I am paying for 12Mbs. Their customer support was unable to help. I plan to switch to other internet service provider. It is painful to switch service to other provider and waste of my time and money. I have to do this but wanted to file complain for comcast so other people dont' suffer.  
1,"This is a follow up to my recent post.  After speaking to the head supervisor who was handling my case, she stated that they never received any of my faxes.  I told her that I found that very hard to believe.    I had verified that the fax number in fact was correct, and we managed to speak on a few occasions.  She was up front with me that she was in the phone and TV end of Comcast, but that she would discuss my problems with those in the internet department.  I got a phone call from her today, as she had promised.  She informed me that they were putting a $250 credit onto my account.  At least this was handled the right way, and they didn't offer me 18 months of a pay channel that I don't watch anyway.   Overall, once I put my foot down, which included a 30 day letter of demand from the Massachusetts General Law section, I ultimately got what I wanted, which was for Comcast to pay for my laptop. "
1,"I signed up for internet and phone service last October(2008) on a promotional that was represented by salesperson as one price for life package. I have copy of signed order form with the price for life written in and now Comcast wants to renege on the package we purchased in good faith.I canceled my existing phone service and internet at the time and went with Comcast to save money.  Based on the package program cost on my current bill,they wish to charge me an additional $32.91 plus associated tax more per month beginning mid April."
1,"I have had a contract for Highspeed Internet service with Comcast for 5 years. The price for that service has remained constant @ $46.21 a month. About 2 months ago Comcast sent me a notice saying they were charging me the wrong price for my service and would be making changes. I don't remember verbetum what the letter said, but it did say that if I was willing to add Television and Phone to my service package I could get a reduced price on the Highspeed internet. When I got my new bill, not only did my rate go up, but the megabyte per second speed went down to 4mbps from 6mbps. Plus, they prorated me for half a month?! I believe there are some unfair pricing practices going on. I feel like I am essentially being blackmailed into using Comcast's TV & Phone coverage just to keep a decent price for Highspeed Internet service. I think that Comcast is taking advantage of their monopoly on the Cable access to my community."
1,"I have been unable to get into my email so I contacted comcast only to find out that a few days before they were tying to do an up grade in their smartzone(email) and apparantly something went wrong and now a lot of customers, like myself ares having problems getting in. When I contacted comcast, Which has been 3 days in a row now. First day I was told about the problem and we went through a walk around. It now takes me three steps and at least 3 tried to get into my email. The Second day, I was walked through a delete process of deleting several items, Then in the middle of restarting, everything went dead and I was totally disconnect and I had to call back. The Second indvidual did the same thing the first one did. Only this time he did give ne a ticket number. He also told me that he was hopeful that this will clear up in a few days. How's that for customer. I am paying good money for what is suppose to be a fast service and they can not get it correct. And per this individual I spoke with it has now been just about a week and the problem is still not cleared. Paying for a service that I am not getting. I count on my emails to keep in touch with my family that is out of state. Comcast is selling a sevice that they are not providing and are not compensating customers when they make mistakes. "
1,"The modem for my internet and home phone use went dead. Replacement for this modem Must be done by a technician  and cannot be scheduled for 5 days.   Lets supposed not everyone in my house has a cell phone,,, that means NO ACCESS to a device that can provide an emergency call  to police  or fire dept., if required.   Give me back my ATT  service!   or provide a location to pick up  modem. These modems are no different than those that are sold on a shelve at Best Buy!  and my 12 year old grandson could and hook it up!    No access to email  or phone for my wife at this  time, who has used the internet for invites for a party this coming Saturday. ( no, not an emergency, but it sures does dissect someone from the regular world)."
1,"I have been in the process of filing a loss claim against Comcast for nearly a month now. I downloaded their McAfee Security Suite that they offer to high speed internet customers. Along with crashing my hard drive and fracturing my registry, I lost my computer for 10 days. I had a Comcast tech come out to the house and within 2 minutes proved to me that it was not a Comcast issue, but my computer was trashed. I got on the phone with Comcast the day I got my computer back, and told them that a product that they are offering on their website caused my computer to fail. I told them that I felt that the $250 to repair my computer should be given back to me. The woman agreed and told me that the Claims Division will get to me within 72 hours. The claims person, John, did get back to me, and asked me to fax him the copy of my invoice for my repair. I also wrote him a statement of facts as a timeline so he could see what happened. I wrote on my cover letter, Please call me to let me know that you have received all pages in good order. I never received a phone call back. While trying to get in touch with him again, Comcast is unable to give a direct number to their Claims Department. In fact, I can't find anything online or over the phone for it. I sent the same faxes again, only this time, I made the Call me back statement huge and bold. Again, I never received a call. I had to go out of my way to my local Comcast office, and pleaded with the person to give me John and his supervisor's email address so I could get in touch with them. He does it, and wouldn't you know, the email address is inter-office only and doesn't allow outside email addresses in. Today, I sent a fax in 56 point font saying, Would John or Julie please call me at the number listed below. Guess what, no phone call today. I am at the point where I think that legal action is my only resort. Their complete lack of customer service is horrendous. I'm not asking them to put a man on the moon, I'm asking them to call me back and let me know that they received my faxes. Claims like this always seem to be lost or we never received it. My next move tomorrow is to call and cancel my service. Maybe then I will get an answer.$250 for repairing my laptop. 10 days of no computer, and no ability to keep an update of my work status (Union worker) Too many hours on the phone or online trying to get somebody to answer my simple questions, only to get re-routed to another generic 1-800-COMCAST phone number that says the same things to me that I've already heard 5 times that day."
1,"comcast states they have 24 hour tech support, I am trying to get help to get my new computer to access my comcast internet and they hung up on me,I still can not go online with my new computer"
1,"I recently upgraded my internet service with Comcast to there 12 MBPS offering from their dumbed down 1 MBPS service.   For a week now I have tried to have them show me proof that I am actually getting 12 MBPS.  Consistently for the last week, various speeed tests that I have performed on multiple web sites have never produced a download speed greater than 960 KBPS.  Comcast reps consistently state that I have the 12 MBPS service but always avoid the question when I ask for proof.  I examined all the hardware, checked the connections, I am using there modem, so that is not an issue. They installed the lines just over a year ago, the computers get higher donwload speeds at other locations (non Comcast).    I think they are scamming people by selling a service that they are not actually offering.  Selling 12 MBPS when they are only supplying 1 MBPS is wrong.  They should be penalized for this business practice if in fact this is what they are doing and should have to reimburse if they have been deceitful in there practices.  I am requesting more comments and investigation into there practices...   Major waste of time, performance of my system.  There is no physical damage and the economic damage is somewhat intangible.  Maybe this is why they get away with it, because they know that the complaint process is cumbersome and most will acquiesce before going to the trouble."
1,"I am facing some issues with Comcast. I started their bundle services from July 2008 at $59.99. After some time the voice quality on the phone was very bad. It has frequent drop calls and sometimes the numbers are not getting dialed also. As a result i want to get it disconnected. When i called Comcast Customer Service, I was told that i cannot do that-if i do i need to pay the same price($59.99) for my comcast internet and that will be a lower speed internet(1X). Right now i m using double bundle with the comcast modem and the monthly bill comes out to be around $70.00  So is it okay that they charge $59.99 for the lower speed internet? I am asking to disconnect the phone which is having a lot of issues.  My next door neighbor is just using the comcast high speed internet and paying only $24.95. When i compared my speed via speed test, he is having the same speed that i am getting. So here Comcast is fooling people-I am getting the 1X speed even when they it's 6X. When i told comcast customer service that this option is available to have only high speed internet rather than both the services, they turned down my request for that also. They say we don't have that promotion now and i have to pay $59.99 even if i just use the so called High speed internet from Comcast. It's irony that everytime i call customer service I get different answers. Whatever they commit on the phone call, they are not ready to follow after a day itself. Very bad experience till now.My monthly bill from Comcast comes out to be around $70(with a lot of taxes etc..). On top of it because of this bad comcast phone, I need to buy a cell phone which I need to pay around $74 per month. I should have been paying only $24.95 with taxes it comes out to be around $28. So every month I am paying an additional $42.00 more for a lousy phone service."
1,"Arnold is but one of a few poorly trained service representatives we have had to deal with in our relationship with Comcast Cable.  We switched to their high-speed broadband Internet service about two years ago. Things were fine until about six months ago when the modum (leased from Comcast) died.  Since then we have had to replace the modem twice and had a new cable hooked up to the house by various technician.  The latest modem (#3) died a few days ago. I called their Customer Service and they tried to fix it over the phone and finally said we had no connection. We had two options.  A technician could come and fix the problem or we could unhook the modem and take it to a Comcast payment center and have it replaced at no charge.  We went to the payment center and Arnold gave us a different modem.  I asked if it was new and he said it was a refurbished one from their warehouse. I also told him this was the third modem we had in six months.  His reply was that he had also had problems with his modem from Comcast and when he switched to their phone service, no more problems. We tried to hook up the new modem and power cord.  Comcast said to call them after we hooked it up.  We got no signal, so we called.  We talked to a very nice CSR named Tanya.  After several minutes she found out the reason we had no signal, noone had scanned our current modem into their system.  She took the time to do this.  I also found out that the servic call in which Comcast had installed a new cable to our house (which was supposed to be done at no charge per the technician who did the work) had been charged to our bill.  This work was done in January.  We did not receive a statment from Comcast in February.  When we did receive the March statement it had a $27 service call and also a late fee of @$6 added onto to our bill.  Tanya said we shouldn't have been charged for the service call and waived it.  She also waived the late fee and we had always paid our bill on time in the past.  We now have a working modem (for how long, who knows). I took the old power cord back the Arnold at the payment center.  He said I noticed that you had a service call and late payment waived from your account.  He said, See, we are working for you.  I told him we also had to wait for the new modem to be scanned into the system before it could be activated and the only reason the other items were waived is because we called and pointed it out to Comcast.  Arnold said, Have a nice day! Are we fortunate to pay Comcast $60/month for this frustration and lousy service.Each time we have had to contact Comcast, it takes us 2-3 including the wait for either a technician or CSR (who usually speaks English as a second language, which is hard to understand)to try and take care of the problem.  We don't get any monetary compensation from Comcast for the time we spend fixing their problems.  If we have any other problem, we will be switching to another company.  Unfortunately, their service will probably be the same.  So sad for the American consumer.  A sign of the times."
1,"I have had Comcast service since it first took over AT&T cable. As their product offering increading their service has deterioratad. To the point where pricing goes increases and they limit my ability as a consumer to control my monthly bill.The last time i moved i was forced to utilize one of thier modems even though i had purchased mine through one of thier speciasls in order to avoid 'monthly modem fees. They also gave me a 'introductory' cable/ internet rate and was told i could modify it in the future as needed. Possible even obtain 'a la carte' services.  Today i was told that wasn't possible and could only downgrade to 20 channels for $15 or pay the $60. What? $15 or $60, where is the in between?!!! Then my internet service is not tiered at speeds, this was never the case before. We paid a flat fee for flat service. It's either $24 for 1mb or $45.95 for 6mb. Comcast is forcing consumers to bare bone service or excessive pricing.  Unless you choose to Bundle all three of their services.  They should NOT be allowed to treat consumers like this!Financial implications of unauthorized monthly fees and unclear billing practices. "
1,"When I moved to a new place I found out they had Comcast High speed and cable. I share the cable with three other people, and only 2 of us have a laptop. About 3 week's ago suddendly I lost all internet access so did my roomate.. I called Comcast a number of times and they are trying to tell me it's my computer, which is very strange since I have a PSP and a PS3 which is having the same problem. After weeks of calling them and pulling my hair out we cancelled Comcast and went to Verizon. We are not going to pay Comcast for something we cannot get.They should have stayed with TV service."
1,"I have had numerous problems related to my internet connection. My service has been accidentally disconnected by Comcast on a number of occasions over the past 12-18 months that required on site technicians. Comcast claims that because I do not subscribe to their other services that it's possible to be disconnected from time to time.I've also had performance related issues that are ongoing. First I had trouble where I would lose sync throughout the day. After having several technicians on site to diagnose and make adjustments to cabling outside the home my sync issues have been finally corrected. I still have a problem with extremely high latency. The average time to deliver a packet to a local yahoo server (ICMP ping) is anywhere from 150ms to 600ms depending on time of day. I have some packets taking upwards of 2000ms. I've contacted Comcast technical support several times. In the past 48 hours I have been hung up on 3 times. I have been incorrectly transferred twice. I have spoken with 4 separate technicians who have concluded the following; 1. I don't know, I'm on the wrong package and need to pay more, one I troubleshooted with for an hour with no resolution before I had to get off the phone to attend to other personal matters, and finally one who resolved to have a technician come on site. I count on my internet connection for work, and personal use. I've lost countless hours to troubleshooting, hold times, productivity down times. I've had no other high speed alternative until AT&T recently launched it U-Verse service in my area. I have schedule to have that installed early next month. I plan to disconnect services as soon as my replacement service is in place.I've contacted Comcast technical support several times. In the past 48 hours I have been hung up on 3 times.

1,"Having problems with our internet service. Comcast came out a few weeks ago to move the box in hopes of better connection. The modem still does not work. Made appt for technician to come out on 2-15-09. They said I never answered the phone to confirm the appt. They rescheduled it for 2/16/09 between the hours of 8:00 - 11:00. Called to confirm 2 times. I called again at about 1:15 p.m. and Comcast said I called and cancelled the appointment, which I did not do. All they can do is apologize. I have no service but they still charge me."
1,"We are very concerned about the practice of updating or changing formats on the website with no explanation of how to use them. For example, the new SmartZone for the Comcast email just showed up one day. There was no explanation of how to use it and it is very confusing, especially at first. We were able to figure most of it out over several days but some things needed to be fixed by the service rep and we had no way of knowing that. After 40 minutes on the phone to Comcast with a service rep, many changes in the format by the rep, and some terse exchanges, we are finally (maybe) able to use our email effectively. This is not an acceptable way to do business. We pay a lot of money every month for this service, and it is inexcusable to make it harder and harder, with no explanation as to how to use the upgrades. You know, there are many of us who did not grow up with computers who really do need a simple explanation when things are changed. This would be the minimum expectation for any business."
1,My internet has worked halfway since I got it. My dial up worked better.. I am so disappointed with this internet. I can't do my work online because it freezes and just jumps offline at anytime.
1,"This company apparently tries to make money by fooling people. In two locations where I have had their internet service, the signal strength would fluctuate and the service would be intermittent. Countless hours were spent on the phone to resolve it and waiting for technicians to come one after another to all do different simple things that did not work to resolve the problem. There were sometimes charges for this and no, none of it was related to wiring inside my walls as they would like to occasionally assert. They are quick to try to sell you the service protection plan, from which they get a guaranteed revenue stream. I am not sure but I would like to know if they can manipulate your signal from their remote location because every time I have called for this problem, ironically within a minute of having someone on the line, all the lights on the modem shine solidly! I'm venturing a guess that they cause these situations purposely in order to convince people they need the protection plan and more profit for them!"
1,"I signed up for Comcast internet for $30 a month. Upon receiving my bill for the 4th month, the charge was $60. I called Comcast and they told me that when I signed up, $30 was the introductory price and that after 3 months I would be billed $60 regularly. I told them that when I set up the account, I was never told that. Plus, I had to pay a $50 installation charge. To make matters worse, during the time I was being billed, I couldn't even use the internet!!! Every month I called and they said they would credit my account when the problem was fixed.The problem was NEVER fixed. The Comcast representative stated that since there was no contract, they could charge me whatever they wanted. And even though they have record of my account never being used, they still billed me for the service. I told the rep that I have six kids and I would never sign into an agreement for $60 a month for internet when I could get it from Verizon for $15 a month. Geez, for $60 a month, the internet had better wash my dishes, mop my floors and clean my windows!!!"
1,"My connection is extremely slow whenever I try to download anything. The only thing I'm able to do at a decent speed is play a video game. Unfortunately, that's not what my entire day consists of. Since the beginning of Jan 2009, my connection has slowed considerably when it came to downloading anything. What use to take less than an hour, I'm now canceling the download because I can't get it to finish within 4 hours. Whenever I try to e-mail attachments, I've noticed that those particular e-mails have problems getting sent. Non-attachments are sent just fine.I've contacted Comcast several times regarding my connection speed. I've even had them come out and take a look at my modem. However, the last time I scheduled an appointment, they never even showed up. Even after they called me to verify I was home, I waited 2-hrs and they never showed nor called to apologize or re-schedule."
1,"My family and I have had Comcast Hi Speed internet ever since it was made available in our area. We have been very well pleased with the service. We love Comcast's speed, and their very courteous customer support. Keep up the good work, Comcast, and my family will be customers for life. Comcast rules."
1,"I have been using Comcast internet service for years now, paying my monthly fee of $33. I use my internet for everything, as a phone, for my emails, to check train or bus schedules, etc. Now, without warning, Comcast has upped my internet bill to over $50 a month, and on my already stretched budget, I'm going to have to cancel my only means of communication. Comcast claims that they upped the bill to cope with new changes they made to my service, but I honestly feel that is a hollow lie to mask the utter greed that motivated this decision."
1,"An open letter to Comcast:I have received terrible customer service from Comcast while trying to attain service. I already have Comcast service in IL and I am attempting to receive it in MA. I have been a customer for 4 years and will soon have two accounts. While attempting to obtain service in MA, I was disconnected from the ""installation"" department twice - requiring me to make a total of three calls, totaling 1.5 hours. Once I received a service ""order confirmation"" I was told the technician could be expected between 3 and 7 pm on Wednesday, January 28th, 2009 and that the technician could call 15 minutes in advance of the service appointment. Several days later I received a call from a call center (possibly in India and Sri Lanka) where a gentleman informed me I had not set up a service call yet. To double check this, I called back the ""installation department"" and confirmed the appointment, taking approximately another 40 mins. On the day of the service appointment, I receive a call at 11 a.m. from a ""technician"" who explained that he would like to perform the services earlier because of other cancellations. I explained that this was not possible as I was working at that time and that after his other appointments, he should call me 15 minutes before he was able to perform the service - as I was told was possible by the ""installation department."" He called me at 3:48 p.m. and said he had called me 0.5 hours earlier, which my call logs document was not the case. He said that he had been there since 3 p.m. on the dot and that I was not there - which made no sense since he would likely have called me at 3 p.m., more like 45 minutes prior. I told him I would be there in 15 minutes, at about 3:53 p.m. by that point, making my arrival at 4:08 p.m. possible. He said he would be there. When I got there at 4:08 p.m., he was nowhere to be found. After this I called him on the number he had called me on and he said I would have to call dispatch to have him sent back on a new call to my house. I called for dispatch and was told by 800-Comcast that they, dispatch, would be in touch in 30 mins, approximately 4:45 p.m. At 5:25 p.m., I received a call from dispatch, more than an hour later, and was told that nothing could be done. I wasn't getting service that day. Also, I was told that they, dispatch and installation in this area, don't perform service calls during the 3 to 7 p.m. time frame I was allotted by the ""installation department"" and that they don't call customers to let them know they are coming. But evidently they call customers to see if they can inconvenience them and come early.So I ask you sirs, how can a company with such grand resources and such cutting edge, ""high-speed"" technology be so unprofessional? Why does the left hand not know what the right hand is doing and why is the customer the victim of these inconsistencies? So, here I am, using the internet I have to get through my blue-tooth tethered cell phone to complain about services I was promised by Comcast in the hopes that my comments will be heard. I am using up more of my valuable time on this earth complaining about simple things that Comcast should be able to accommodate. After these troubles, I am contemplating canceling all Comcast service, on both accounts, and choosing another television/internet service provider that will perhaps value its customers more. Thank you very much for your time.I never received any response from them and their comments are limited to 1500 characters. Also, no one at 800-Comcast would transfer me to complaints or customer care type departments."
1,"I have Comcast connection which creeps all the day, somewhat better during night times. Tech Support asked me, ""Are you in Apartment or near to apartment?"" As I live in Apartment... Technician says... I will never get speed I have subscribed for as there will be 1 line shared for the entire Apartment. Comcast is unable to deliver the service (speed promised) for the charges they are collecting."
1,"As a Comcast high speed internet subscriber, I have complained all the time to Comcast reps that my connection speed are very slow. Instead of 5Mbs I only get around 1Mbs, but since three weeks it escalated that I only have at random times for a few hours internet connection at all. I call every single day and every time I get an apology and they send techs out to the street, sometimes up to two trucks and 5 techs then the connection works for a few hours and we start over again, no connection. It is not just me, it is the whole neighborhood with about 30 customers and even 10 of their phone customers have no connection. They can not even dial 911. They charge a lot of money and provide the most unreliable service I have ever experienced."
1,"Not sure if this is the right ""complaint site"" however, my problem is with the new internet change to view our e-mail. What was wrong with the way the site was featured before! I now have to figure out how to view all people in my address book, add them to the e-mail I want to send and then try to find the send button. I'm not extremely computer savvy however; isn't the fun in sending e-mails supposed to be fun? Mine, since you've changed the features is not. The font is smaller and I feel more difficult to review. CHANGE IT BACK, if it's not broke, don't fix it please."
1,"I signed up for Comcast Triple Play several months ago and was supposed to get high-speed internet as part of the package for $33/month for a year. My latest bill now has two line items under Comcast High-Speed Internet, both called Blast! One line is for $33 and the second line is for $10. When I called to inquire about the $10 charge, I was told it was part of the high speed internet package. I asked if that is different from the original package I signed up for and she said, ""No, it isn't."" I have no recourse but to pay the additional $10/ month. I have nothing in writing that defines the package I originally purchased. Advice to Comcast customers: When you buy a service from Comcast, get an itemized list that defines exactly what is included in your purchase and how much you will be charged for it per month."
1,"I was a happy internet user from 4-30-08 to 8-15-08. Wanted to upgrade my system with a phone system that also included a fax line. Needed this due to starting a small business at home that would also include e-commerce online business. Well, on 8-15-08 they came to install the phone system. The guy could not get it done, left for 2hrs and came back with another tech, and finally they got something going but it still was not 100% okay. When the 2nd tech came, he asked for my modem. I gave it to him and they went to the pickup... I never saw it again. Then I was not getting all my calls - it would send them to voicemail. I could not use my fax line to send or receive faxes. I told them about this. On 9-3, when I paid on the account, I paid $40 on the internet account so I told her. As time went on, nobody contacted me at all... Then in 10-7-08, I had minor surgery that turned into major sickness... And about the 12th or sometime, someone finally called... 30 days after reporting the problem. I told her I was too sick to talk, give me a number and I would call her back... She did. Then I called her back on 10-15-08. The lady who called was out, so we talked to the one who answered. Of course, she knew nothing and said she would have the lady call me back. On 10-21-08 they turned off the service. Also, when the installed the phone, they did not tell me they were combining both internet and phone on one line. I wanted them separate. After all, I had the internet since 4-30-08 and wanted that regardless of the phone... Yes, without ever getting back to me to see what the problem was, they turned off all the services.I was still ailing from this surgery, but made it over to St. Paul and took another letter of Dispute & Complaint about the service. I gave it to Kathy ** and she saw I was not feeling well. She promised she would take care of it and get my service back on. When I got home, the service was on (11-7-08). However, that following Monday, 11-10-08, it was turned off again. Liz, a tech, came out late that afternoon to check it out... No service. She could not do her job. She called and told them that... They just told her to leave, saying I OWED... A LIE! She apologized and said to get in touch with the president, inform him and go from there.. she could not do any more. Again, they never contacted me to get it corrected or anything. Then I got injured in an accident in November and could not continue the fight with them. I did not really recover from these injuries until the new year of January 2009. On November 26, 2008 I faxed Jeff ** a Letter of Dispute, informing him what I had been through and needed corrected. Then they finally began to contact me, but of course I had no phone, no way to be contacted and was out when they called. I tried to contact the person, but had no luck. Then when I called them on 1/9, the contact person was not there, etc. Then a John ** came out and talked with me. I showed him everything and he said they would get it fixed. That was it. Time.. time.. nothing. Then when I finally did get someone, he knew nothing about all of it. They wanted me to PAY again for another installation. I said, ""NO, your system DID NOT WORK CORRECTLY... NO, the equipment was defective."" They changed 3 boxes before it worked at all.Then on top of that, my modem had been stolen and taken, and zip about returning it. This has been a nightmare. I had a website to upload e-commerce to in order to make a nice income, so I can get off SS. Then I got 2 unsigned letters from Comcast stating all they did, etc. But nothing about any mistakes, defective equipment, what it had cost me, etc... No they have done nothing wrong, etc. They considered this matter closed... Yeah, I guess so. They never do anything right as I am told by everybody else here. Here I sit, nothing... Everything cut off and they will not budge to correct what they DID wrong. I want my internet, regardless, but I am not going to pay for something they CUT OFF that I have not used... Please HELP ME so I can get my website made and make some decent income. This has caused me many sleepless nights, emotional upsetness, brought me to a standstill, and I can do absolutely nothing for my business. Please HELP!"
1,"Comcast Broadband Internet access has become so slow and unreliable that any Internet search or browsing has become extremely frustrating and wasteful of time. I use it for working at home, which means occasional attendance or presentation of webcasts. With the high UNRELIABILITY of Comcast, this has severely affected my work productivity. It will also ADVERSELY affect America's work productivity in this digital age. This is forcing me to look for slower but more reliable alternatives like Satellite Broadband, DSL or 3G mobile modem."
1,"I am having a problem with very slow speed on the internet. In the past, it turned out that Comcast was upgrading and the service improved. Calls to Comcast prove worthless because personnel are not informed of internal service upgrades or problems. Generally, I ask where the operator is located; it's usually far away and operator is capable of sending serviceman to our home where he informs us that he cannot figure out the problem. This is my last complaint. If no satisfaction, I am moving to another service. I am not alone, neighbors report the same problem since January 14. What has happened to you?"
1,"About 6 months ago, I started noticing that my internet service would slow or stop. At that point, I called and they told me that the modem needed to be reset and i could do this by unplugging the modem and waiting 10 seconds. That would work, but only temporarily. More recently, while I've been trying to watch movies via Netflix on my computer, the connection would either slow considerably or stop completely. I called again and the operator said my connection wasn't being recognized. To fix that, she suggested I unplug the modem and disconnect the cable for about 30 seconds. That works, again temporarily. This has been happening at least 3 times every time I'm trying to use the computer, regardless of what task I'm trying to do."
1,"I pay for high-speed internet access in South St. Paul Minnesota. Yet, the service I receive from Comcast is frequently slow or completely unavailable at times. I've called and also participated in live chats with Customer Support. They always assume that the problem is my computer or my router but none of these are problematic and my computer can access a high-speed WiFi network in other locations. The problem is the Comcast network. If I use the connection at 2 am, it works fine; if I use it during the day, I frequently encounter problems. Comcast is selling a high-speed system that is overused and therefore not functioning as they describe in their advertising. It's obvious that they must know this but they blame the consumer."
1,"I'm paying for high-speed internet (5mbps) and am getting between 756 kbps and 1.4mbps. I contacted customer service and am told that they show the modem is receiving data at 5mbps. I disconnected the router, rebooted the modem, connected each of two available, re-booted computers directly to the modem and I'm still getting slow speeds (1.1mbps). Time to stop paying for high speed broadband and go to AT&T DSL, which costs half the money and still provides speeds in excess of what Comcast's high speed connection actually delivers. This is a bad company that cheats its customers and really needs to be put out of business..."
1,"I moved to Boca Raton two months ago. I had high speed internet for many years. However, in Boca Raton, they are advertising high speed for $34.00 a month. I called them to install mine because the deal was nice. The first day, the internet was wonderful. Perfect! The next day, I tried to connect, but I couldn't. So, I called the number, 1-800-266-2278, and they taught me to install it again. However, the connection is very slow, much different from the first day and much different from the high speed internet I used to have before. The connection being perfect when they came to install it, no connection the next day, and a really bad connection after they helped me to install it leads me to think they tricked me into a deal that they are not willing to honor.I called them and complained about the slow connection. They sent someone here and told my daughter that this is what it’s supposed to be and that the signal is perfect. Again, I had high speed for years and what they installed here does not agree with the first day installation, neither does it agree with the high speed internet I am aware of. I really believe that they installed a slower version, the one they should switch after six months when their advertised promotion expired. I feel cheated by Comcast, and it is the second time I called them without answers. They keep telling me to turn off the computer and the modem when I know the problem is with the connection. I wish I knew a number to tell on them so that Comcast gets some close investigation. If they did it to me, they are doing to other people for sure."
1,"Billing... detailed billing... What are all these service fees, one time surcharges, high speed service charge? Why have a PACKAGE DEAL to save yourself all the extra FEES? Meanwhile, my internet goes out, my cable blacks out while watching a movie. I called Comcast and spoke to someone halfway across the country. The local office is 4.5 miles from me. I'm given a reason for the black-out or frozen channels or no internet - WE ARE WORKING TO UPGRADE SERVICE IN YOUR AREA.Hello? This service isn't available to me and won't be for years. I'm paying my bills, getting crappy service and being shut down while others are being upgraded? Come on, all customers should have credited to their accounts all of the shutdown, black-out or frozen channel errors (made while these upgrades are being done). It is appalling how many times this has and is going to happen... and then... why are you paying $31+ a month already for high speed service. And now, Comcast is offering it to you for $31+ for 3 months and then will whack you after that for $52+ per month? We are already paying high speed service fee. Check your DETAILED BILL."
1,"I lose internet service connection repeatedly plus have very slow speed caused by reverse flow from median connection to my house even with brand new coax line. Comcast broke two set appointments via two different supervisors, Kathy ** and Peggy **. After waiting two different days for techs to show up, I asked for an entire month's bill to be credited but they refused. I want Insight back. They treated me as a valued customer. Comcast people just do not care. It is apparent by the bull they communicate from Customer service. It's time to find new service, Verizon broadband."
1,I just want to express my extreme dissatisfaction with Comcast's supposed Hi-Speed Internet. What a joke for the money paid each month!
1,"In August of 2008, I called Comcast and wanted to have internet cable installed at my business in Lunenburg, MA. I am going to rent out the building I am in and the interested tenant needs internet service or the building is no good to him. I also have the pipe in the ground to run the cable from the pole to building when I built the building in 2004. After going back and forth with Comcast on the price and installation time for 3 months, they told me the price was $700.00+ and I had to pay it upfront to get an installation date. I paid it on 10/14/08 and since then I have called at least 10 times and I do not yet have an installation date as of 12/31/08."
1,"I waste countless minutes multiple times each day re-booting my Comcase-provided RCADCM425 cable modem for internet service and my Linksys router behind it.   I have identical router set-ups in two other places, both of which use DSL (Verizon in one location and Embarq in the other) and have had zero problems with either for years.  I have phoned Comcast customer service but the result is always the same.  Within 24 hours I'm back in the basement, rebooting its mdoem and my router.    Why does this problem exist?It is a huge inconvenience to have to walk fromthe thirfd fllor to the basement to re-start everything.  yesterday I had to do this 8 times, and might have had to do it more often had I actually bveen continuously using my PC."
1,"Comcast needs to stop advertising for new customers. They can'r get it right. Our phone service, and Internet Service will not go and stays down 70% of the time. Comcast lies! They give untrue reasons for outages and you are out of luck if your service goes down on a Friday! My business depends on the Internet. Comcast, $100+ a month is a lot of money to steal from people.  Either ghet with the program or shut your doors! DO NOT GO WITH THE BUNDLE Loss of wages, worried about needing 911 when phone shuts down, can't get anything done with my Internet jobs."
1,"Lousy service. Internet connection keeps dropping about 20+ times a day.  I have to get up from my PC, go to the router and reboot it, and reset up my wireless network. This problem seems to affecting everyone I know. We have no other choice for internet service."
1,I recently got a computer last Thursday and got Comcast Internet Service well on Tuesday night 12-15 my service went down.  I have made several calls with my ticket number CR14848130 to no avail on status all I am hearning is 72 hours...to me that is unacceptable.  I just want this complaint to be sent to Comcast to let them know as a comsumer this is not acceptable for a service I pay for and I am not able to use it.The fact I have conformation's being sent to me and I cannot access my account to confirm or decline.
1,"1)I had sporadic internet service last week, had to schedule service for 12/12 in the evening (I work days). Even though I was home from 5-8, no one came to my house. I called Comcast, and they said it had been fixed.   2) This week I am without internet again. They cannot schedule me until 12/18, 5-8.   3) Since I have been without internet home, I tried to check my email remotely from work tonight. I couldn't get in, called Comcast. It (Smart Zone)is not working all day!!!  4) I tried to get a credit for all of this time, and I have to call in yet again to get it extended to the time when my NEXT service is schedule. Loss of internet services for 2 weeks. Please credit for one month, due to the inconvenience to me."
1,"This complaint has been resolved, but you should post where others can see it! I also had a problem 2 years ago. I wanted to add their internet service so I went online and looked it up, their website said 19.99 for the first 3 months, so being as smart as I am I took a screenshot and saved it on the computer(for windows just hit the print screen button open a word doc and select edit paste or ctrl v). So I got my first bill and the internet service was 39.99 I called, was passed around for about an hour, got frustrated and hung up, called back the next day and the same thing happened, well I did this for a week, got so mad, I decided to contact the BBB. Within a week a representative called me from comcast, told me that he was going to refund the total amount I paid for the internet over the 3 month period which was like 120$, I said thank you now go ahead and cancel my services, he had the nerve to ask me if I had  contacted them (comcast), to see if they could match the price, I lost it. I politely told the man that I would never do business with comcast again.  With that said my girlfriend just moved into a house and decided to get comcast, after I specifically told her not to, and guess what they told her it would be 19.99 for the first 4 months over the phone (not lucky enough to get a screenshot!), so now I have to go through the process again considering they are charging her 61$ for high speed internet. if you are having a problem with them log on to the Better Business Bureau website and file a complaint, they are paid to investigate, and companies like comcast will reimburse you the money because they do not want negative claims filed with the BBB."
1,"why am i getting so much spam, since comcast installed a new format for getting e-mail. its useless for me to call them, as they just give you the run-around.    thank you for listening"
1,"I've been with Comcast for over 1500 days, and the day they migrated to SmartZone my 2000 emails were deleted. As an email service SmartZone is a joke. If somebody emails you with images attached and you try to send a reply, it is impossible to un-attach the images from the original email on your reply. Its time to take them to court, and to switch over to Verizon. After paying $50 per month for over four years the emails I've gathered have all been lost. These included gallery communications which I cannot refer to, and dealings with clients whom I have freelanced for. I cannot begin to calculate the negative consequences this will have on my career."
1,"When I attempted to add Digital Voice and High Speed Internet as a package with my current COMCAST basic cable TV service, I discovered their predatory and clearly deceptive policy as to whether a new customer can use their own modem. While the sales rep. had indicated I would be required to rent a modem ($5/mo. + $50 security deposit)I learned shortly thereafter that a costomer-owned modem  could be allowed. I bought one from a local computer tech. who made sure I was getting one with both the internet and phone ports. Upon arrival for hook-up of my service, the Comcast installer noted immediately that he wouldn't be able use my modem rather than renting one to me. He actually had an identical modem (used) with him as a rental but explained that the only customer-owned modem Comcast would allow would be one which wouldn't actually work in my case (no phone port). He explained that Comcast only allows modems with serial #'s (not model #'s) which they have registered within a specific service district. He was reluctant to offer this explanation but did so as he felt sorry for me after the two calls to his supervisors, at my request, werefully unhelpful. I refused to agree to the modem security deposit and rental as I had a modem which the installer indicated would work fine if allowed by Comcast. After cancelling the installation I called the West Palm Beach Comcast office and asked to speak with a Customer Service Supervisor. I was transferred to a Sales supervisor who would answer my questions with only one sentence: That's our policy. My complaint to the Comcast Executive Comlaint Center, by e-mail, resulted in a brief form e-mail saying someone would contact me for complaint details. There's been no response. What a fiasco!        Because of Comcast's misleading and deceptive modem rental policy, I have been unable to use the modem which I purchased (to avoid the rental). When I cancelled the installation, Comcast had already transferred my phone service to them and I had to spend extensive time with AT&T to get them back as a carrier and to avoid losing my phone number as AT& T indicated Comcast now owned that number."
1,Comcast has been unable to correct a computer issue for months. My online bill pay account access was blocked by them(a fact they refused to accept. I then followed their web page instructions on how to restore it. In doing so I made an error and quickly notified them that I did. I was told it would take 24 hours to fix and it wasn't a major problem. Lie number 1. 72 hours later I still could not get into my account. When I contacted them again they stated it now take 48 hours and be no problem. Which meant they hadn't done anything the first time . Lie number 2. Now the time went from 24 to 48 hours . Lie number 3. Each time I was shuffled around from call center to call center to eventually the chat help. Which is really no help. 72 hours later the problem still was not cured.  I work from online. This time nothing was done. Another lie # 4. Again the phone shuffle. Again the  passing of the buck to the chat line. This time I refused that.Luckily I found an agent willing to talk to me and work with me or so I thought. He acted me and talked to the chat line people. He too was ready to   explode from the incident. He made promises to follow up and call me and have others call me.... more lies. In truth Comcast hadn't worked on it in every incident. I finally had to send letters threatening to sue before things happened. Then to top it all off when they did the work they it twice requiring me to go back and refill the forms twice to get my account activated.  Then today I go to use my computer and my services had been cut off. I then had to waste another morning trying to get some answers. I was told I could not talk to a supervisor when I had talked to one during previous headaches. More lies. The constant lies has left me wondering what can I trust from these people? I'm still waiting to hear back from a supervisor. Not having access to make payments was costing me a fortune. Lost time was losing me a fortune. It  may have lost me a few clients. Not having the ability to meet my schedules due to Comcast's inability to meet customers needs is an atrocity.
1,"Email went out on Sunday 11/30 at 1:00.  I called in a tech call.  I was told that technician would call me back by 5:00.  They did not.  I called back again at 6:03 and talked to Dustin.  No idea when it would be fixed - 24 - 72 hours.  On Monday, 12/1 3:54 a call came to me that it was fixed.  At 4:47 it was not working.  I called back to tech support and talked with Josh.  He assured me they were working on it.  Tuesday, 12/2 it worked intermittently and was working at 10:00 p.m. on 12/2.    When I got up on 12/3 at 6:00 AM it wasn't working.  I couldn't even log in.  I tried Forgot Your Password and it wouldn't take my secret question.  I called and they said it would be fixed today.  No message was on my machine when I arrived home at 4:45 PM and still could not log in. I called back.  They changed my password.    About 15 minutes later, I tried to change the password back to MY password and forgot what they set it to, so I called back.  Colby told me that they couldn't tell me what they just set my password to and that they had changed mny password 11 times within the past few days and could not change it again for FIVE days.  I have NO OPTIONS BUT TO WAIT FIVE MORE DAYS - a total of EIGHT days with no email.  I asked to speak to his boss Tony who was nasty and would not budge on resetting my password.  APPARENTLY they keep NO NOTES on what THEY just changed my password to and would not override their default of 11 times to change it.I have an online store and cannot be notified of sales.  The stress of dealing with this situation has made my blood pressure go up to a danger level - extreme headaches and heart palpitations."
1,"My comcast internet connection keeps dropping. I have to re-start the router approx. 20 times in a day. Then i called up for support and a technician was sent in. He checked all the connections to my home and found out that the in-coming frequency from the building cable was low, so he repaired that and also fixed up my Wireless connection. (dont know why the Initial comcast techincian didnt make a Wireless connection in the first place)  Anyways, its back to the same old story of rebooting the router...The connection is down again. "
1,"My Comcast High Speed Internet connection is not working from last two days and i have given complaint on Saturday Night(28th November).They said it will take 3 days to fix this issue.I called thrice to the custmoer service, and the way of response is not at all good from them.  The Week end was completely wasted and disappointed a lot."
1,"I contacted comcast back on sept 25,2008, in regards to payments not being credited to my account over 720.00 worth.  First they said 36 hours, then it became 72 hours.  Then they asked for faxes regarding bank statements, showing the payments, I have faxed/emailed/called everyday trying to get this resolved.  You can never reach the a/r dept, they have to be emailed and then they'll return your phone call. During this whole process they have shut down my account every other week, thus burning up their cable box and router.  We sent in payments to help them figure out where the payments went.  To this day November 29,2008 still not resolution, no call back and no credits.  Amazing we did everything we were asked faxing emailing over 50 times the info that they requested, still nothing.  I have let all my co-workers/friends/relatives know never to do business with comcast again.  They are now switching to a company that has a customer service.  I hope this helps many other possible future customers know that this is not the company for service. There are too many other companies out there to provide these services.Loss of work due to no internet services"
1,"My Comcast Internet went out about 9 days ago and after 10 or more attempts, they still have not fixed the problem.  Their call center just keeps telling me lies that the Line Tech will come out to fix it, but he never shows up.  Every time I call they act as thought it is the first time reporting the problem.  When I ask for a supervisor they just put me on hold.  They have hung up on me twice.  Comcast needs to be dismantled because it is a developing monopoly that is causing a disservice to the consumer. I have not been able to use my Internet banking, get my email, nor anything else related to Internet."
1,My email has been down for 6 day. Called Comcast on Monday 11-24-08. They tired to send me an email and it got sent back to them. They put in a work order and told me it would take 24 to 48 hours to fix. It been over 48 hours and it is still down. when I called them back they told me it can take up to 48 hours to fix.
1,Wireless connection keeps dropping. Call for help and follow their prompts and wind up repeatedly at the wrong department then a person sends you to a wrong department and so on.  Inability to use the service I am PAYING for on a daily basis.
1,"My business is a customer of Comcast.  Ever since they upgraded to their new email service, we have been unable to download our emails to our Server using Outlook.  I have made many phone calls to customer service.  All the techs tell me is We don't support servers so this is your problem.  Apparently losing my business is not their problem either.  I am unable to get to a tech who know how to help me.  In fact, a tech today hung up on me.  Clearly, Comcast has not done anything to improve customer services, all hype to the contrary.Our clients are unable to contact us, and we do not know if there is a message for us because we cannot get into our email."
1,"I am complaining about the new SmartZone as well as general internet service. Believe me, there is nothing smart about SmartZone--every action can take minutes to perform, so reading and replying to email is at a snail's pace. Sometimes it just won't respond at all, like to reply all. This has been going on for over 3 weeks. At about the same time, our internet in general slowed down also. Pages take forever to open, so surfing the web is not an option. When I contacted them via email they acknowledged problems with SmartZone. When I finally couldn't take it anymore and called them today, I would get disconnected after routing thru their system--this happened 4 times before I finally hit the right digit that didn't just say thank you, goodbye. The person I finally got to also tried to tell me email was a free service, so they would not give any refunds for that. As far as I'm concerned email and internet go hand in hand. I'm running my email thru comcast.net, which is the internet.  We've also had TV signal problems, not able to get a bunch of channels and others freezing up all the time--one guy came out and couldn't figure anything out--finally said we needed a booster--which we have to pay for of course. I declined, and lo and behold, a couple weeks later the channels miraculously started coming in again. Everest is putting cable in in our area right now, and I will be switching as soon as I can. Frustration, not being able to get the shopping, contacts etc that I needed, high blood pressure! Thank goodness this is not a work situation."
1,"http://www.spamhaus.org/query/bl?ip=76.27.67.151. Comcast claims unlimited access yet the force us their clients to use their SMTP server, which the limit to 10Mb per email. We send emails that are over 100mb every day. How can they control my email usage, and force me to use their SMTP?I do Multi-Milion Dollar deals as a Commercial Loan Broker. them doing this causes me to lose money hourly"
1,"I signed up for High-speed Intern and Digital Voice on 09/23/08. Before Comcast came out to hook this up I had been able to turn on my computor and work off line. I had the internet discounted so I could have the comcastInternet conected.When the person that hooked all this up handed me the phone to talk to the lady on the other end. He left, did not show me how to use the internet or the digital voice mail. I went to turn on my coputor and nothing. It would not turn on. Now I can not even get on to the computor. I called right away and they said they would send some one out on 09/27/08. He said he really did not know much about computors. I don't have the money to go out and buy a new computor.I know it was working when they came to hook it up. What do I do know. I have lost work that I was doing. This was on 09/27/08 to this date 11/14/08 I do not have asscess to the internet. Help!Not able to print pictures that I need for Insurance comapny of car. Used digital camera. Husband not able to order parts needed for work on this car. Not able to receive billing information or e-mails from prospective buyers of car."
1,"For extended periods of time  over  several years, I have experienced  excessive modem disconnections, excessively slow speeds, pixelated  video on my television service, and gross incompetence and lack of concern on the part of the Comcast  service department to resolve the issues. Rest assured that one area of the company's infrastructure seems to work very well; it's billing!The representative simply regurgitates the scripted mantra,  stay home and  an installer will be out to look at the problem. For at least 4 years I have been enduring this lackadaisical, non-theoretical  approach to problem resolution, to no avail. If one wonders why I haven't switched to another broadband provider, the answer is quite simple; My profession as a Systems Engineer requires me to have broadband connectivity and Comcast is the only broadband service provider in the Chicago area. My business suffers along with my ability to perform my work functions. I literally have to go to the local library to work. I have a web presence and and email alias which is non-reachable and not reliably publishable. I have lost customer confidence and  customers as a result of not being able to establish viable communications links with tier one customers."

In the past few months my Comcast Internet has been down more than 20 times!  I hardly get through a day without some kind of problem.  Today we received our bill and there was an extra $40 dollars tacked on the bill for Starz.  We have never had Starz nor have we ever asked for it.  We called and had to wait and wait.  The wait time is terrible as are the techs.   The lady finally determined that there was an error? and she was giving us credit as if we were receiving some kind of reward.
When my Internet system is down it is not unusual for the company to send a person out who will tell me he knows nothing about the Internet and that he only works on cable television.  The Internet techs blame the linemen and the linemen blame the techs.  On may occasions when I have reported a problem it is not unusual for the person with whom I am talking to tell me the local techs dont know what they are doing.
From the first day we joined Comcast to the present time we have perfect payment.  You better believe they check to see if you are a good paying customer.  Once I reached a person in upper level management and he told me that they could not afford to lose customers with perfect payment.  He said they spent too much time running down equipment from people who moved and took equipment with them and were behind in their payments.I pay well over $125 dollars a month for cable and Internet and that is a LOT of money for a retired schoolteacher!  Yet, I have had techs show up and give my computer and lines to my computer a cursory look and tell me I would be better off with Dish.  Once when I demanded that something be done the guy told me to QUIT Comcast and leave them alone!

1,"As soon as I can I'm getting rid of Comcast. I'm so tired of the run around and being passed from one billing associate to another. On Oct 15 I called to have my high speed internet downgraded. I just lost my job and I need to cut back. As soon as I got off the phone I went to my computer to refresh the page and got a limited or no connection error. I called back and the tech tried to renew my IP address online. No luck. They sent out a tech who spent several hours trying and left saying it was my ethernet card and I needed to replace it. I told him the computer was working fine until I downgraded. He said these things happen. He said he wasn't going to charge me for the service call because he wasn't sure if that really was the problem.I replaced the ethernet card, still no connection, so I took my computer to a computer repair shop. There was no problem with my computer there. So I brought it home and hooked it back up, still no connection. Another Comcast tech came out and a couple hours later told me it was my computer. Someone had told me once that McAfee, that is provided by Comcast had blocked their IP address. So I uninstalled it. Viola' I had internet. After all that and 2 weeks with no computer. I called the tech back and he sid to call Comcast and tell them what happened. They said they would deduct 2 weeks from my bill. I just got my bill. $164.00. They billed me for the high speed performance that I downgraded from, charged me for the service call that the first guy said I wouldn't be charged for, charged me for a service call the billing associate couldn't explain. Okay I got all that taken care of and I've yet to see the 2 weeks deducted from my bill. I was passed around from one billing associate to another and finally I called again the next day after my bill was reduced to $91.16. The automated voice message said it was $115. I called and he said he would disreguard that bill. Told me to add up the $54.00 cable and $24.95 internet, $3.00 modem rental and with the taxes it's suppose to total $91.16?? What are we suppose to do when you can't get them to correct your bills?"
1,We pay 50 dollars a month for internet.  The speed is terrible.  For what they're charging they need to upgrade their equipment.  Soon as we find another provider we're done with Comcast.  They are charging us almost 200 a month for tv and internet.  They just raised their prices and each HD cable box alone is 9 bucks a month.  We're going to change from that too.We do all our banking online.  The speed of transfer per the connection is so bad its like using a dial-up.  This is not acceptable.  I also work from home.  Our tv cable has even been locking up.

1,I can not stand the new email smart zone. This so complicated. The letters are small and it is not user friendly. Considering going else where if not fixed soon.
1,"    This new format for comcast is really  bad. It really doesn't work well at all.      Is there anyway  to use the old format for E-mail?  The nam is smart zone=bad   E-mails not complete, disappear and   screwey things that happen."
1,"My internet service drops in and out. I called comcast who claimed there was no problem. They lied. Days later, after reinstalling all kinds of software etc... and repeatedly calling, they admitted there was a weak signal. three different operators said they couldn't send a tech for 5 days.Molly suggested there was an outage in my area which explained the delay in a techie. She wouldn't say how they defined an outage. 
1) they can sure as hell get a tech out to install a new customer.
2) they don't tell the truth.3) their service is bad. Their lying is horrible.intermitten loss of email and interet for the better part of 10 days3) their service is bad. Their lying is horrible.intermitten loss of email and interet for the better part of 10 days"
1,"I am a Comcast customer in North Fort Myers Florida. I have cable tv and internet access. I've been reading where Comcast has been accused of throttling down broadband to limit download speeds and control how much you can download. I believe their comment was that they aren't doing this anymore. Well, let me tell you, they are here in SW Florida. We are supposed to have speeds here of over 5mb/s. I download PDF's from local county and city governments for construction projects in the area. (I'm a retired construction PM). I do this to keep my neighbors and family informed on projects that may impact them. I just this minute tried to down load a PDF file that was 5.2MB in size. Down load time was estimated at 11 minute and it took all of that. THAT IS THROTTLING!  This is not right. I don't do all that much. I pay for a certain speed and I ought to get what I pay for. They just don't care what they do and they also don't care a spit about public opinion because they are so big a monopoly."
1,"I have been without email for 10 days.  I was supposed to migrate to SmartZone, but somehow my account is not accessible.  Filed complaint 72 hours ago, checked back after 48 hours, still nothing.  They called today, reset my password.  That is not the problem!  I just called again and was told my call could not be answered because of high call volume.  This is outrageous.Fortunately I do not run a business through this email account.  When I was in software support, I would be fired for this time of support!"
1,"I have had Comcast Broadband home service since its inception and have been with the company since it bought it fro AT&T and two previous owner before them and I pay $35.95 for what once was the fastest speed and since they began altering and changing the format of their pages, I have gone from lightning fast for years, to a crawl..formerly 22,000 mbps to 1200 mbps.They do not respond with technical help or offer excuses or reasons and why it is so screwed up. I do stock trading and I have lost a very large sum of money in the past few months because of not being able to put in a buy and sell bids and am really ****** off as are the 30 or local people I know who are having the same problem. It also caused my computer to crash in an attempt to fix it. They are incompetent and have been really rude and hung up on me after keeping me waiting each time 15 minutes on hold. Stock market losses, missed plane reservations,and financial planning which depended on internet speed."
1,"For almost 2 years, I have had trouble with my internet connection... they would send someone out and for a week or so it would seem ok and then it would go out again sometimes for days... I would call again and have to start from scratch. I finally switched to AT&T... I asked Comcast to discontinue my service, but found that they were still charging me. Apparently, you get charged the full monthly amount till you turn in the modem. Comcast refused to refund any amount even though they agreed to refund my account for one month when I cancelled... so, whatever... Comcast just sucks."
1,"I started working as a remote agent for a company, but in order to do my job proficiently, the software required a cable or dsl consistent internet speed of 4.0 or higher. However, I am only receiving a speed within the 1-3 speed even though I am paying for 6.0. When I called the rep..went through and had me delete this and that and disable stuff like the firewall and virus software etc. Okay, I know how to do this stuff and had already been doing most of this every time prior to connecting to the work program. I however do not feel that I should have to disable my antivirus and firewall (something that protects my personal information and my computer from hackers, and virus) in order to receive a higher speed I am already paying for, which didn't even fix the problem. Are they going to buy me a new computer when I have to disable my protection services in order to get online in the first place..I think not! Are they going to pay the bills or repair any damage that may be caused because someone was able to hack into my computer and steal my personal information..I think not!When they finally scheduled a tech to come out..he could of course find nothing wrong..I was told that due to the powerboost they no longer guarantee a speed of 6.0 or 8.0 etc. That with the powerboost, if someone in the area downloads a file, such as music, an application, game, or is even playing a high speed internet game of any large amount in size, it kicks in the powerboost for them and takes any available bandwidth there is, which therefore lowers your connection speed.Okay, I don't care about the powerboost, quite frankly it does not benefit me the least. I hardly download or upload music, pictures, games etc. So I was happy with the consistent guaranteed speed in which I was paying for in the first place. So, how is this powerboost fair for most general consumers? I'm sure I am not the only one out here who feels the same. Powerboost is geared mostly for those who play games etc. not the everyday person who uses the internet for work and everyday basic home functions. They need to somehow separate the two, and give those that want the guaranteed speed in which they are paying for, and are happy to be without the powerboost, their speed back, and those that want the powerboost, then let them fight with each other over the bandwidth and speeds all in their own little group.Anyway the tech, was really nice and changed out all the cables etc. with new ones..and ran all kinds of tests and said that my speeds are right where they should be, and with the powerboost, it is within excellent range.So, that tells me that they have capped my speed at 3.0, and then when someone else kicks in their powerboost or there is a lot of high traffic, it then kicks me down more to an even lower speed."
1,"Re: 1) Illegal Slamming of my internet account by switching from EarthLink to Comcast without notification or approval. 2) Arbitrarily changing monthly internet service charges for each of the last 5 months without my knowledge or consent. I subscribed to EarthLink to provide internet services since 2006 or perhaps before. EarthLink internet services were provided by the local Houston cable franchise, TCI cable which was purchased by Comcast. Earlier this year I was switched from being an EarthLink customer to a Comcast customer without my knowledge or consent. As the monthly bill has always come from the actual service provider, TCI and then Comcast after the buyout, there was no way for me to know this change had occurred as it was normal to receive a bill from Comcast as Comcast is the physical provider for the EarthLink service.It was only in April that I learned I was a Comcast customer when my mail server was not working and both EarthLink and Comcast told me I was not their customer, even though I was on automatic payment and had always paid my bill on time. Eventually Comcast told me I was now their customer even though I did not want this switch. I was told I had no choice in the matter.After being told I had been switched to a Comcast customer, against my will, the next 2 monthly billing statements (ending 6/4/08 and 7/4/08) were the same monthly fee of $41.95/month plus $1.40 for taxes, surcharges and fees as they had been prior to the unauthorized switch of provider. The next bill dated 7/5/08 for the period of 7/5/08-8/4/08 increased the monthly service charge by 52% to $63.81, added $1.99 for a one-time change of service and increased taxes and fees to $3.50. There was absolutely no notice of the change, no conversation, no approval, nothing - simply a dramatically increased bill.On 7/17/08 I called Comcast and spoke with Beverly about the situation. She told me when I swapped modems (due to extremely inconsistent service) on 6/24/08 Comcast changed my plan. I was never told of any changes when I swapped the modem and had no reason to believe anything would be any different as I had swapped modems several times before at the exact same TCI/Comcast location when EarthLink was my provider. I told Beverly about my normal rate of $41.95 per month and that was the only acceptable plan I would agree to. She told me they would make adjustment for the bill of 7/5/-8/4/08 in the next billing cycle and that my monthly rate going forward would be $41.95 - exactly as it had been for years.When I received the next bill (for 8/5-9/4/08) there was an adjustment that was quite confusing as the unpaid balance still showed as $26.28, but the bill showed a low monthly charge and a one-time credit that put the total somewhere in the ballpark of reason. The weird monthly charge, credit, and remaining previous balance on the bill made absolutely no sense to me, but again the total was somewhere where it should be.On 9/30/08 I spoke with Comcast to request credit for the 17 days of no service due to the hurricane and no electricity. I had not opened the bill dated 9/5/08 until AFTER the bill dated 10/5/08 as my mail had stacked up to several feet before and especially during the period after the hurricane where I had no electricity for 17 days. (I did open some mail during that time, but bills that are on automatic payment, such as the Comcast bill, are not a priority for me to review since I know they are automatically paid each month.) I opened the bill dated 10/5/08 on 10/11/08 and noticed the monthly charge of $48.30 and was upset as it was supposed to be $41.95 as per my telephone conversation and agreement with Comcast made on 7/17/08. Some credit was on the 10/5/08 bill, however considering the monthly charges was $48 and 17 days is OVER ½ of a month, I was not happy a credit of $18.68 had been applied as this was less than half of $41.95 let alone Comcast’s new charge of $48.30. I was also not happy about the monthly charge being $48.30 as it was not $41.95 as had been agreed on 7/17/08.At that point I opened the bill dated 9/5/08 and saw yet another amount billed for monthly service: $32.99. In reviewing 5 consecutive months bill the “Comcast High Speed Internet” charge went from $41.95, to $63.81, to $17.70, to $32.99 and finally to $48.30. Apparently Comcast seems to pick and choose which base charges it wants to charge and from which ones it wants to deduct each and every month.When I called and spoke to Mario at Comcast on 10/13/08 I was told I had been switched on 7/17/08 to a three month plan rate of $29.99. At no time was there any discussion on 7/17/08 of switching the plan from anything than a straight $41.95/month each and every month. I told Mario of my discussion with Beverly and we had both agreed that the initial plan, which was the only plan to which I had EVER agreed, was what the bill should be. Mario put me on hold several times and stated his supervisor said there was nothing he could do as he told me “I had accepted the changes since I hadn't complained earlier”.I called again on 10/15/08 and spoke with Alana after reviewing the documents and noting that I had called on a timely basis as it was with 48 hours of when I discovered the problem. I told Alana I could not be expected to be a fortune teller to understand the changes in the bill as the total amount shown on the front of the bill for the “Comcast High Speed Internet” amount had changed SIGNIFICANTLY up and down each and every month for 5 consecutive months. When Alana became aware the only thing that would make me happy was to put me back at the $41.95 to which we had agreed on 7/17/08, she transferred me to the retention department. After being on hold, I was disconnected, but Alana did call back and eventually got Randal in the retention department. I spoke one sentence (I’m tired of the crap from the billing department by getting billed different amounts 5 months in a row) and Randal hung up. I sincerely doubt the disconnect was accidental. I sent an email complaint on 10/16/08 which recommended calling a local 713 number, rather than the 800 number. I called and spoke to Denise, then to Claudia in retention and they refused to fix the problem only offering different promotional rates. I hope you consider: A) revoking Comcast’s cable franchise; B) Assess civil penalties for the unlawful behavior of Comcast; and C) access criminal penalties for the unlawful behavior of Comcast as you have the authority to do so."
1,"About the same time every single night for about 2 months, I have noticed that my internet gets a slow or faint connection to the point to where I can't browse or surf the internet. I have been calling Comcast for 2 months about this and they send out a technician during the day when the speed is just fine. During the day I have absolutely no problems surfing the net. I don't download and I don't use bit torrents. I have an online business and I have to keep tabs on it throughout the day and correspond via email. I think they are controlling the surf times on the net. I am so frustrated with them that I will be canceling my service with them and going straight to BellSouth. It's a damn shame that I pay this company $65.00 a month for high speed access only to get treated like this."
1,I pay over $55.00 a month for my comcast internet service!! I switched from AOL for $22.00 a month. What a waste. I sit and sit waiting for even the Comcast page to load. All they want to do is send a technician to my house and CHARGE ME to tell me that nothing is wrong. I HATE COMCAST.
1,"For 6 years, I've worked from my home using Comcast Internet service to update and maintain several web sites for my home-based business. Then 3 weeks ago, updating the sites became almost impossible. I could connect easily (using Contribute), but saving a change (just correcting a misspelled word) took anywhere from 5 minutes to 35 minutes. The same thing happened on sites that were hosted on private servers and on a site hosted with Go Daddy and Earthlink.After much research (and talking to technical experts at the server company), the diagnosis was that Comcast was blocking my upload. When I contacted Comcast to report the problem, I was told by the rep that Comcast was monitoring people's usage and blocking usage for those they considered 'businesses'. I was 'urged' to sign up for their Business service (which is ONLY $40 more a month that what I pay now). They did agree to send out a service technician, who ran a new cable to replace the old one we had, but the problem still existed. He, too, told me what Comcast was doing about blocking service and urged me to call their business service department. My business literally has come to a stop. To do any website work, I go to a neighbor's house, use their computer and their Comcast service. Apparently, Comcast hasn't 'monitored' their usage as of yet. This seems criminal to me or unfair business practices... truly bait and switch."
1,"I have been without internet service for a week and have had unusable service for over two weeks now. With Comcast, a regular technician has to be scheduled to come out before maintenance can come out and fix any issues outside the house. Maintenance was scheduled for the 1st of October, but they never fixed the issue. I had called the support number every day to find out what was going on and they kept telling me they were working on it.Today, I called them and was told that maintenance for the repair was cancelled and they just put in their notes issue not fixed. I called the first technician and his supervisor to find out what happened and why. All I get is their voicemail immediately and still no answers to my polite messages that I have left for both of them. So now they have to call another technician so they can schedule another maintenance person to come out to fix the issue; if that ever happens. This Monopoly MUST stop! Where are you Verizon FIOS?! One thing is known: I or no one else here will not have to worry about breaking Comcast's new acceptable use policy."
1,"I was using my wife computer and notice it seemed very slow I had the fellow that take cars of her computer come over and look it over he did a speed test on it and said the computer was ok but the comcast cable was twice as slow as dsl, he suggested to my wife to contact you guys which i know that she has not done so I am, he also said the trunk line is coming out of WA."
1,"I received email from COMCAST.   What hits me is that they are now setting limites on the amount of bandwidth usage allowed, which means they will start charging when the limits are set, because, they claim, less than 1% of their customers exceed the new limits.  I quote '... because a fraction of one percent of our customers use such a disproportionate amount of bandwidth every month that they may degrade the online experience of other customers.? This is pure PR speak.  So, for the sake of  a fraction of one percent?, they are going to set limits on 99% of the consumers! I can't believe that the fraction of one percent that are using excessive bandwidth are affecting this company's bottom line and I know that these 1% ers are not capable of and do NOT degrade the online experience.? If COMCAST's network servers are so fragile, then we have bigger problems than anyone was ever aware!   This fraction of one percent? is only a justification to set the consumer up for future additional usage charges that are sure to follow!"
1,"HS Internet service quality has degraded to a point where it is not usable.  There have been occassional slow periods, particularly weekends when I try to handle my online needs.  However, these have gotten even more frequent.  Comcast claims there are no problems or upgrades going on, but they are doing something to cause issues that come and go.  Google will load sometimes and even run a search, but web pages more complex frequently fail during these outages.  E-mail won't function.  Can't pay bills or do homework that is a must have.  I'm going back to DSL and suggest anyone else who can do so.  Don't give Comcast any more power because they aren't servicing our basic needs."
1,"   for over 3 weeks my internet service has been down for the majority of the day , in the middle of the night it usually comes up, first i try to schedule an appt and they refuse because there are problems in the area and tell me to keep calling back because they will not schedule a service appt if there are problems in the area after several calls I insist on speaking to a manager to schedule an appt. they do then cancel it automatically because there were problems in the area that were resolved they did leave me an automatied phone message stating to call back if my problems still exists. I call back demanding the still send out the service person between the hours of 4-7 pm as promised twice they tell me they are contacting the dispatch office and someone will call me back in 5-10 minutes and they will issue me a credit they did not call nor was I issued a credit, the third phone call the man tells me they do not work after 5 and I would have to reschedule, I do for Tuesday 4-7pm, Monday I call to check to make sure there is no problems and the recording tells me I am scheduled for that day between 1-4 while I am sitting in my office some how my appt for the following day was cancelled on Saturday and rescheduled for Monday they tried to say I did it, We were not home over the week end. Reschedule for yesterday, keep calling to verify the appt has not been cancelled and the recording states a repair man will be out to my home between 4-7pm   6:30 no call no service man I call customer service to be told they tried to call my house at 2pm and 3:10 since no one answered they cancelled my service. call again. I told them I was home sitting by the phone from 3:25 on.  I request to speak to a supervisor who changes the story to include a phone call at 4:09. promises me an email to verify the following a 25.00 credit 19.96 per month for internet service for 6 months and a repair person to day 4-7pm. so far no email and I have been calling their 800 number every hour to make sure they haven't cancelled. they have the worse customer service I have ever dealt with thanks to their monopoly on cable what choice do we have  I request to speak to a supervisor who changes the story to include a phone call at 4:09. promises me an email to verify the following a 25.00 credit 19.96 per month for internet service for 6 months and a repair person to day 4-7pm. so far no email and I have been calling their 800 number every hour to make sure they haven't cancelled. they have the worse customer service I have ever dealt with thanks to their monopoly on cable what choice do we have "
1,"I have had nothing but nightmares since signing up with Comcast for high speed and phone service apprx 6 months ago.When I first signed up for service I only had cable and the lady I talked with said she would give me the triple play 33.00 each (cable, phone and high speed) however I never got charged for that, also I was told that my directory assistance calls would be free because I'm legally blind, they gave me a fax number to fax in the info... I NEVER received that up to present... I have been in the hospital off and on for 6 months due to health issues and since I could not see the bill I never knew how high the bill was.I just sent payment in by my son. When I orginally signed up for the service I asked that my phone numbers be non published it took 2 months to get that corrected the supvervisor kept calling saying it was fixed, however whenever I called from certain phones the operator kept giving out the number. Yes, it took 2 months to get that corrected. The supervisor said they would credit me for that, however I never received a credit. I canot afford to pay 200.00 a month for this service. My friends are leaving Comcast due to the poor quality service. Mr. Roberts no one should have to go through this, however if you don't pay your bill they amazingly cut if off fast. I should get credit for months of poor service. Someone should be able to pull my records and see the turmoil I've gone through. You call customer service they won't let  you speak to a supervisor. Also I think the MPSC and BBB should look into these matters. My friends are leaving Comcast due to the poor quality service.

1,"July 19th the high speed internet service went down in my area for more than 48 hours.  Since then it has been up and down, but more down than anything else.  I have internet phone, so if I leave to go somewhere and the phones go out and my children have an emergency..how will they let anyone know? They can't.  This keeps my husband from doing the online parts of his college classes, and is effecting his grade and the best they could give me was a $6.00 refund for no service.  I to had been told a technician would come to my house and no one ever showed up.  Oh yeah and the customer service advised me to get in my car and find a wi-fi hotspot if I wanted internet...which is funny because thats what I thought I WAS PAYING THEM FOR?  We have no other choice for internet service in the area either,  I wish the cable industry had NEVER been deregulated, because they have us bent over a barrel and since they are the only providers they have no reason to provide good customer service.Time lost in school and being able to reply to emails from my customers"
1,"My Comcast internet doesn't seem to be working.  I cannot send out.  Please help?  Do I need to do something?  It has been this way ever since I turned it on and I feel like I am losing my 19.99 time, which is only for 4 months.  thank you."
1,They refuse to put the price of there hight spped internet to $20.00 a month.  
1,"I tried for about 2 years to cancel Comcast commercial Internet account and switch to residential. Only after I complained to the BBB could I even get an employee who knew how to handle the situation. I wanted 1 year of refund of the difference in price. They offered 3 months, which in my view is them admitting they made the mistake in the first place.I was charged $210.88 every month, but should have been charged their residential rates of $50 or so. This went on for years. I was willing to settle for 1 year's refund."
1,"I moved from Reston to Arlington and continued my service with Comcast for Internet, Cable and phone.  When it was installed in March 2008 it took the technician two days to get it installed.  After about a week it started freezing and not working properly.  We ignored it and finally called in April to get a technician to come out and fix it.  One came out and switched out the boxes 3 times because each box he tried to install did not work.  On the 3rd try he finally got them working however, a week later the box shut off completely.  I called to get them to come back out and fix it and they did not show up for the appointment.  They issued me a credit and rescheduled the appt.  Once again they did not show up.  This has been going on since May.  I keep scheduling appointments and they continue to not show up either because their car broke down, they said they called when they never did or they are unable to make it during the window given.  I have scheduled 8 appointments since May and still cannot get a technician to come out and fix the issue.  I was told by several customer service reps that they issued credits for every appt missed.  I just spoke to a supervisor who said she had no record of these credits.  I've also received a bill for 160 for service I have not been receiving.  My cable doesn't even turn on.  The technicians have been giving their reps false information about calling me prior to the visit when I never receive a phone call.  At this point I'm getting ready to cancel my service with them however, I cannot find another provider in my area so I have no other options now.  I've never spoken to an understanding representative and I've been told several times they are short on technicians.  This might be why they have not shown up to the last 8 scheduled appointments.  At this point, I feel justified in not paying the fees because I have no working service.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm being charged for service that I'm not getting and faulty equipment.  Also, I am extremely stressed out and frustrated because I'm not getting any where. I spend too many hours on the phone with Comcast trying to resolve this as well as too many hours waiting to find out if they will show up."
1," I told Comacast to lower my Internet service to low speed from high speed to save money. They told me on phone that they did it. For next month I was billed less money. The month after that I was charged higer again. So, I called them to find out why. They told me that nobody ever reduced my service to lower speed and i did not check my bills properly. I did not remember what date I called them to reduce the charge. (if I dig my phone records,it will show though). So now because I don't remeber the date I told them to reduce service, I am made to pay higher prices  from that point onwards including last months difference!( they say that they put multiple product discount which I did not had, how in the world I know their billing terminology?)       6 months ago they were charging me for DVR services on cable when I never asked them for DVR. The technician who came to install said he had only DVR reciever not regular one. Was it my fault he did not had regular reciever.     They are the most unethical company in the world. Cheating and dishonesty is their motto.For cable services I was overcharged for multiple months extra money for DVR reciever. $11/month vs $5.95/month.    For internet services, I am charged for higher product of $57.95 vs low speed product of appx $39. (for 2 months)   In both cases, I got the products they charged me for. But I did not ordered them. I ordered lower products."
1,   I had road runner online service for years one year ago I wrote a letter of complaint about there prices and service well I just canceled it and they want 19.95 to pick there modem that they deliveried to my home when i bought service now the get all the dollar company is so cheap that they can not even pick up there equipment unless they get paid for it I personally hope DIRECTV and Att bury your high prices and put you on the street corner with a sign that reads used to be cable company exe. but now i need your money so i can eat.
1,"I am a network engineer by trade. In my locality Comcast is the predomonant carrier for cable television and broadband. On the television reception side of things the amount of compression they apply to video signals is really beginning to show up on almost all non-HD channels as blockiness. On HD channels, there are often interruptions in the audio portion.  Broadband is much worse. I see average ping times to my default route of 500ms, Domain Name Servers (DNS) that are unreachable, connection resets when trying to retrieve emails or download Windows updates. Throughput, on the rare occasion when things are working may approach 4 Mbps (which is what they advertise), but is typically hovering around a sputtering, intermittent 300 Kbps. In my opinion, this level of service does not constitute broadband.  Repeated calls yield little to no results other than the suggestion that I unplug my cable modem and reconnect it. When I get more insistent about problem solving, then they tell me that they will need to send a technician to my premises to check my connections. I ask them how this will help my Comcast afflicted neighbors who are all experiencing the same problems. At this point they tell me that I should talk to a higher level support technician, and after being on hold for ten minutes all I receive is a click and a dial tone. Repeating this process yields similar results. It is futile.Comcast is expensive at approximately $150.00 per month for a TV and internet package."
1,When calling Comcast local they tried to blame it on my browser.
1,"I have called 6 times and been on hold for up to 30 minutes and they say you must leave a message then they hang up.  I need to speak with them when I have some technical support as I know nothing in addition business is really rough and I cannot shut down during our brief season or tie myself up or my phone lines.  I am so frustrated and of course this is the cable company and I have no recourse. Patriot Media has been our provider for years and we never had a problem and the service was excellent. How do I get them to cooperate, this is my business I need help. They have already shut down my VPN for half a day for them to update, during business hours, this little switch will cost $ 350.00 plus downtime for my business, there is no telling how much business I will lose due to their changeover."
1,"I had a appointment set for 8-12 on 5/12/08 and never had any body arrive, I called to ask why no one was here and they said that the technician was outside after looking outside I told the rep that their was no one outside, she indicated that they were going to get a part and would be here at my house within 20 minutes, I stood outside and waited with nothing, I even had lawn people in the yard for these hours and they even were looking out for the technician.   I called back and spoke to Latoya and she told me she was the manager and she fixed the mistake and was sending someone out to do the job today 5/13, well needless to say 4:30PM came around and I started calling they told me that the appointment was set for 5/14 1-4PM, now I have taken 1 entire day off work to get my service corrected and now your Scheduling Dept, took it into their own to reschedule me with out my knowledge, heck I have had all the neighbors on the look out, but Nothing.   Now they expect me to take another day off for their error. I am writing a letter to the BBB the state and the local media to address these horrible consumer relations department, I am also contacting the investors on this site to share the horrible experience I have had again with your company, if you look at the original order a year ago this same crap happened and I was credited for the months it took to get service, this is a clear indication that your company is not doing the right thing as far as service and knowledge of the procedures at hand and not even making the money I as a consumer am willing to pay for true service.   Yet another horrible experience with Comcast and to think I pay you guys monthly for this type of service, I feel that maybe I should take your equipment outside and slam it on the porch and order from a company who cares about their consumers.   I pay you guys 130 a month and the internet connection is bad so this is your error not mine, but I am the one paying for this by having to deal with your horrible Service representatives at the Woodridge Il. location.   I spoke to Latoya who clearly lied about the reschedule only to get me off the phone and to a manager by the name of Arlo & Andrew, Andrew just kept putting back in queue and telling me that it was my fault! This guy needs to be fired based on the fact that he kept hanging up on me! And to think that you guys can go in and put notes in place to make it look as if you have done your part when all these validations are bogus!   I then called yet again in hopes of getting a different competent supervisor and I spoke to Markus and he was the only one that tried to help correct the mistake and he clearly stated that the technician missed the appointment and told me he would follow up tomorrow, so now I am taking another day of work and I feel backed into the corner.   I hate the service at COMCAST and I will take the time to share this poor service outcome to all that may make a difference, this is clearly a waste of everybodys time!  I am writing you in hopes that this information can be taken to the top and addressed,Lost a full days work and now the want me here again tomorrow!"
1,i cannot check e-mail during the day.I work at night so during buisness hours I surf the internet and catch up with e-mail.When I try to connect to the e-mail server I get a default message that states cannot connect to inbox at this time try again later.This is a home use connection so I get bumped from the server by buisness customers.I should not have to contine paying full price for internet if I do not get full service.
1,"First off both my wife and myself run our businesses' from our home. We have an at home office with faxes and 4 computers.  We need internet and of course phone service.  We have Comcast Cable, Internet, phones & television.  We have trouble with all of it and cannot get anything resolved with Comcast at all.    I am CONSTANTLY being kicked off line right in the middle of something.  Or, kicked off during the middle of a phone call, if that is, I can actually get the phone call in, or out, in the first place!?   while on the phone, many times, I can hear the person on the other end however, they cannot hear me or visa versa.    Sometimes, we just simply get disconnected.  Boom!  Phone call ended.  Internet gone.  Sometimes, we can reconnect or redial, other times not.  Sometimes it's only for a few seconds, other times, for several minutes,  other times, the internet is a problem for an entire day.    I am told by Comcast, that the problem is NOT in my home. The problem is a Comcast problem.  So, that eliminates the need for anyone to have to enter my home yet, each time, they come over, check the same crap IN MY HOME, tell me the same thing and go away with nothing changed.  These problems with Comcast is a DAILY occurrence and usually it happens many times throughout the day!!!   This has been an ongoing issue with Comcast for well over a year!!  It has not gotten better and in fact, during the past few months has gotten considerably worse instead!    No matter what I do and no matter what they do or promise me, the problem has never even once been resolved.    They claim that a supervisor will be out to look at the problem and it will be fixed tomorrow.  I have as YET to have even seen ONE supervisor let alone, talk to one.    They send the same people come out that can do nothing but tell me the same thing.  You have to much power coming into your home and/or, not enough power going out.  The problem is NOT in your home, it is between the telephone lines and Comcast.  We will have it fixed immediately.  Yet, nothing is ever resolved.  It is so damn frustrating and time consuming it's pitiful!!  I am losing my ability to contact my clients and their ability to contact me. I am receiving complaints from them as well but, there isn't a thing I can do to prevent it.  I am positive that not all phone calls are reaching my home office.  No calls = no business...    We try sending faxes, get disconnected half way through.  I can't count the amount of time I've spent redoing an email because I got kicked off line or the amount of time I've wasted talking to these idiots from Comcast on the phone.  All, no to avail."
1,"I have return my modem and all to this office 4/24/08. I disconnected service with Comcast Hi Speed Internet as I sure would not pay $8.00 monthly to go on hold (not knowing when I'd be back, as asnowbird). [They] in fact owe me and yet you are still billing me.  No damage, just error in billing"
1,"On January 2, 2008, Comcast Service reps showed up because I was not receiving internet service.  They replaced the modem and restrung the cable from the box out front to the house, about 200 ft of cable.  In April, I called to complain about the cable not being buried.  They set up a service visit (unneccessary) for Good Friday.  Of course they never showed and when I called they said the appointment had never been made.  I explained my problem and, again, set up an appointment.  A rep came out and said yes, I needed to have the cable buried and that Miss Utility would show up soon.  It's now May 7, going on 5 months with the cable going diagonally across my yard making it difficult to mow.  A neighbor said he had to cut his 3 times before they came out and buried it but I can't do without the internet service since I work out of my home."
1,"On February 9, 2008, I talked to a representative. He tried to walked me through the connection process. It was not completed because I had the Wi-Fi connection. The agent I spoke with knew that I was not connected and so nothing was done since then.  But, I did receive a bill for services I never used.  I am very upset by Comcast reaction and most of all why are you charging me?  Your record show that my services was never connect so why am I being billed.  Businesses should not charged people for services that was never received. I don't understand. Please review my account. Your people need to understand also that people do not want or need to pay for services they do not receive. "
1,I am a teacher and need access for parent/teacher communication as well as using an online substitute teacher program.  My husband is a police officer and information is often sent to him via our email.  Not only is this a problem regarging our jobs but I should not have to pay for a service that is not being provided.
1,"This relates to attempting to disconnect service when I moved out of state.    In Early February, I called to cancel my internet account effective FEBRUARY 22, 2008.   Then I got a bill and called, because I had called to cancel, but was being charged.  I moved out of the house on February 22, 2008.  I expained this to the person with whom I spoke.  She told me don't worry.   She said they had recorded the disconnect with the February 22 effective date, but had not yet sent someone to the physical address yet to disconnect the service.  However, my Incorrect billing would be fixed as soon as THEIR TECHNICIANS went to do thier job!  I thought the issue had been resolved.  Appearently not.  Because  TODAY I got a NASTY & AGGRESSIVE voice mail message demanding I call to arrange to disconnect my service as new owners wanted to set-up their internet.  I HAD CANCELLED ALREADY!!  I called a SECOND TIME was told A SECOND TIME it would be addressed.  Instead I got hostility and still am being charged for services cancelled in a home I no longer own!  My decision now is not to use Comcast for either cable or internet here in Seattle.  Hopefully they won't screw with my credit.  However, as I have a bill with a past due (again for services twice cancelled in a home I no longer own) I don't put anything past them! I expect I will bet a hit on my credit report for not paying for service in a home I don't own.  Mostly, the consequence to date is frustration and hours of stress."
1,"I am a new customer and took cable TV services from Comcast in mid Jan 2008. Meanwhile I took Internet services through Comcast offers ($19.95/month) in the month of Feb 2008.   Problems: 1. I am still being charged for $42.95/month for internet. I was asked to submit the mail-in-rebate forms for the $19.95/m offer to start. In-spite of sending the mail-in-rebate to Comcast, I am being charged $42.95.   2. During the month of March, Comcast was upgrading the cables in my area and I was without internet service for 3 weeks in a row after the upgrade was completed. In-spite of regular follow-ups, no one was able to fix the problem. Only after escalating the issue, the issue was addressed. During these 3 weeks I have lost lot of time, peace of mind and money.  3. I was told that I'll not be charged for the duration I did not have the services, but I have the bill in my hand now and I do not see any discounts.  4. Whenever I call 1-800-comcast either the call is disconnected or they try to misguide me. had to disturb my friends during night because I had to send some emails. I use Vonage and I was without phone for 3 weeks. It was a huge risk as I did not have anyway to reach my pregnant wife at home. I had to travel every day to my office (in New York) even though I wanted to work from home when my wife was not feeling well. Every day follow-up with Comcast was painful and mental torture."
1,"I signed up for Comcast service through www.comcastoffers.com in July 2007.  I was promised three rebates for the following amounts:  $100, $30, & $50.  I mailed in the rebates (correctly filled out, I have copies) before Sept 1st.  I changed addresses after that, and provided the website my updated address on October 25th.  The company's records indicated that all three rebates were sent to my old address and marked as paid in their system.  However, I only received the $100 & $30 rebates.  The company stated they would reissue the $50 rebate on 12/10 in 6-8 weeks.  I still have not received the rebate.  I just submitted another help ticket to their website, and will be sending them a certified demand letter.   I have not been paid $50, and I will have to pay the cost for sending a certified letter."
1,"My internet service went out so we called Comcast. They were not able to get it back up from their office and sent a service tech.  He found the modem was bad and replaced it.  I just got my monthly bill and found I was charged a $32.99 service call fee. I was not told before the tech was sent out that there would be a charge if the modem was replaced nor did the tech tell me. I was told this is standard and they charge a fee if the modem is replaced.  To avoid paying the service call fee you either have to take the modem to Comcast or pay a monthly $3.00 protection plan fee.   Yes, that's right, pay Comcast $3.00 per month to avoid a service charge if the equipment you are renting from Comcast goes bad."
1,"I cancelled my High Speed Internet service with comcast in February 2008 and payment was fully made. However, comcast proceed to issue a bill for future services and any attempt to resolved it resulted in aggravation and payment demanded. "
1,"My son had his own apartment. For a birthday present I set him up with Comcast internet so he could do his college studies. My son has since joined the military and is in boot camp. I paid the bill off, but there was a credit due. The bills have gone to us the whole time, rather than to my son. Comcast is sending the credit amount to my son's address in his name. After speaking to two employees, one who said no problem, another who said it has to got go to my son (after waiting two weeks with no check.) Finally after 16 minutes on hold, a supervisor comes on the phone and says he'll see what he can do. Finally he comes back to say he can get the check to our house, but it has to be in my son's name. I asked why since my son has never paid the bill. They said he was set up as the account holder. Well of course he was, but WE paid the bill. It is OUR money to be refunded. IF my son was not at boot camp and going to be GONE for the next 6 YEARS, this would not be much of an issue. But he will not be around to sign the check that should not be issued to him in the first place. If I had been late on the payments the bill final bill would have been corrected. Of course they would have charged a late fee. Hmmm.The credit due back to us will not come to us. I don't know who gets to keep the money because my son doesn't live there anymore, but we who paid for it will not get the money without waiting for a mailing address, waiting for the check he was not supposed to get, to be signed and mailed back. By then it will be 4 months out. How many company checks are still valid after 3 months? Not many. It so ridiculous for such a small amount, but if they do this to lots of us, imagine how much money they get to keep?"
1,"I have been with comcast/roadrunner high speed internet for the last 4 years. However, in the past 6 months I have had terrible connection issues non-stop. I am sick of their customer service and high prices. I am making the switch to dsl and we will see how that goes. With comcast I would get intermitent connection nonstop..good luck to all that dont change. "
1,"We signed up for Comcast high speed internet. The tech that hooked the internet up at our house told us for signing up we would get ten free song downloads. When I tried to get information on where to get the downloads Comcast transferred the phone from one department to another and  another and another and back to where I started. Rachael (sales rep for Comcast) denying there is no such thing. Rachael  said sign up for a program called Rhapsody but at my cost and I could get all the songs I wanted. She said the tech was misinformed. I asked to talk to her supervisor and she refused saying they would call me back. She transferred me to another department and they gave me an address to send a letter if I didn't like it. After a number of requests to talk with someone higher up the chain of command and being refused, Rachael claimed they were not responsible for what the tech told us and laughed. I hung up. They lied to me. The tech, who represents Comcast, told me I would get ten free song downloads for signing up with Comcast but now that we have paid for the service and signed up everyone passed the buck and no one will take responsibility for what the tech told me. They don't have a complaint department, I checked, I asked and they don't care.Ten song downloads that were supposed to be free."
1,I just signed up for comcast internet cable only.  They randomly changed the due date of my second bill so I did not turn in my payment on time.  The payment due date ended up being over a week earlier than the first payment.    I'm faced with a late fee of $5.00 and possibly bad credit.
1,"A few months ago, my internet went out. I called comcast to fix the problem. The tech that came to the house checked everything out and determined it was somewhere away from the house. After repairing the connection, he asked if it was ok to check that my computer was online. I had just connected a computer that was never online before he put his hand on it. After he left, the computer started giving me messages that the registry needed to be fixed even when it was not plugged into the internet. I was really mad and when I called comcast and told them of my problem, they said they don't do computers and can't help me. I since reformated and will never let one of their guys near my computer. I just wonder if they are getting kickbacks for making this happen to unsavy computer users."
1,"Within 2 weeks I had no connection twice. The speeds for this high speed service sometimes are lower than dial-up. When something happens on their end and they have to set up my modem again, it takes them a full day and they act like it's my fault. The reps, either on the phone or in person, are obnoxious. Twice they tried to pull a trick on me by billing me for additional TV services which I have never asked for. And the worst thing about this is that only Comcast provides high speed internet in my area. "
1,"Lowell Cable TV sold to Comcast. This was supposed to be a great deal for the Lowell customers. It has been nothing but a nightmare. They state they are upgrading and need to do a modem swap for our high speed internet. Three appointments were made by THEM and then cancelled by THEM. For one of these appointments, I had someone come to my house. They had no idea the appointment was cancelled, so they waited for nothing. Finally the swap occurred - but that's all it was. WE had to hook up the new modem! Now I get a bill that's so cockeyed, it looks like they are re-billing me for December, which I already paid! I have been trying for 1 1/2 weeks to get to their customer service, to no avail. Each time I end up on hold anywhere from 30-45 minutes. Tonight, I waited over 2 hours and still never got a rep on the line. Tonight I sent 2 e-mails and demanded a call - we'll see what happens. I'm beginning to think that when a call comes in, it just gets put into a holding pool that nobody ever answers. I call at all different times of the day and night, hoping I will get through, but to no avail.I have a life and cannot spend it all on hold with Comcast. Their internet chat is no help - 3 different times I was told they could not access my account and were transferring the chat to somebody else. Nobody ever came back. I am frustrated but have nobody to talk to about it since they don't answer calls. I have a bill that I feel is wrong but is due soon, and I am afraid I will not get this straightened out ever. I cannot spend my day at work on hold with Comcast nor can I spend my time at home on hold with Comcast."
1,"After one month and endless hours of frustration with comcast, our service was finally connected and and working. Due to the long delay in getting our service up, comcast forgave the first months bill for over $170. Within the week however, comcast cut our service for not paying the bill. During this time I have asked to speak with a supervisor no less than 8 times. Always, I am told that one is available but that one would call me back within 24 hours. To date, not one supervisor has called me back to discuss our issues. The day we were disconnected, the line was dropped three times and twice by the same technician. I am finally going to give up and switch to the dish. We were the last holdouts on our street to do so, and now I know why. Hours and Hours of time, phone bills, waiting for technicians that don't show, disconnected service, disconnected access to our business e-mail... etc..."
1,"I started my Comcast service in May 2007, within two weeks of my service I was already calling Comcast regarding poor internet connection and service drops. Initially I was told that my network was most likely incorrectly connected and that I should have a professional set up my network. After having this service completed I was still having issues. I continued to call Comcast a total of 33 times in 2 months to rectify this issue. On 3 separate occasions I was told that a service tech would be at my home between the hours of 8am and 2pm on each time the tech never came, never called and 4 hours of my life was wasted each time. A total of 12 hours that I will never get back....added to the countless minutes I have spent on the phone easily equals a week of my life that is gone and wasted. At this time I am paying for Comcast's 6mbs service however every speed test I have ever had done shows my download times a 386kbs which is not even remotely close to what I am paying. In fact, it is only 6.5% of what I am paying for. Also, I have been told on numerous occasions that I cannot cancel my account, even if I was looking to receive service from another provider... (for cable internet there is no one else in my area). Comcast has wasted my time, money and patience.  "
1,"My high speed Internet is a joke. Often I cannot open my webpage or if I click a prompt to go to another website (e.g., such as an article on the New York Times website) my computer freezes and I have to shut down the Internet and start again. For several days now, I have not been able to open my email. I called Comcast again this week and I got help but then it happened again. I have to try several times to check my email. Now tonight I cannot get into my email again. The Comcast page will not open after about 5 attempts. I got fed up went into google to see if there is a place to make a complaint. Then I saw a list of letters from other consumers who are fed up with Comcast. I pay a high monthly rate to have ths service and it frequently does not work properperly, often setting me behind in the work I had planned to do that particular day. Comcast has a monopoly on Internet service in my area. They run my cable, my phones, and of course Internet access to email. Something needs to be done about this service. I cannot not always complete research or answer email in a timely manner that is related to my work. I feel I am paying way too much money for a lousy service."
1,"I was one of the first Comcast high speed Internet customers several years ago and was charged $95.99/month for 6Mb/sec download.  Recently I spoke to a Comcast Customer Service Rep and was told I was still paying for high speed, but that they had increased the speed to 9 Mb/sec months ago, but never increased my speed.  They never reduced my bill back to $33.99/mo as they should have.    I estimate I was overcharged $62/mo for 2-4 years.  They have now reduced my bill to $33.99/mo, but offered no credit.  This is an estimated overcharge of between $1,500 and $3,000.  How many thousands of customers have the same scenario?  This should result in a class action suit against Comcast in the millions possibly billions of dollars, and I request the Consumer Affairs advocacy group take this matter and follow up on my behalf as Comcast refuses to listen or credit me, although they acknowledge the error.  I need assistance with determining exactly when high speed was increased from 6mb/sec to 9mb/sec to calculate the exact damages. This is an estimated overcharge of between $1,500 and $3,000.  How many thousands of customers have the same scenario?  This should result in a class action suit against Comcast in the millions possibly billions of dollars and I request the Consumer Affairs advocacy group take this matter and follow up on my behalf as Comcast refuses to listen or credit me, although they acknowledge the error."
1,"Comcast failed to acknowledge my payment, turned off my service, and applied my payment to my ex-wife's closed account.  They turned off all 3 (Voice, Cable, Internet).  Initially I thought I missed a payment, but my checking account showed that a check had cleared.  I pinned down customer support on this, and they agreed that they had received a check.  However, they had applied the payment to my ex-wife's account that had been closed for 4 months. They were remarkably unapologetic.Since I was out of town at the time, my daughter was left without phone service for several days.  I was out $128."
1,"I have had intermittent connection issues with Comcast HSI services for the past 5 months and when I call to get it fixed I get bumped arround and handed the I understand your frustration patronization routine. I've contacted the corporate offices in PA only to have them escalate it back to the department in Illinois that has been unable and or unwilling to fix the problem. Due to node saturation my connection is usefull 1/10th of the time I try after 6:30PM and 1:00AM. Pure and simpe, an oversold network. No line or signal problems, no computer problems on my end. An oversold network where I don't get the speed I was advertised MORE than half the day let alone the inability sometimes to even open a web page. Morning rolls arround and everythings is a-ok.Something not symtematic of end user problems. If it's not node saturation, what is i?. And custumer service? Where is it? After close to 25 techs out on my line and countless hours (And cell minutes burning away) later still no resolution in sight.I'm paying for a service that was advertised (the speed was advertised not the signal) and even though I dont get the speed I still get the bill."
1,"I called to see why my internet has been so slow lately for about the past month or two. They stated that if I want their 'new' high speed internet, then I will have to pay an additional $10 per month. From what I gathered from the person on the phone, they have recently slowed down their internet speed and are now charging for what used to be there basic high speed internet. I refuse to pay, but am concerned for all the others who are falling prey to this.They are charging $10 more for what was once part of their high speed internet."
1,"Comcast has blocked my services because they are accusing me of spamming and say they can not help me because I use Microsoft Outlook. I am an ordinary, everyday customer who does not spam, in fact, I hate forwarded emails.  I am paying them close to $150 a month and now I am blocked.What can I do about this infringement on my rights?"
1,How do you put a price on not being able to chat with your mommy?
1,I continue to pay for a service that I am not getting.I now have an official email stating that My computer has been shut down for spam.  
1,When I went to Comcast internet service I was told I needed a modem and that I could rent it or buy a modem. I bought one and faxed a copy of the receipt so I would not be charged. I called to cancel my cable TV with them and was told that I pay a $3.00 charge for renting a modem. I didn't know this because I showed them a receipt and should not be charged this fee. Can I sue them for this?They took money and should not have. I just wonder how many other customers they have cheated.
1,"As of Oct 27, 07 I have not been able to access the home page to get to my e-mail account. I contacted tech support today 10-29-07 to ask what was going on. Response from them was that they had no idea when the home page would be working again. No one in their company will even tell tech support what is happening. I tried to  file a complaint on the address and that did not work! Do you think next time they change a format that's for their home page they might test for these kind of issues? As usual no one is talking to the people that can make these things work."
1, My friends in New Zealand are unable to send me any e-mails over my Comcast internet service. There is no reason for this. I spent a lot of money on Comcast and will be moving to another company after many loyal years.
1,"I responded to an ad from Comcast for phone and internet service as I already had basic cable service through my building which is required and accomodates seniors.  I was told by Mr. Weeks that the total charges I would pay per month including any fees and taxes would be $72.79 for internet and phone service as I pay the basic cable through my builing here at Sun North, Peppertree Manor.  I was very cautious in making sure of the total amount I would need to pay per month to insure I could meet the obligation and was assured this $72.79 would be the total including fees and taxes, nothing more would be added.  The phone service was not installed and I got a bill for both services, internet and phone in the amount of $179.32. I called Comcast and Vanessa corrected the bill and assureed me my total bill I would need to pay the following month would be $72.79.  I get my new bill and it is for $80.40.  I have talked with a variety of people and the last one, David, Accounting Supervisor tells me I have been misinformed and there is nothing he can do so in other words it is my problem and at my expense, however I have not misinformed anyone about anything so I do not understand why I must pay a price for their mistake.  Isn't something wrong here?  I was at the Dr.'s office on Wednesday, because I have a serious health issue and the elders there were speaking about Comcast taking advantage of elderly people and I am here to validate and verify this is happening and I would like to know if there is a remedy for this.Not only am I upset but I am living on a limited income with serious medical issues.  I would appreciate knowing that someone is accountable and responsible for this behavior.Not only am I upset but I am living on a limited income with serious medical issues.

1,"I purcchased a new cable modem, and called to get Comcast to register it at 6:30 on Oct. 25. They advised that it would be done by 9:00 PM. The gentlemen told me to use modem provision number 309631 if I needed to call in again to avoid have to repeat all of my account info, namae etc.When I call at 9:15 Comcast had not completed the work and I was told it would be another 20 minuted. I called bacck in 15 minute and gave the person my provision number 309631 and  along with two other s listed above told me I would have to give them all my info again. I tried to tell them that I was told that all I had to give was the provision number, but they refused to help me. I asked to speak to a superviser and they would not let me talk to one until I gave them all my infor. I hung up and tried again, same senerio, hung up tried again, and after the third try at 10:05 I got someone who help once they the provision number. Service was working around 10:20 PM.I was treated like some piece of S by several people, and feel that Comcast has no regard for the customer at ALL.I was treated like some piece of S by several people, and feel that Comcast has no regard for the customer at ALL."
1,"Comcast does it again. They make a new site format, then push it down the user's throats without a choice. The ending result is that I have been without internet service for four days. And forget about a discount off the bill."
1,"a little over a tear ago, where I had slow internet and noise on the TV.  After I did troubleshooting on my own, comca$t came out.  I went over my troubleshooting and explained that the prblem lay between my home and the comca$t offices.  After SEVEN visits over THREE MONTHS where signal boosters were added (and removed), the cable modem was replaced, all of the converter boxes were replaced, the drop to the house was replaced AND the cable through the entire home was replaced, TWICE,  someone FINALLY had the original idea? to search upstream  between my home and the comcast offices.  (This only AFTER I filed a complaint with the BBB and the States Attorney Generals office!)  Well WHAT DO YOU KNOW?!?!  The problem existed between my home and the comca$t offices! GEE, how would have thunk??Presently, my web site was deleted as c0mcast upgrades their storage.  I am unable to restore my page since front page no longer works with the service.  Files manually placed via FTP are inaccessible via web browser.  For this I pay over $1800 / year?  OH< and they are raising the prices AGAIN in a few days."
1,"Comcast, for the second time in a year, hiked my fees for cable internet by almost 90%. There was NO warning.   I spoke to three different customer representatives.  Rep 1 wanted me to pay two months in advance to continue with my service.  Rep 2 said that the new price is what it was and that I had no choice.  Rep 3 only tried to sell me services I didn't want, need or ask for.  Their reps are rude and ignorant, without even a standard answer. Their unannouced hikes can potentially harm the credit of those who use automatic bill pay."
1,Comcast is advertising unlimited internet and is putting an arbitrary limit on news group downloads and on outgoing email. Also when they bought out time warner they did away with dialup access for when your out of town. Also their internet is down more than it is up. Someone do something!
1,"Basically they charge for a service  which they can't provide. They have too many customers and this slows down the internet service in my area to speeds slower than dial up.This is worst from the time periods of 7PM to 12AM when internet usage is heavy. Six months ago I called for three months explaining what I was experiencing and what the problem was. I must have seen twenty technicians, told them the same story, not for three months did I finally get a call from a local manager asking me to please stop calling technicians, they were going to fix the problem. The problem was rectified when they split the node, the explanation I was given was that there was too many people on the node, something I had been saying for three months.I was credited for the internet time, but not the hours lost on the phone and time spent with technicians, which was well above ridiculous levels.Now, four months later, my service is awful again, for the same reasons, internet is too slow because too many people are on it. I called and am about to get the run around again.I'm fed up and I called and told a supervisor that if I wasn't treated right I will take legal action."
1,"Received a call on answering machine on Oct 4 morning at 6am, stating Comcast felt too much bandwidth was used, and issuing a warning. Another call took place on Friday, same warning. Monday, Oct. 7th, they called again at 7am, still the warning. Then today, I got disconnected without any sort of warning. Talked to their Policy and Abuse department twice and got the internet service back.They said I was among the 1/10 of 1 percent of users/customers of Comcast that were using too much bandwidth last month. When asking for a hard figure for how much is too much, he couldn't come up with any number, nor can give me any figure of what average user use in term of bandwidth per month.Lost the internet connection for about 2-3 hours since Comcast's Policy and Abuse department put my account on hold/disconnect. I had to spend a hour with them (good thing I didn't have Comcast phone service in the house) and had to talk to them to reconnect my internet service. Also the 2 phone calls in the early morning did seem like Comcast doesn't care when they call you, which I think FCC might have some sort of regulations on when they can call(not before 8am?).Lost the internet connection for about 2-3 hours since Comcast's Policy and Abuse department put my account on hold/disconnect.

1,"The service was only restored on the next Monday after being on line and on the phone for more than 1.5 hours.Tech support guys said they could not do anything about it, as it was with the billing guys.I have had an account with Timewarner for 5 years and never had such an issue, but since Tiemwarner sold it to COMCAST the problems have increased significantly."
1,"I have had to use Comcast (the only high speed internet in southeast Michigan) for the past several years. I have constantly had to call and complain about mysterious price jumps and service interruptions. The most recent let down was fixed by offering me free HBO a couple months back. Along with demanding a monthly credit, I accepted the HBO courtesy. My most recent bill reflects HBO charges. Apparently, they gave it to me temporarily to shut me up but decided it was time to start charging me without my being aware. The online bill statement does not specify this charge....it was included in my package. I had to speak to three different representatives in order to get the charges dropped now instead of on your next billing cycle."

1,"Recently Comcast merged with Road Runner in our area.  I have had Road Runner for several years and didn't mind paying for decent service, but since the merger and rate increase I am looking for a different carrier.  Daily, the box has to be unpluged and wait for 15 to 30 minutes then started over again.  They admit to knowing that they have this problem but had no second thoughts about that rate increase.Lets see - worse service, higher prices.  What a way to keep customers!"

1,"Approximately, September 1, 2006, I cancelled my telephone and internet service with Comcast due to consistent technical difficulties. Also, I downgraded my cable service with them to basic cable. However, I have been trying to get them to credit back my account for services they are charging me for that I do not have. They have collected their equipment ever since October 2006. They are currently charging me for internet service that I do not have with them. They have charged me for standard cable and refuse to credit me back to September and also insist on charging me to have their technicians come out to change the filters to downgrade the cable service. It is not fair that a consumer should have to pay for an error made on Comcast's behalf. They are forcing me to pay for their lack of communication and failure to update their records."
1,"My high speed internet works only intermittently. I've registered a complain more than 2 months back. I've had 6 different technician come and all of them referred it to a networking comcast tech. Till date none of them showed up or fixed the issue. I also had 4 different appointments, but th etech's never showed up either making me wait and wonder. I still don't know when it will be fixed.I'm being mentally tortured and I've spend lots of money, time and energy calling th ecustomer reps and also visiting local comcast office. I feel they are discriminating me."
1,"Recently, my wife discovered that Comcast had been overcharging us for high-speed Internet for the past year. After 5 calls and more than an hour spent on the phone, including one call with a very rude representative to my wife, we resolved the issue: Comcast has credited our account for nearly $400.   Two days later, our service was disconnected. I spent a half-hour trying to resolve this issue. Later in the evening, a Comcast rep called me to sell me digital phone service to add to our package. The lack of customer service and lack of apology is incredibly disturbing as someone who works in public relations. I am seriously considering switching services."
1,"I have only had Comcast for ~ 3 months and am currently experiencing my second major problem. First my internet service was out for 11 days and Comcast kept sending out a technician that was not qualified to repair the job even though they were repeatedly told by myself and their own service technician that they needed a higher up tech to come out. I still have not received my credit for the 11 days my service was out and probably never will though I call every two weeks. Now my cable has been completely out or scrambled to the point of not being able to watch the TV without becoming nauseated for 5 days. I called to report outage on first day, was given an appointment for 4 days after initial call (although my neighbor who I share walls with and who also had outage problem was given an appointment the following day) and received a call 3 hours into my four hour appointment window that my appointment needed to be rescheduled for another 10 days out. I asked to speak to a supervisor which I have done in the past and their standard answer seems to be There isn't one here at the moment.  What a joke. If there is a company out there that cares less about Customer service I would have to see it to believe it."
1,"The turned off our cable, saying that the account is in abuse status. They wouldn't give a reason or send out a technician. They give us a number to a voice mailbox which is full and we can't do anything to get our service on. The cable is on the floor in accross the front door and people are tripping on it."
1,"Comcast was contacted about installong a cable modem for acess to the internet. Installer spent more time on his cell phone yelling at his girlfriend then he did with the install. Surprisingly(?), the modem refused to work, so he uninstalled all my Anti-virus and Firewall programs. Unfortunately, I had to work so my mother, who knows nothing about computers, was left to deal with this fool. I came home to a mess, the hard-drive was totally corrupted and full of viruses and spy-ware."
1,"I subscribed to Comcast's internet service. For the longest time I received nothing but spam. So I set up spam filters against **, Mortgages, etc. Then all of a sudden I was no longer receiving emails from family and friends. I allowed my daughter to use one of my mailboxes so that she could receive job alerts or email responses for applications for employment. Again, all spams but no job alerts. I contacted the so-called tech support and I got the run around several times. The excuse I got from Comcast is that there are filters that is preventing the emails. My question is this, why would a ** filter prevent emails from Monster.com? I asked this question and I was told that even though that there is a filter for Viagra, this filter can delete all emails. So I deleted the filters from my account and my daughter's account. Still no emails, but an occasional spam. Hmmm. I wonder what crook is lining the pockets of Comcast? I sent an email to the local Executive Assistant telling her that if this problem is not solved within 48 hours, I will cancel my account and sue Comcast. I also told the Executive Assistant that I will contact Qwest and order their DSL service. Fifteen minutes later my daughter receives almost 400 emails. Now all of a sudden she is receiving her job alerts. Over half of the emails were potential job prospects that she lost out on because of the idiots at Comcast. Now here we are back to square one. No more emails but a trickle of spam about two to three times a day. I have called the Corporate Office at least 40 times and still no solution to the problem. I have contacted the Office of Telecommunications and still nothing."
1,"Comcast advertises 35% faster speeds than DSL. This is not true. We have had Comcast service less than a week and it is horrible. It doesn't work at times with serious delay, slower than dial up.   Their customer service is not tech support. They have no answers outside of reboot and/or we will send a technician out.   Comcast Technician came out the next day to check and found nothing wrong.  Their Internet service is horrible and they should quit telling lies about being faster."
1,"Comcast ISP continues to deliver mail to my account which is addressed to other people, not addressed to me. Every day 4-6 appear addressed to someone else. Please stop it, I do not want to read other peoples mail."
1,Comcast continues to deliver E mails addressed to other people at my account. This is not a case of adress names being close or the same up to the 5th letter. Mail continues to pour in addressed to other people after every attempt possible to get it to stop. Comcast simply does not provide a way to be contacted.
1,"On JAN/08/2006 i decided to change my Bellsouth DSL service for a Comcast ""high speed internet"" (yeah, right). So I puchased a Modem, and call costumer service to initiate my service... so far so good. Well they couldn't see my modem so they have to send someone over to see what is the probem. 1st guy found out that the signal is not strong enough, but did not have the key to get in downstairs. 2nd guy was told that no one would be home before 3:00pm, so he came by at 2:15pm... very smart. 3rd guy I don't even think he spoke any English...but he didn't have any keys either. 4th guy had the key, found out that the cable was bad...but it wasn't his job to run a new cable. 5th guy was running 30 minutes late, that in real life turned out to be 6 hours. than he had no idea what was going on... but no problem someone else will be coming to my house in 30 minutes. (I can't believe that I fell for that one too).   Well 29 days have gone by and i never received any service. I thank god for bellsouth."
1,"I pay over $50 per month for broadband calbe (internet). I have the spam filters provided by comcast. I have complained many times about the unbelievable amount I receive on a daily basis. They say ""we'll look in to it"". This is comcast based spam. Reporting it does NO good at all."
1,"I have previously asked COMCAST to stop SPAM messages.  My filters are on as they instructed.   I have asked you to filter them on their end.  I have reported them over and over and again and again.  They keep coming with little hope it will stop.  I had to finally crack down.   I decided to bill COMCAST $2.00 for each SPAM infraction.  My email is not free.  I pay COMCAST a bill every month.  I expect better service.  The total of credit demanded of COMCAST is now $808.00 for over 400 unwanted and unfiltered messages since November 9th when I decided to start billing COMCAST.  COMCAST’s failure to filter unwanted SPAM will not be tolerated any longer!!!!!!!  As a condition for cashing my checks to COMCAST, I expected credit to be granted.  The response to the SPAM problem has been abysimal and SPAM will not be tolerated.  I even setup some new email accounts.  They are also getting SPAM.    The service is unacceptable.  Their response to the SPAM problem has been abysimal.  COMCAST will no longer respond so I am now having to have to take it to another level."
1,Comcast increased their monthly price for internet access from $42 to $57.  that's a 36% increase in price!  And there is definitely no enhancement in the speed of internet access nor the quality of service.
1,"I had Adelphia high-speed Internet in Southern CA for 5 years and never had a problem. I just moved to PA and Comcast is the only company with high-speed. Comcast is a terrible company to deal with for service problems! First, it took one month to get the service connected because of a Comcast records problem. Now, I have intermittent service (on 10 minutes and off for 5) and Comcast cannot find the problem. The tech told me today that there are 6 or 7 others in this neighborhood experiencing the same problem! The tech has been out 5 times now, and this Friday will be the sixth. The worst thing is that there is no way to escalate the problem within Comcast! Verizon cannot provide DSL where I live or I would switch in a minute. I am seriously considering going back to dial-up, except I have VoIP at a reasonable cost with AT&T and would hate to give that up. If you have good service with Comcast you are lucky. I have heard nothing but comments on how bad their service is here in PA. Competition is badly needed in this business. I really don't think that Comcast would survive with competition."
1,"I scheduled a day off work to be home for the installation. Although my scheduled time was 3pm - 5pm, I was told that if the technican finished early on another job he may call to complete my job order prior to the scheduled time. While the technician was still at my home, I called Cox Communication to complain of the problem. They were also amazed at the fact the ceiling had a limitation for installation from the PRM Company. How many other future potential clients of Cox Communication are disatisfied with this type of service?"
1,"Honestly I'm switching to dish and DSL with a $40. Thats a nice saving is you ask me. One last thng I forgot to mention, despite 2 tech visit my lower channels are still fuzzy (despit new wiring and numerous checks to the line)."
1,"Damage Resulting: A terrible-looking orange wire running across my property, that I am concerened my children or other neighbor children are playing with."
1,"For well over 3 years, my family and I enjoyed the benefits of having a home network system between just 2 computers, sitting side by side. File sharing across the network is one way we used our network. In our family, also, we enjoyed playing games with each other across the network. This, after all, seemed to be a safe way to allow our kids to enjoy the world of multiplayer gaming, but without the concerns of them interacting with strangers out on the web in gaming chat rooms.About 1 years ago, my wife enrolled in an online college program. She tried to manage with our mere telephone modem Internet access, but for all the obvious reasons (continuous disconnects, high internet traffic, etc.), it became necessary to get high-speed (HS) Internet access - something more reliable for her educational needs. With Comcast having recently dug up our street and installed the lines, and because they are the only TV cable company in our area, they seamed to be our only realistic option for HS Internet access.The Comcast installation technician was a gentleman, and was quite good, respectful, and new exactly what needed to be done. He installed one modem, then from that modem was attached our network hub. This gave both computers immediate Internet access. This was cool! After he left, and once our kids came home from school, we found, however, that we no longer could play games across the network. None of our file sharing or printer sharing capabilities existed anymore. We could go online and play multiplayer games just fine, individually, but not simultaneously. Though being a little PC hardware and software savvy ourselves, we still could not find a way to regain our home network capabilities.In frustration, and after a week of doing research, I learned something very disturbing - Comcast software, used for their HS Internet modems, automatically disables/sabotages home networks where they are installed; for another monthly fee, Comcast will come back (another day of work lost for me) and install their router that will enable my home network to work again, which, if you recall, worked just fine before they messed it up. Now remember, their technician installed one modem, connected our hub to it, and gave Internet access to both home PCs. No one said that our home network gaming and file sharing days were going to be over, UNLESS we paid them a monthly fee to fix something THEY disabled.OK, we may not be techno junkies, but were not entirely ignorant either. We went out to our local Radio Shack and bought a router. Problem solved. We got our network back, without loosing our Internet, and without being blackmailed into paying Comcast to fix something they  messed up. I really feel that Comcast was not forthcoming in explaining to this customer just how their HS Internet access was going to affect our existing home network. And, Comcast would not make right the problem that their hardware/software caused. Comcasts only solution was for them to come out, again, and install a router. And then, if that wasnt enough, they wanted to charge us $4.99/month/computer in our home that was on that network."
1,"Comcast has been a constant problem since it took over our cable, telephone and internet services over 1 year ago from AT&T.; There has been intermittent service eruptions, poor picture quality and billing for services that we do not use and have not ordered. One issue I have is that Comcast is trying to force us to order its family networking service because we have a laptop in addition to our work station. I am so tired of this."
1,"The advice from technicians has been everything from removing ribbon cables, disabling ALL firewalls, virus scans, etc. (by the way I have a brand new computer with plenty of memory) to the suggestion that my new computer doesn't have enough memory!!!! Dell 8200 series. I have received a host of generic emails, waited for hours on the telephone only to constantly receive a patronizing ""ping"" report and NO real help. I simply do not get what I pay for."
1,"I use the internet for various financial transactions . So far I have managed to work around this poor service and have not lost money, only time. When the comes that it finally does cause me a financial lose, I will take them to court."

1,I then received flyers from them for free connection in servicable areas. Sorry but that doesen't apply to you is the answer I got to those. I even offered to have the cable ran by a subcontracter they were still going to charge me $2800.00 just to turn on the service if I did that.I even called the corporate office who said I am a servicable area and I had the flyer for free conection but that still does not apply to me. I have been fighting with this company for almost a year now. The flyers that I received came in my name to my address. 
1,"I am an internet subscriber of Comcast. Recently their IP Network Abuse department has begun sending out AUP Violation letters, specifically targeting excessive bandwidth usage. Unfortunately, neither the letter, the AUP, the Comcast websites, nor any printed Comcast materials specify what those bandwidth usage limitations are. Essentially, what they are doing is drawing an invisible line, then threatening to disconnect anyone who crosses it. There is no way for a user to know what threshold was broken or how much they need to back off their usage to be within the limitations.I willingly describe myself as a high-end user. I download a lot of SHN and FLAC files, many of which can easily surpass 1GB. However, I am more than willing to curb my usage to meet any limitations set by Comcast ... if only they would actually make those limitations available to their subscribers. The letter provides a customer service number with the suggestion to upgrade to a business class account. First, the reps at the customer service center know absolutely nothing about the bandwidth usage limitations (they will offer to give you the number to the IP Network Abuse department ... more on that soon). Second, they will try to sell you the business class account without telling you that the bandwidth usage limitations don't vary from class to class. You would end up doubling your monthly bill with no added bandwidth. Now, as far as that number for the Abuse department that the customer service reps give out  ... it gives you only the opportunity to leave a message and have a rep call you back. That has yet to happen for me. Luckily, I came across a direct line that connects to an operator. The operator, while unable to answer any computer-related questions, is able to transfer you to a live person in the Abuse department. Not that it helps any. Comcast threatens disconnection if usage doesn't fall within their limitations, which are unknown to users. If I am disconnected, I lose a large part of my livelihood. I rely on the internet for communication, research, financial transactions, data storage and retrieval, and entertainment. Not only am I affected, but also my wife and son (who often uses the internet as an educational resource for school projects)."
1,"This is also a free speech issue, though I shouldn't have to claim a right to free speech to speak to my family. Harrassment - They made unsolicited sales calls to my home. Financial - They are overcharging me, sending collectors after me, and refusing to compensate for undelivered service and false charges."
1,"I have been without internet service since Friday the 21st, not to mention huge packet loss, connectivity issues and numerous disconnects for hours throughout the past 3 months. If this was a free service I really wouldn't care, but since I am paying a monthly fee for service I expect a little more then 1) reboot your modem, it is on your end or 2) We are down, you should be working in a few hours. This is totally unacceptable. I would like to know what occurred and what is being done to rectify the problem. I know I am not the only one affected by Comcast's nonsense and I feel there are major issues which need to be investigated."
1,"The cable internet service we have through Comcast is absolutely unreliable. We live in an upper-end neighbourhood that has 1000+/- homes, and the cable service is on/off on a weekly basis. I can't wait until cable internet service has multiple providers (like the phone companies), and we have freedom of choice.My wife works from home. Due to cable reliability issues, she now finds it necessary to travel into the office to perform her job. All this for $50/mth + tax. What a Deal!"
1,"We want to make others aware that Comcast is using poor communication and misleading information to their customers, and prima facia intend to charge cusomters more than agreed."
1,I am so dissatisfied with the service and how they manage my phone call complaints and how they don't value a customer that have been with AT&T; for so many years. 
1,"That worked for 2 days, then the internet connection went out again. I called them back and they sent a tech out the next day. He took some measurements of signal strength and decided that the signal is too weak. Recommended another service date to install a signal booster. They scheduled an appointment 2 days later between 1-4 pm. I called back 2 times during that period to check on their progress. Each time I was reassured that they were coming as scheduled. Then at 4:45 I got a call from the tech saying that they are running on time and should be there between 5-8pm. They couldn't explain why I was told otherwise. To make it worse, they said they'd fix the cable signal strength (nothing is wrong with the cable signal strength), but would not boost the internet signal."
1,"Comcast has been overbilling me for a year on cable modem service since Aug, 2001. Made so many phone calls but they never correct it. The last phone call in Aug 2002 is the first time in a year they asked for proof that I returned the equipments. I spent lots of time and finally found the receipt and faxed back. (Dated 8/25/2001 as the date of returning the equipment) It is Nov 1st and still NO ANSWER!! Why a company this big keep robbing me for a little $50 monthly cable modem service fee for a year."
1,"I ordered cable Internet service from Comcast on May 2nd. I knew I would be one of the first people in my market to get the service because it had not been available previously. I was sent a self installation kit as I requested, but then received a call saying that Self installation was not supported in Detroit, and I'd need an appointment to have an installer come out. So I promptly cancelled my service that day. Then I finally got a call from someone who actually works for Comcast in Detroit. He told me I never should have been sold a modem in the beginning of May, and that they are still going through detroit upgrading the equipment in some neighborhoods. Why doesn't anyone selling the modems know this? Why have they wasted ao much of my time? There's not one person at Comcast that has any clue what anyone else is doing. The national call center, which is where all calls for technical assistance are directed, is completely useless. They don't knoe what's going on in most local areas. Unfortunately for me, like many others, Comcast is the only choice for cable internet in my area."
1,"I ordered cable internet service from Comcast Cable in December. We received our self installation kit, but were never able to get it set up properly. After several attempts at installing it, we basically gave up, no longer interested in the service. Admittedly, we were lax about having the service officially shut off. But since we never actually received service, we didn't think that we would be charged for the service. Renee should complain in writing to the Philadelphia city agency that licenses Comcast.  "
1,"Then I arranged to pick up the software and install it myself. After installing it, I found out that they didn't install a ethernet card or provide one which is supposed to come at no charge to the consumer. I offered to pick one up and install it myself, but they declined. Now they want me to schedule a 6th appointment. I am so tired of them pushing me around. Since I am forced to do cable through Comcast, there isn't a whole lot to do and they seem to be taking advantage of that. Can you help me on this?    "
1,"After buying a new house, we called to transfer service. Comcast came out and set up our TV, phone, and Internet connection. A week later, we received a letter stating, ""As discussed, we will require a deposit from you prior to providing you with service."" The letter continued, ""In evaluating your request, Equifax provided us with information that influenced our decision to require a deposit"". We were shocked by this, since we have had Comcast for 12 years, and have never been asked to give a deposit! Moreover, we just bought a house. My wife and I both have credit scores above 770. I called to complain about this and actually got the ""information from Equifax"", but Janekia 9NV told me that it was a mistake. The technician should have checked another box! When I asked for more information, none was provided. This was outrageous on principal. I quickly cancelled all the services from Comcast and will never use them again. It seems they have to find more money because they bought NBC!"
1,"I hate Comcast!  I have had service problems with my cable TV ever since I got a new DTS box.  I have spent weeks on the phone with customer service representatives trying to troubleshoot the problem.  They would send a signal across and the TV would finally work again but go out the very next day.  This happened over six times.  I have had four service calls scheduled and nobody ever showed up.  I took an off at work four times and I have lost vacation time and wages that have cost me over $1,000 so far. Did I say I hate Comcast!  I am sick because of all the stress that they have caused me!  I hate Comcast!  You are full of bunch of lies, cheats, thieves, lies and more lies.  I hate Comcast!  And I really hate lies!  One day Comcast will be out of business because they just don't care!Victor **"
1,"I called Comcast because we were getting intermittent internet service. They sent a technician that indicated my modem was bad, and was replaced. The problem continued. I was still getting service only if I disconnected the cable from the back of the modem and replaced it. I called again, and a different technician came and diagnosed the problem being from outside and not the modem. The first technician has taken my modem as I did not  need it anymore. They sent a Comcast truck with a technician from Comcast. He indicated that there were several problems, and he replaced several items in the box outside. I called Comcast to get a credit for not having to use the service. They indicated they can only give credit for one month because there was intermittent service and there will be no credit for the modem. They are still charging me for the modem even though they have my personal modem.Basically, we did not use the service for over 4 months as what was indicated by the service person. Mr. Ron indicated they can see how much usage of the internet we had, but he will not provide me with that information. He further indicated that he will call other technicians and find out what has happened. He also indicated that they do not give credit for intermittent service even though it was the first technician that failed to diagnose the problem correctly, and gave me a modem that I did not need and charged me $7 per month for the modem.   "
1,"I have limited cable from Comcast.  It is basically channels 2-13 with no extras. I received a flyer in the mail to upgrade my service.  The flyer advertised their digital starter cable package and internet for 39.99 a month for 12 months,  with a 2 year commitment.  I called the number on the flyer and a rep informed me that he didn't know how to upgrade my account and to call a different 1800 number.  So I called that number,  and the rep told me that the package did not exist and I needed to take my flyer into a comcast service center in person.  So I went to the nearest service center with my flyer in hand.  The rep at the store told me that they have never heard of the package and that they would look into it and to call back in several days.  I left the store extremely dissatisfied because they offered no resolution.  I couldn't believe that Comcast didn't at least say, ""We can't offer you this package,  but here is a different one...""  which I probably wouldn't have taken,  but it would have been good customer service to try to resolve the problem.  Instead I was simply sent away.  I called them back later that evening to make a complaint to a manager and was told that they could sign me up no problem.  We will see when I get my first bill if I am in fact under the plan that I wanted because according to most of their reps that plan didn't exist.  This isn't the first time I have heard of Comcast commited advertising fraud.  In 2010 my girlfriend signed up for their service and was given the bait and switch on her plan.  It took 60 days and a complaint to better business to get it sorted out in their computer.  "
1,"I start my service with Comcast 7 months ago. When I spoke with the sales rep in the concord brunch, he offered me a complete package plus the Latino channels and internet for about 115 dollars a month for the first 6 months, after that it would be 135 dollars per month. When the 6th month happened i receive a bill for 135 dollars; however the seven month my came for the amount of 165 dollars. When i call them to complain about it, they said that it was a mistake from the salesman but the only way to get my plan cheaper would be downgrading it."
1,"They 'upgraded' the guide 7/11/11 and without notification or price change eliminated: timers; ability to save dvr shows onto vhs tape (a huge thing!); can't view 5 programs on guide, 1 line hidden by new ad space which keeps bleeping in and out; no more audio/video settings to customize view; have to change view settings to one-view to read all guide info. "
1,"I called comcast 06/15/2011 and talked Ashley @  extension 1252516 to find out why my bill was so high, because I'd already had my cable services wit comcast for almost 8 years so I switched my internet and home phone services from AT&T to comcast and was quote a price of 179.00 per month for all services my first bill was 658.83, Ashley told me that a 200.00 deposit had been added to the bill I asked her why she stated that it shouldn't be and that she'll take care of it and if I have any problems with it to call her back @ 1252516, so I called back because it hasn't been taken off, i talked to Whel , he tranferred me to Amy @ extension 1242223, she stated to me that I had to pay it after keeping me on hold for 33 minutes, I told her why wasn't I told this from the beginning if I would have stayed with AT&T, she states that she'll call me back."
1,2nd Bill 6/6/11 $442.99  3rd Bill 7/6/11 I still owe $170.06 for one month of Phone and Internet.  No were on the bill does it show a credit of $174.99 for the tv service that was canceled or the $18.50 for the equipment rental. I also returned all equipment and am still being billed for remotes that I already returned. I have called every month from day of installation.  Should have know it would be a problem when the service tech gave me my email and work order.  My last name was misspelled.
1,"I received a letter saying the extra two boxes I received with my digital preferred package would no longer get all the stations I paid for.  These boxes were provided as part of the package when I purchased it.  I called and they told me that for a promotional price of $9.99 per month for 12 months, I could continue to get the channels on the additional two boxes.  I feel this is a way Comcast goes around the system to implement a price increase without getting approval like they normally have to.  Can something be done?"
1,"Comcast has confirmed that the wiring to my house, a main line, is in need of repair and requires permits. In the mean time, I have four cable boxes; and on a daily basis, we have patchy screens or blue screens. The internet is out frequently too. They refuse to credit me anything on my bill until this is resolved. This is going on for years; and I am not the only one in our townhouse cluster."
1,"I have ""basic cable."" I used to get the Red Sox baseball games and the local news on basic cable. Xfinity changed that so all I get with ""basic cable"" is a bunch of Spanish channels, two Boston channels and a bunch of PBS stations. I can no longer get Red Sox baseball or the New England Patriots football. Both of these sports programs are available off-the-air in the Boston area and according to my interpretation of the FCC rules, therefore are supposed to be duplicated on the cable.Therefore, Comcast violates FCC rules. Any attempt to fix this, either through the FCC or through Comcast fails. Comcast claims that any lawsuit will fail because their lawyers are paid for by their stockholders while my lawyers are paid out of my pocket so I should, ""see the consequences of any such action."" This was their response when I threatened to sue them."
1,in may 2011 i view an ad for comcast cable 19.99 per month. i called they said 19.99 first year 29.99 second year two year contract i reluctanly agreed then they say installation fee modem fee but you do not need to pay at once. when they come to install they cut 50 feet of cable screw it to an existing cable and to their modem. they tell me at that time to buy another computer becouse their modem wont work. i exchange computers and install the cord buying outlet bix for wall. they have been harassing me for full payment. I returnded the modem purchased my own. still being billed for it. letters threatening suspension/termination of service and fees if not paid in full. the day i recieved the letter i called them spent over 1 hour on the phone and was given an address in philidelpia to write to with no help. i am in the process of trying to send a written complaint 
1,"Years ago I bought a TiVo HD unit.  I was told by Comcast that I could buy the cards for a one-time charge. For one year or so, I had no charge after the initial charge.  I bought four more units and when I received the new cards, they changed the deal.  But due to the confusion, they charged me a reduced fee for six cards and nothing for the rest.  This went on for many years until about five months ago when a service call was made and they had to reset my cards.  Since then my bill went up over 100 dollars.  They openly admit that they do not know how to put my account back to where it should be. I have spoken with so many people but nobody has gotten back to me except one supervisor who won't return my calls. I am stuck with Comcast due to the 5000 dollars I have invested in my TiVos. I need help. My email is **. My cell is ** and my home is **.  Thank you. Mark."
1,"I was told by Comcast when the Digital conversion was made that their customers did not need to worry because ""..,they had us covered."". Now I am being told that I need to buy converters to wartch their service. This is not only on the analog Tv's I have, but also the new TV I bought my son in Febuary is not getting the channels he did before, this is a brand new RCA HD TV. Can they legally make me buy these devices when they told us before ""that we didn't need to do anything."" ?"
1,"I am a loyal Comcast customer abused by rude representative (operator BZB) while paying bill at Marshfield, MA office.On July 1, 2011, I had an upsetting experience here while paying my bill.  There was an error on my balance (recently downsized services and had credit, which wasn't reflected on balance due).  The male service representative (operator BZB) approached me at the counter.  Barely a moment after I inquired about the error, he rudely replied, ""I'm not going to spend an hour with you!"" He went on to say, ""last time I spent 55 minutes with you and later you complained about me.""I stood there stunned as he insulted me with a coworker and customers present.  Refusing me service, he made me get in the other representative's line.  Evidently, he held a grudge against me (the consumer) for wasting his time the prior month!  Yes, I spent time reviewing options, figuring out which services to change, etc. I turned in cable boxes for free adapters to save dollars.  Once home, the CC technical department couldn't activate them (operator BZB failed to enter needed codes), causing us a loss of cable for two days! Who should be mad over wasted time and mistreatment?"
1,"We were transferring our service to our new home.  A three-hour window was given for Friday, 7/1/11, between 11-2.  No call, no show.  So we called them and were told they were so sorry and they would send our concern to dispatch.  Dispatch called at 3 and they said they were so sorry, their serviceman was just leaving a job that had held him up and he would be here soon.  They called at 5 pm and said they were so sorry but their serviceman was still at the other job but would be here between 5 and 6.  No call, no show.  Called back and they said they were so sorry, they will check and that they didn't know what happened and they'd send this over to dispatch.  Dispatch called and you guessed it, they said ""so sorry"" but he will be there by 7 pm.  No call, no show.  We called again, and they said, ""So sorry but he has not been put in a cancel notice so he 'must' be coming. No, we didn't know when, I understand you were upset and I would be, too.  Yes, I can have a supervisor call you back.""The time, oh it will be one to two hours!  For the third time, they will credit my bill whole $20.  Wow.  Serviceman finally got here at 7:30 pm, saying, ""So sorry.  Yes, I had your number but no, dispatch was supposed to call.""  Did I hear from a supervisor?  You guessed it, ""NO"".    "
1,"I upgraded my Comcast Internet package to Extreme 50 on 5/22/11.  Since then, I have had one week of the advertised speed.  I have been on the phone every day with a representative whose answer is to send out another technician. I have had a total of five techs and the tech supervisor came out to my home. I have told them over and over that the problem is the outside line but they insisted on coming in to check my equipment inside.  Everything is new.  To this day, Comcast has done nothing to rectify the issue. "
1,"Outside contractor for Comcast was redoing lines in Sonora, CA on Golden Street on June 24th. My neighbor saw them catch their basket on my phone line and they ripped it right out off of my house. They left no note or anything. What a surprise to come home on Friday from work and find my phone not working and then having to waste my Saturday waiting for AT&T to re-string my wire. No consideration for anyone. They were lucky I did not have to work the next day or they would be paying me for my time lost."
1,"I am being charged for a service call that I believe should be a Comcast expense. Upon adding a TV and additional DVR receiver to an upstairs bedroom, I was not able to receive reception on most channels both cable and other. A service technician was sent to my home and diagnosed the problem as insufficient cable power coming in to my home. He worked on the cable line outside my home and I was told that he added a temporary power cable to the outside box. He did not make any adjustments in the house. When I discovered the charge to my account for this service call, I contacted Comcast and was told that I have to pay for it. The customer service person then told me that the service technician had also told them that I should not be charged for this call but they were billing me anyhow. This complaint does not even address the three trips I had to make to a service center to get the correct equipment for the TV to start with. This is extremely poor customer relations to a long-standing customer. "
1,"We recently moved out of Maryland to a new state. When we turned in our cable boxes/converters/remotes, we discovered that one digital convert had inadvertently been packed by the movers with our household goods. To make matters worse, the converter was on a small television in our finished basement, and since we are renting for six months while we sell our house in MD and buy a new home, that piece of equipment is located in one of about 200 boxes in long-term storage. We explained the situation to the Comcast rep who told us that we had 60 days to return it or we would be billed $50. Sign, another unforeseen moving expenditure. We asked the rep whether we should pay right then or wait for the bill and she said Comcast would send a bill.Less than 30 days later, Comcast did indeed send us a bill for $50 to cover the (still) missing digital converter. The bill was dated June 7th and had a due date of June 28th. It was forwarded from our home address but we received it on June 13th. My wife wrote a check and sent the payment into Comcast. Yesterday (June 29th) we received a letter from a collection agency for the $50 payment even though our bank shows that Comcast cashed our check on June 23rd. My wife called Comcast this morning and asked to speak with a manager. Comcast received the $50 payment on 6/23/2011. The bill from Comcast wasn't due until 6/28/2011. The letter from the collection agency was dated 6/23/2011. After being on the phone with Comcast for over 1/2 hour asking for a manager, she was transferred to Tracy (team lead), who claimed she was the person in charge. After explaining about the collection letter, Tracy said to my wife that Comcast ""sends the bill to the customer and notifies the collection agency the same day"".  Even though the Comcast bill to the customer has a due date of three weeks later. Excuse me? Comcast notifies a collection agency ""the same day"" that the bill is sent to the consumer? This constitutes consumer credit fraud by (falsely) claiming non-payment on a bill the consumer has not even received yet. "
1,"Our Home Owners Association was informed by Comcast that we must convert all of our TVs with ""digital adapters"" effective late June. Comcast provided ""conversion kits"" with ""DTA boxes"" and channel changers for each of three TVs. As an engineer and past owner/manager of a handyman business, I am reasonably technical but the Comcast TV Conversion Kits are nothing more than Comcast's best attempt to control, convert and force customers to upgrade their systems/services so that Comcast can make more money. The installation process is anything but simple and requires numerous ""program codes"" for each TV and TV channel changer. The old analog system was much simpler and more reliable. I guess we didn't learn our lesson from the auto industry, keep it simple, reliable and cost effective or customers will go elsewhere!"
1,"Comcast has just gone all digital in my area and thus, forcing you to rent descrambling boxes for any channel above 15. Regardless of how much the rental for this is, this is by far the largest cash cow invented by Comcast. Once Comcast's initial cost of the devices is recovered, everything will be almost pure profit outside of replacing the old defective unit.  If that ain't a cash cow, I don't know what it is. I'm glad I switched to Satellite years ago. "
1,"I tried to get back my refund and finally, I did receive my refund exactly 68 days after cancelling my account, which is over 9 weeks. It was canceled on 4/18 as shown on my bill and I received the check on 6/24/11. I finally can consider the problem to be resolved."
1,"On multiple occasions, I have called Comcast, CSRs, and talked to technicians to request them to disconnect my television service because I no longer want their services.  I have been told multiple times by their CSRs via telephone that they apologize and will credit my account and have the service disconnected.  I have yet to see this.On March 26, 2011, after contacting Comcast (3 times) to repair my line, a technician finally came to my home on March 27, 2011.  After the tech completed his work, I asked him to notate on his paper work that I'd like my television disconnected.  He said ""no problem.""  On March 28, 2011, a Comcast truck came to my home and was doing something to the line to my home.  Since this date and prior conversations with Comcast, they are still billing me for TV services. I have also contacted Comcast for a mailing address so I can formally write them a letter regarding this issue and they refuse to supply me with an address.  I refuse to keep calling Comcast for this same issue.  I have a full time job and I cannot stop daily or multiple times a day to call Comcast about this issue just to hear how sorry they are and what they aren't going to do to resolve the issue."
1,"Account was cancelled. 4/13/11, modem was removed and additional line basic. 4/18/11, in person I cancelled my account and returned all equipment at office on Trenton Rd and I asked if I needed to do anything else and they replied no. I also have a receipt of returned equipment on this date. My bills have been paid on time, therefore leaving me with a credit of $66.35. I was told I would receive a check in 4 to 6 weeks. Instead on 5/21/11, all I received was their statement showing my credit balance with the same information as stated above. I called around 5/25 and told them I did not yet receive my refund, they said probably by the second week in June. Today is 6/20/11 and when I spoke to the representative, she said I have a zero balance, I stated no! I have a credit balance, she then explained she had to go to the ledger and this did show my credit balance and also stated refund is done 6 to 8 weeks after the repair disconnected me from pole. This repair man did not come to my home until over 1 1/2 weeks after I already had Verizon install service. They did disconnect because I had underground wiring to do. I still can not get an answer to when I will receive my refund. I am wondering what they would do if people did not pay them? Can anyone help me get this refund because as of my last conversation with Clara from Comcast on 6/20 at 7:16, all she could tell me is 6 to 8 weeks, but from what date this would take place she did not know. She did inform me that if I did not receive my refund by 6/30 to call back again and they will put in a request for payment. How many times do I have to call and what else can I do to get my overpayment back. No physical damage just plain old aggravation on getting money that is due me by Comcast."
1,"Comcast prices are way too high. Their programing is filled with repeats. I don't think I should be paying so much money for this kind of service. I would like to see more cable companies, so I could have more to choose from. I also would like to be able to choose the program's I want."
1,"On 6-4-2011 two Comcast service technicians came into my home without an adult present. My son, who turned 13, in Jan. 2011 and my daughter who is 10 were there alone. They said it will only take 5 minutes to complete work and they were there for 20 minutes according to my son. Technicians also went into rooms without TVs and left jewelry box open and scared my daughter who was in her room by herself. They had no reason to go into her room. Upon leaving they told my son to sign work completed form and left time out line blank. It clearly states that an adult must be present. My son was given no time at all to read paper and was just told to sign. This is a violation of my privacy rights and I fully intend to pursue this matter legally and want to go thru proper channels before I contact a civil attorney on Friday. I have related paperwork and have left a verbal complaint with a Comcast employee over the phone who's name is Ray and have no had any sort of call back or explanation to this matter."
1,"Once I started my Comcast account, I was promised a 100 dollar rebate back if I would deposit a 100 dollars. I spoke to a Justin ** on 6/6/11. He told me I would get my 100 dollars back by the week's end. When I called the company today, I was told there was no rebate check for me and they treated me very rude. When I said I would reach out to someone else to get my rebate, they simply said go ahead. I hope that you all can help me get my 100 dollar rebate from them. I was unable to have my co-payment and therefore is unable to get my hospital appointment and treatment. My co-payment is $75.00. I was depending on my rebate check to cover my co-payment. Now, I don't have it."
1,"I had cable internet reinstalled. I had my own new modem, a Motorola. Serial numbers: 06H7GVXDF355, 128103425705795102010000. HFC MAC ID: 0011AEC8D38A. Model number: SB5100. They installed their own modem without my knowledge and took my modem. I made at least a dozen phone calls regarding this matter and never got return phone calls except once which in turn they left a return phone number that was unreachable for incoming calls. They sent me via US Mail a modem that is a Motorola but not my original one. The one they sent was used and an older model. The modem that is missing is valued at $100 and I would like a check for $100 or a $100 credit to my bill."
1,"Comcast has switched all their channels to digital which is what the government said they had to do, no more analog. With Comcast you have packages that you can choose from. I have a $63.00 package to my home. They did not issue me credit when they moved channels to digital and now that they have finished their transition I do not have service to one of my TVs. Comcast now requires you to have a DTA box on your TV in order for you to receive the channels you already pay for. But they only allow you to have three free boxes; each additional box is $1.99 a month added to your bill. I pay for a service to my home not to each individual TV and I am not getting it on one of my TVs. When I call them they want to tell you about all the different channels that you are now getting with these boxes. And that they really can't give me the other box for free and I would have to pay for it. I didn't ask for more channels. I asked for the service that I am paying for and now not getting because they want to charge me for the additional box. At the moment, I pay for service to my home and I am not getting it. Their customer service and some supervisors will tell you that they do not have a code for issuing a fourth box for free, but that they could give it to me for free for 6 months and from another supervisor for 12 months. I am not getting the service that I am paying for because I do not have the fourth box. And I don't need to pay them $1.99 more a month for service that I am already paying for. I am paying for service that I am not getting because Comcast said I needed to pay them for an additional box. I pay for the service to my home not to each TV."
1,"It was Superbowl weekend and suddenly at 3 p.m., Friday, I had only static. At first, I was not concerned as my account was up to date. At 5 p.m., I called some 800 number to see if there was a problem in the area. I was advised that it appeared that my area/building did have some problem but since I was the 1st call, a technician could not be called to investigate until 3 calls had been received. To try to shorten the saga, after two more calls, 9 p.m. and 12 a.m. by me, I was assured that a technician would have the problem repaired by 3 p.m. Saturday. The 3 p.m. came and went, still no cable. I did remember something odd on my door when I took my dog out Friday evening about some special Comcast was having with a name and number.When I called on Saturday afternoon, the representative was extremely rude telling me that my account was past due and my service had been shut off. I admit that when I paid my last bill, it may have been a few days after the due date but there was no service interruption or notice of any kind. I also had not yet received the next month’s bill as yet so I was up to date. Sunday a.m., I fished out that flyer that was on my door and called the guy. I left a message on his machine with the story of his flyer and suddenly, no service. Guess what? Monday a.m., this guy calls me at 8 p.m. that says he disconnected me by mistake and my service now was already working again. No apology from them. The rude customer service representative who by the way, said that the 1st appointment to get that service back would be Thursday. So let’s see. I had no cable from Friday, 3 p.m. until Monday, 8 a.m. I missed superbowl and had I not remembered the flyer in the garbage, I would have had no internet/cable for about a week."
1,"The nightmare continues with Comcast as they are totally incompetent and insensitive with respect to my problem. They will not address the route of the problem which could be a line issue and a power surge which causes the TV to revert to standby mode or there is a virus in the remote. Two weeks ago, a very adept technician was able to fix this problem over the [hone in 8 minutes. Two weeks later, the TV is frozen again which is very much like a computer when it freezes when a sociopath introduces a virus into your computer. I asked for a technician to come to my home to re-program the remote device and he comes over while I am not at home, not honoring the time agreed upon, removes a brand new perfect cable box and replaces it with an old refurbished box that smells as if it has been immersed in a pan of fried pork chops. I would not be surprised if the thing wasn't a roach motel. It looks and smells like it was pulled from the garbage. I have been without a TV for 2 weeks and these people have the unmitigated gall to expect me to pay for services I can't use? If I will try to downgrade, they refuse and say that they are not skilled that area. Why answer the confounded phone if you are not skilled? And then, they switched the contact phone number on my account and start to call my cell phone every 0.2 microns of a second reminding me about my technical appointment. When I call them back and beg them not to call the cell phone because I have to be the one who pays for the call, they assure me that it’s taken cared of and lo and behold, they call again. Then they would tell me that they have no record of an account for me and that I am someone else! I think that it would be pretty hard for me to become a man in 24 hours unless I have the ability to wave a wand and make it so! I honestly feel that with so many dissatisfied customers and the abusive way Comcast handles the populace, we need to band together, facilitate a petition and either replace the entire corporation with seasoned, competent professionals or have some venture capital association, buy Comcast out and run it like a professional organization or offer residents in America the extra options for cable choosing. I live in DC and Comcast is our only option. If enough people start petitioning and demanding change, maybe it would wake the corporation up and stop treating us like the baboons on the planet of the apes treated in Charleston Heston. I wonder how Comcast employees would feel if they were the recipients of such maltreatment."
1,"Once again, Comcast has tampered with my service by rendering the remote Xfinity device frozen so that the TV is inoperable.  I can't even turn it on manually.  I called the government office of Cable Television.  I got no help.  I have now sent a letter to the mayor, as I am desperate for help.  Their excuse for banishment is that they are in ""discussions"" about which TV shows they deem ""appropriate"" for me to watch, and if it is ""acceptable"" to ""allow me to watch TBN"".  And yet, they have the unmitigated gall to demand payment and threaten to terminate my phone service to the ability I can't call 911 in case of an emergency.  I need an attorney pro bono."
1,"Three years ago (2008), an ice storm broke the TV cable support loose at each end between my house and the pole, allowing the cable to lie on the ground.  Signals were still good so I didn't report it.  A year or more later (2009), Comcast called trying to sell additional services.  I asked the salesperson to report the cable problem to the proper department.  She said she would be happy to do so.  Apparently, she didn't because no one ever came out to re-tie it.  On Sunday, May 15 (2011), all Comcast cable channels suddenly became so snowy looking that we could no longer view pictures.  On Monday, at 2:30 pm, May 16, 2011, I reported the problem to Comcast and received a repair ticket number and service restore time of 24 hours.  On Tuesday, at 3:00 pm, May 17, 2011, I called for status.   ""Charles"", the man who answered, had difficulty finding the account.  He wanted to know how long we had the account.  I replied 35 years at this address.  I advised him the repair number that was assigned and he found it closed out.  There was no report as to why.  He promised to have the problem checked by outside cable repairmen with an ETA of repair 3 to 5 working days.  No ticket number will be assigned, because that department will give the report to the first available technician and there is no way they can estimate when that would happen.  On Wednesday, at 2:00 pm, May 18, 2011, my wife called repair to advise that we were without service and to try to speed the repairs.  She was told the same thing, that it would be reported to the first available technician in a 3 to 5 day time period.  On Thursday, at 8 pm, May 19, 2011, there was no sign of repairmen.  There’s still no TV picture.  On Friday, at 4:40 pm, May 20, 2011, there are no repairs yet and there’s still no picture.       "
1,"I am currently involved in a battle with Comcast over the restoration of my service. All of my services have been unavailable for over 36 hours at the time of this writing (from a neighbor's Bright House connection). I have made three separate calls to their customer service line, and each time the main customer service center is blaming this on the dispatch center. They continue to push notes to the dispatchers saying that this is urgent 24-hour-SLA service because I have no dial tone, but I've heard or seen nothing further. Yet I'm told I'm not allowed to know anything about the dispatchers, name, address, phone number. All I can do is complain to the service center management who ""promise"" to get on the issue with the managers of the dispatch center. I'm pretty much at the end of what I can do, short of cancelling my service, which is the next step.The real story here is that I came to Central Florida from Pennsylvania, the home of Comcast. Up there, they treat customers far better than they do down here. My concern is that this company is making inroads in the state of Florida (due to the Adelphia acquisition) yet abuses its customers here in many different ways, from Internet service data caps to not having enough service personnel contracted and available to resolve situations effectively. Even for routine service installations, they have been averaging 5-7 days from what I've dealt with down here, much longer than Bright House or other service providers, and way longer than the 1-2 days back in PA. I feel that Comcast should never have been allowed to operate in the state of Florida to begin with and should not be allowed to expand further without significant improvements to its systems and processes. Furthermore, HOAs and municipalities should be alerted to the issues that this company brings with it and the perils of negotiating with Comcast for service should be made known to them.I intend to bring this issue to representatives, both in Tallahassee and DC, in the hopes that if this company is to continue to be permitted to operate in this state, that it shape itself up to what it ought to be."
1,"In November of 2010, I noticed that my TV was cutting on and off every Sunday morning between 8 am - 11 am, and only for the channels 290 (TBN) and 33 (ION). At the time of these incidences, a white Comcast van is seek skulking through our alleyway at about 5 mph. I am a minister and enjoy the religious broadcast channels. Comcast insisted that the TV was the problem, and I knew that it was not. A subject matter expert indicated that the TV was frozen in standby mode.Comcast sent over two incompetent ** who looked to be no more than 14 years old. They brought a replacement box but refused to install it. After many shouting matches with these ** and spending four hours at one time on a chat line with someone who can neither read or speak English, they sent over a very good technician who fixed the problem. Well, it was short lived, 3 weeks. The same white Comcast van that was skulking by my apartment, stopping and looking in my apartment, showed up and my TV was rendered inoperable.An error message appeared on my cable box: ""Remove TBN"" and the TV was shut down. What these ** did was to program the Xfinity remote control with codes from the old defunct Comcast remote control device. This proves to me I have an enemy at Comcast, and it is highly probable an ex-boyfriend is the caveat behind working with an employee to get back at me for termination of an abusive relationship. This man has been stalking me for 7 years. Comcast is an evil, ruthless empire. Since they refuse to fix the problem they created, I wanted to disconnect my cable service. What idiot would pay for services they cannot use? Therefore, I am filing a complaint with the FCC. I had dangerously high blood pressure. I was so upset that my left eye is permanently drooped down due to the high blood pressure."
1,"The installation technician was argumentative, and never completed any paperwork or installation other than hanging a cable outside a window for temporary service. Why can't our complaints register with any of these providers and make a difference? Why do we have to complain and complain and complain to someone who doesn't seem to make things change?"
1,"I have spent countless months working to get a resolution to the issue at hand repeatedly explaining the situation and all I receive in return is apologies. Then, I'm given assurance that everything will be taken care of and resolved. It has been nearly 2 years and I have yet to hear back from anyone regarding my TV service being down for as far as I can remember.It is completely unsatisfactory for the way my account has been handled and no follow up has yet to be made on your part regarding corrections and getting the job done right in fixing a consistent TV issue that is apparently non-stop for the past 2 years. I have spoken with Sara ** at the presidential complaints department. After making the complaint, she stated someone is to call me by end of day. Please note that our conversation took place on 5/2/11 at 10:54 am. As of today 5/4/11 at 8:38am, I have yet to get a call regarding my complaint.There seems to be no accountability whatsoever and the kind of service I have been receiving speaks volumes on Comcast's disorganization and disrespect for their customers. The presiding issue and/or combination thereof, is aggravating, unsettling and infuriating. I expect that some action will be taken to overcome this disappointing experience and improve your practices to reflect more positively on a residential and small home business with such prominence as Comcast currently maintains."
1,"Roaches! Do not accept a refurbished or used cable box. We lived in our new house for several months and had never seen a roach. Then, after installing a refurbished Comcast cable box, we saw a roach run across the screen. On the next day, one was found beneath the entertainment center! I disconnected the box and took it outside. I called and demanded a new and not refurbished box. When it arrived, I installed it and have not seen another roach for six months. Do not accept a used cable box that has been in someone's roach-infested house!"
1,"I have absolutely had it with Comcast. Most recently I had an appointment to have them fixed an issue I reported earlier in the week. The operator I spoke with stated that there were no outages in my area and they had to send out a tech. So I stay home all day Saturday (cancelling plans) to wait. No one shows and when I called, they told me that there was an outage in the area and as such, they cancel their appointments when they fix an outage. Not to mention that they cancelled without a phone call. Also I have an issue with variable pricing. I live in a building with 220+ units and many people pay less or more for like services. Cannot seem to grasp that one!"
1,"My service was previously interrupted and on Thursday 3/24, I paid the total amount and brought my account current. I called Comcast customer service and a representative advised me my cable service would be restored in about 45 minutes. Once I returned from work later that evening and discovered my service was still not connected I immediately called Comcast again and this time was told there must be a splitter in the house that was preventing connection. Explained to the technician nothing was touched in fact everything was as before. He in return set an appointment for Sunday 3/37 between 8am and 11am. I later found out after speaking with about six more representatives, the appointment was actually scheduled for Saturday 3/26 which I was out of town. Comcast representative said there was no need for me to be at home for the technician to restore my service. When I returned late Saturday night, my service was still disconnected.Called Comcast again about 10 pm and the technician kept me on the phone troubleshooting and nothing resolved my problem. What really upset me today was when I spoke to Hector a technical support representative only to find out that someone initiated another visit to my home set for 3/31 without notifying me about the appointment. After explaining to Hector my dilemma and requesting some type of compensation from my inconvenience, he refused and began to sound like a bill collector by telling me I won't receive any credit because the amount I paid was the total amount. Advised Hector this situation can be dealt with at another time so what can be done about getting my cable reconnected. Hector explained that a technician came out to my home for the set appointment and I explained to him this was the incorrect date.But he kept repeating it over and over again ignoring my main issues of how to get my cable back on. I was treated very poorly and disrespectfully. Hector showed no empathy towards my situation but was rude and basically called me a liar and for me this is not acceptable. Please help me get someone's attention because it's evident that Comcast has lost sight of the ""Big Picture."" I also feel the commercial about how the customers come first and even offer a guarantee is bogus because I have received poor customer service from several Comcast representative within the last few days. Please help!"
1,"On 3-15 I placed an order with Comcast to provide me with telephone, internet and TV. I was told the equipment for my order would be at my house by 3-22. On 3-24, I still had not received my equipment. I called Comcast and asked the status. The agent said he would have to talk to his manager. He came back on the line and told me that the person that originally took my order had not released the equipment to ship. He told me as a result of Comcast error, he would ship the equipment overnight and I would have it on 3-25. He gave me a confirmation number and told me that I could track the shipment at Comcast.net.On 3-25 I went online for 20 min. and could not find any way to track my order. I called Comcast and after lots of waiting got a rep who told me that there is no way to track an order on Comcast.net. He transferred me to another department. The rep from the new department told me that the order was not shipped overnight and I would get it in 3-5 business days.I asked to talk to his supervisor who was Monik employee# Semo0610. Monik told me that Comcast did not have any equipment to ship due to their vender delays and that all orders in March had been delayed due to this. I asked Monik why none of the half-dozen Comcast employees I had spoken to had told me this. Instead they all said you will get your components in x-days.Monik could not tell me when the order would be shipped but it would not be before April. She then told me that I would need to go through the order release process all over again because this needed to happen again because the order was delayed. I asked to speak to her superior and was told that there was no person I could talk to and that Comcast managers do not receive or return calls. So right now, I have been lied to a number of times and I have no idea when I will get my equipment. This is not a way to run a company and I will not accept this kind of extremely bad service. I do not know when or if I will have phone service or internet."
1,"On March 25, 2011, I was on the phone with them for the past hour and still no resolution has been made - still on hold. I contacted Comcast to complain about a promised rate reduction that was to have taken effect Nov 9, 2010. The promise was for a $40 a month reduction in my bill for a period of 6 months. To date this rate reduction has not taken effect. I've been bounced around on the phone to 3 people now and I'm waiting for a supervisor. I have the entire chat room conversation documenting the promised rate reduction and nothing is being done. To date, I am out $160 as the promised rate reduction has not taken effect."
1,"I cancelled my account and was due a refund for the account. I gave my new address. I have called 6 times over the last three months, and every time, they tell me that they will cut a new check and give me a new date of two weeks. I still haven't received my money from them.I've spent over 650 minutes of my time and phone bill on them. I have yet to receive the money owed me."
1,"On February 17th, I was offered a bundle $39.99 per 12 months no contract plus $75 gift card for 12 meg. internet, free Norton antivirus, phone service with unlimited local and long distance, caller id, call waiting, voicemail, call forwarding and more and I would get to keep my phone number.  Comcast is refusing to honor this bundle that was offered to me and stated that at the time that bundle was not being offered.The results of several attempts to have this corrected have been partial.  I will receive the $39.99 per month for 12 months, no contract, but will not receive the $75 gift card.  It seems to me that Comcast is in the business of misrepresenting the truth to gain customers.  They do not honor their word and deceive consumers.  Something should be done about this. "
1,"Cable, phone and internet installed last August. The first 30 days are free if your service was not good and it was not. We had 4-5 service orders, not resolved. I cancelled service within the 30 days and continued to get billed for service and labor charges. I called 3-4 times to CS and asked them to remove all charges because we were within 30 days, nothing happened, I gave up. My account is now in collections and has affected my credit score. It's been 7 months and Comcast needs to zero my account and correct all three credit bureaus. Thank you."
1,"I recently called Comcast to discuss downgrading my cable to Extended. I told them it would be temporary. I also informed them that I would like to start using my own modem and router instead of renting one from them. I was told to bring in all of my equipment including the modem that I wished to use instead of Comcast's to my local (**) office. When I did as ask, the service representative first told me that I was misinformed; that no modem worked except for the one Comcast was renting to us. She said it was due to getting my cable TV and DSL through the same modem. I showed her that I had a cable modem; one that I had been assured would suffice, and she again said no, and that I must rent one from Comcast.Then, she picks up my standard DVR off the counter and says that no one is allowed stnd. DVRs any longer and that she had to take it. I said, ""Wait. No, I want to keep it."" She said I had to either pay for an HD DVR or go to a reg. cable box for $8.99 (I pay $ 9.99 for my DVR). I said no way and she ignored me and whished it away to another room.I asked to speak to someone else, and finally, she called up someone who ended up telling her that I could keep my DVR, and he then gave her an authorization code which she entered into my account. But, when she went to retrieve my DVR, she came out with a new one, saying it took less time to enter the information she needed with a new one instead of my old one. I had over 30 hours of recording on it and it was all set up. She also ""lost"" my remote and gave me another one while acting p/o because the supervisor allowed me to keep my DVR.The last straw was when I asked for the one free cable box that comes with the extended basic. She told me that I didn't get a free cable box and that I had to pay for my DVR and also for the cable box. I asked her for the adapter, which Comcast states on their site is free, to allow TVs to get channels 25-75. She said there was no such a device and that my only option was to either pay for both boxes or simply watch only the analog channels on the TV in the living room.Do I have any recourse to force Comcast to provide a free cable box per their own advertising or is this the penalty I have to pay for having stood my ground regarding my DVR? If I am downgrading my cable so I can be a responsible customer and ensure I don't have services I can't pay for, then it follows that I can't afford to be paying for cable boxes and modems that either I already have or that Comcast promises to provide for free. What is up with that?"
1,"I had been a Comcast customer for over two years when I moved in December. I wanted to transfer the service to my new home, but was unable to be there for the new installation, so my nephew was there. I wanted the same service I had previously had. Instead, I became a new customer, was charged an activation fee, got a bundle package including a phone number which I cannot use as I have a MagicJack phone and a cell phone. I was told the installation fee at my new home was, I believe, approximately $60.00.The last bill from my previous residence was just under $77.00. The next bill (January) at my new address was over $500.00! I was outraged and didn't pay it as I tried to find out what all the charges were for from several customer service reps. The next bill rolled up to $610.00! Now I am getting messages on my new top-of-the-line TV sets that I need a digital converter! Something else to pay for?Yesterday I paid $550.00 due to a termination notice, even though I have no idea how the bill ever got to that size. I would have really disputed this bill except for the fact that I just had two leg surgeries and a wrist surgery last week. It's hard to fight when you're under the weather. My sister in Florida gets lots of TV channels using only rabbit ears and no cable. You can't do that in NJ because all you get is snow on the screen and I've heard the cable companies have blocked the signals so it's impossible to get free TV. This is a disgrace. I told Comcast I was going to complain about this. How is it nobody at Comcast can explain such a large bill to me? I would need a forensic accountant to be able to figure it out."
1,"For the past 2 years we had been subscribing to Comcast's basic television service. About 4 months ago I decided to upgrade to a Comcast Digital Economy plan. In the plan description I was to get almost every channel, with the exception of HBO, Showtime, etc. About 1 month into service I randomly stopped receiving Nickelodeon, the History Channel, TLC & TBS to name a few. When I called to complain they just said they took away those channels with no real explanation given. I accepted this answer, as it wasn't too big of a deal since we still had On Demand service and my son could watch his Nick shows, etc. Well, just a few weeks ago I realized they have now taken away our On Demand service for these channels since we ""are not subscribers"". Never once was this told to me. I'm tired of them making us pay more and more for less and less services."
1,I've tried to cancel my Comcast services and haven't been able to. They either put me on hold or hung up on me after an hour of waiting. They should be punished for their unethical practices regarding cancellation of their services.
1,"On average for the past three months, I have been having internet issues. About three months ago, I was having disconnection issues, I called Comcast numerous times to have them re-prevision the speeds on the modem; sometimes they work and it would last a few hours but then the speeds would drop back down again. Then, I called back a third time and they told me my account settings was incorrectly noted for my speeds. They fixed it and I didn't have any trouble till about a month ago.I started having major outages here in our area, and my next door neighbor was having issues as well .They always seem to have issues maintaining their networks. Well, close to two weeks ago, Comcast started doing some Node 46617 area work where they upgraded the system. I didn't know what they upgraded for a while but ever since the work was done, I have been having nothing but problems with a connection or even speeds to work with me.I pay $93 a month with TV usage of basic which is $20 for others and I'm paying so much money and regular price for internet I can barely even use. For 13 days straight I have had intermediate speeds of anywhere from 9.83Mbps to 14.29 Mbps down stream, and my upstream has been anywhere from 0.01 Mbps to 1.87 Mbps.The upstream has been so erratically slow to the point that I cannot even send data packets to anything like my PC ER client's to my contractor for PC networking jobs. For about a week and a half dealing with this problem, I have been calling several times. I must at least make a count of 14 total calls through out the week and 27 online instant chat sessions with the Comcast company.Three of them I have been completely ditched and disconnected from them with out any response or resolve and left me out in the dark with no internet connection at all. The client support service is horrible. I have had technicians from their department say that my modem was bad to my lines might be bad. I have had technician come out here and find nothing wrong except for one technician that saw pictures of my log files showing at times when the internet would drop to literally nothing.I pay $20.00 under $100.00 a month for service that is should contain speeds of 20.00 - 25.00 Mbps down stream, and up stream speeds of anywhere from 2.00 - 4.00 Mbps. I don't even get 2.00 Upstream speed anymore, it's always 0.01- 0.63 Mbps.Now, I have a technician coming over Monday to make the drops because of the tech yesterday on Saturday failed to make a line drop repair call before leaving the job site and closing the case. I am tired of the horrible customer support that is given and the poor illiterate technicians that continue to come here and not do full tests of everything for a period of time longer than they are supposed to. This problem is a obvious thorn in my business.The only good they have done for me so far was giving me some back charge credit for the loss of my services and inconveniences. But there should be no reason this should take nearly half a month just to resolve an issue that shouldn't be there to begin with ever since they upgraded our area. One of the technicians told me they had bind all four traffic networks of South Bend and Mishiwaka all together.I don't know what they were thinking, but I went to Michiana College for IT technology and PC repair with computer electronics. I know networking and I build networks for two companies here in the Saint Joseph region.  It is common sense that if your are going to bind four branches together, you must have more powerful servers to handle the in and out bound traffic that happens 24/7 and they obviously made a huge mistake combining their nodes. Now clients all over the Saint Joseph area are trying to connect and request and send data and there is nothing but a bottle neck here.I am not the only one with Comcast issues. I have gone to the Comcast service station at 1920 E. McKinley Ave. in Mishiwaka and there was a self employed gentleman that was furious because of the lousy service he has been getting.I am going to include two logs that I have had with Comcast online representatives that I spoke with. Some of the information you will find shocking and please excuse my language ** , but all of this has caused me to loose operating system build jobs and custom requests for custom PC building to my clients and I have lost clients as well as Mark and I together in an excess damages of an average sale of but not limited too, PC repairs, customs, networking, operations in total loss of an average ($1,200.00 this past two month), data loss for our clients online storage bin, and also not to mention I had to close down my broadcasting radio station and hosting services for two software companies that I serve.I even lost data from sending emails to client and family members. Pictures and other documents have been lost in emails and I have not been able to gain access to government documents for tax season as well as filing taxes and job searching for my god father Frank.I've had loss of sales, data and government data in coming and out going requests. Personal data have failed to be sent and received. The loss of orders due to being unable to connect to Microsoft's servers and IT information servers to get operating system upgrades and other data protocols used to manage with my clients. "
1,"Last January 13th, I established a new business telephone service with Comcast.  My line was installed by your technician due to incompatibility with my Vonage service, especially since the new cable TV transition.  I went to your office to finalize my transition on January 14th.  I told the customer service representative that the technician came to my house, installed the line and gave me a new number.I could make calls without any problems so I contacted my family members to let them know of my new number.  I called my relatives in Cincinnati, Atlanta, Marilyn, California and New York.  I contacted old and current clients, as well as client prospects, via phone and email to assure be sure that they all had the new number because I was in the middle of a project or negotiations with them.  On January 14th through the 18th, I could receive calls, make calls and I was in and out all day.  It didn't occurred to me that I was not receiving any calls until the police showed up at my door around 9pm on the 18th, said that my friend in Cincinnati was worried and wanted them to check to make sure I was doing fine.  Some man was answering my old line and my new number was out of service.  I called my son in New York the same evening he said that he had been trying to call me and became concerned because the old number went to a residential phone in an 831 area code and the new number was saying that you have reached a number that is no longer in service service.  How embarrassing!I immediately contacted my current clients to let them know that I was having phone problems and I was told by one that we will wait until you get your financials in order.  The only thing I could do was to call and apologize to the others.  Their demeanor were all the same.I was so wrapped up in trying to meet my financial obligations that I neglected to phone my cousins, who came by my house Saturday morning last January 22nd to let me know that my uncle had passed that morning.  My cousins said they tried to reach me when he took a turn for the worse on Friday afternoon but was unable to do so.I was on the phone with your customer service for hours Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  Each took the opportunity to call both numbers to confirm my story about the two telephone numbers but no one could help me.  Today is Tuesday the 25th of January, and I still cannot receive calls.  The new number is still saying you have reached a number that is no longer in service. Comcast has managed to destroy my business reputation with one clean swoop.  I am so devastated at this time that I can hardly breath, sleep or eat.  I am a new business owner, struggling in a suffering economy and have barely been able to stay afloat.  I am in no position to compensate for your service malfunction.  I am embarrassed to no end from having the police come to my door, yet grateful that my friend was concerned enough to send them.  I have no savings.  I have maxed out both my bank account and my credit card in an attempt to pay my bills.  I have lost approximately $2,500++ in one week.  I am filing a formal complaint with you because I feel you owe me more than a credit on my account.  If I am able, I will need to clean up this mess you have created for me in order to keep my business going.  Instead of spending more hours on the phone trying to resolve this problem myself, I decided to write this letter, to just be put off again.I know a great deal about your company through my research.  I grant research for non-profit organizations.  I'm sure your founder and Chairman Emeritus at Comcast Corporation would be appalled by the poor representation of such a prestigious organization such as yours.Per advice, I have to make all effort to contact executive officers, to see if this can be resolved internally.  I was told by your customer service and technicians that my service is in a transition period.  12 days and counting is negligence.  I have spent 10 hours of my time attempting to get help.  As of 9:09pm, after talking to a representative for 4 hours, my service is still the same. I Want Compensation for the lost income, loss of clients, hours spent on the phone, sleepless nights, depressing days, anxiety, rage, aggravation; clients withdrawing their business, loss of my business reputation; distressing family and friends, not being able to receive any calls, hospitalization (high blood pressure February 17, 2011), changing information on my business cards and other documents, sending letters of complaint regarding the ongoing neglect and miscommunications from Comcast Executive officers for 6 weeks."
1,"Comcast's system made a mistake in October 2010, upgrading my service without my authorization. I called every month trying to fixed the issue (every time, I was told that the problem has been fixed and I should see the changes online within the next 48 hours, but of course it never happened).As of February 2011, the billing issue has been fixed, finally. Yet yesterday (2/16/2011), my service got disconnected, with the reason that ""credits made by account manager cannot take care of the past due amount (because of comcast system design? )""To continue using the Comcast service, I need to pay for the amount caused by system error. For all the times I asked to talk to a supervisor/manager, they will send you to voice-mail or take your number but never call back"
1,"A service was added to my account without my authorization. I did not realize this until the bill arrives and a $100 charge was added. After contacting Comcast the representative indicated a request was made on December 16th to add additional the service. I made no such call. The only call I made during this period was due to a cable box issue. The box is always going out, and I never received the box I am paying for, which is a DVR (this has been going on for 3 years).The Comcast representative could offer no proof of the request other than to say it was made by a man. Since I would be that man I know no such request was made. Comcast would not remove the charges so I paid $100 for a service I did not request or take advantage of. How can they get away with this? I bet there was a promotion going on and the customer service representative I talked to about my cable box issue added the service to get credit for a sale. This is theft, pure and simple."
1,"I entered into a contract for Triple Play with Comcast. After 6 months of service, Comcast extended the rates for this service for an additional 6 months. Comcast's invoices went up 50% immediately after the offered extension. I continued making payments based on the extended offer. Comcast cut off my service, reported this on my credit rankings, and sold an unpaid balance to a 3rd party collection agency. However, based on the extension of the promotional rate, payments made on my account exceeded the amount that would have been due (if the invoices had reflected the extension) by $89.49.Additionally, I am due a refund for the return of the converter box and remote. Credit rating has been affected due to nonpayment of account. Third party collection agency has been trying to collect. I have a frustration with Comcast having addressed this issue twice in person at the local office and now twice with customer service. Three out of these four contacts resulted in Comcast telling me that a refund would be forthcoming; one even providing me a ticket number for the refund. However, during a subsequent call to Comcast, I was informed that Comcast had no record of my conversation or the supposed refund ticket."
1,"On 12/29/10, I had internet and cable installed.  Since it was a very rainy day, he got here hours late.  To compensate me for my time, he called and got approval for compensated services.  I have in writing that the total would be $29.99.  When I received my first bill, I was being charged $173.80 more!  I called Comcast and let them know.  I faxed the info they requested.  So far, I have faxed this info to them 3 different times.  On January 25, Ebony from customer service told that someone from tech support would call me that day.  I'm still waiting for their call.  All I want is to have this corrected so I can pay my bill on time!  Thank you."
1,"I have a two-year agreement for a triple bundle, which total price is $114.09 for the first year, and $10.00 more for the second year. I asked over and over before I took this agreement, if I would still get all my TV channels on all my other TVs without any additional cost. They said I would still get everything I had, and I would not have to get a box for each. Now they want $1.99 plus tax and fees for each additional TV over the first two. I have five.What's worse is they raised the price of my modem to $2.27 per month and said that's not part of my agreement. My bundle is for phone, TV, and internet. Without the modem, I can't get phone or internet, so how can that not be part of the agreement?! It seems no matter how many times you read a contract and asks questions, these companies always find a way to wiggle out of the deal."
1,"I am writing about my disappointment in the DTA migration decision.  I have been a dedicated customer for over 20 years.  I was originally under the impression that this would be a good thing, as I own a digital-capable HD television.  Comcast stated that it is an upgrade.  We are experiencing not the high quality picture that you advertised.  Since not all stations are HD, all others are fuzzy because of the pixels, as well with hesitations.  How is this improving your network?With our original basic plan, we were receiving stations such as 14/23/26/29/33/50-57.  You are advertising that there are extra channels.  However, it removed about the same amount of broadcast channels.  The new library of stations is nonsense and absurd.  It seems that Comcast is trying to extort their customers by upgrading for additional stations we were already getting.  This is unacceptable and brings me to go to Verizon or another satellite provider, especially through times of hardships for persons who are unemployed (myself).  And my father also has the basic and only collects social security and his housebound.  The additional costs for the promotions, even though you do not think it may be a large cost, is a substantial difference for others. You quote, “We want our customers to be amazed with the choice Comcast offers.”  Well please, let me know what that is when you have it.  You are not holding up your end of the bargain of the Comcast customer guarantee, as your promise.  We are not receiving the superior customer experience from Comcast.  I know you wish to maintain a good reputation for Comcast.  Thank you for your attention to this matter."
1,"I am on Social Security on a fixed income and was promised a fixed rate. I am now trying to be overcharged for my service, as well as faulty and unprofessional handling of my service and equipment."
1,"Comcast's television advertisements claim the company provides outstanding customer service and that their word is good. Actually, their word is terrible. Case in point. Abruptly one morning before Christmas, I lost Internet service to all of our home computers, which includes a WiFi. I checked all of the Internet settings on my computer. They were all correct. I reset the router and modem, but there was no improvement. I restarted my computer and there was no change.I called Comcast Customer Support and after waiting several minutes for an agent, the person who answered asked for my name and phone number and assured me he would fix my problem. After 20 minutes, during which he seemed to be reading from a checklist of questions to ask me, he said he was going to transfer me to another agent who specialized in my kind of problem. Actually my kind of problem was that I was dealing with Comcast employees who had no idea what they were doing. The second agent asked me all of the same questions as the first agent. She said she understood that it was frustrating when my Internet didn't work and she was sorry about that. It sounded as though she was reading that from her checklist. It turns out this agent was a contractor with Net Gear, the maker of the router Comcast had installed in my house. She assured me she would definitely fix my problem. She told me to take the battery pack out of the modem and wait 60 seconds, then reinstall it. I did so and nothing changed. After half an hour or so, she said she was going to transfer me to another agent who would definitely help me with my problem. The fourth agent said the cable from my modem to router was defective and said I should go to an electronics store and purchase a new ethernet cable, which I did at Radio Shack. I installed it, again nothing improved. I still had no Internet service. I called Net Gear- Comcast Support number again, and spoke with the fifth agent who was also a Net Gear contractor. He read the same list of questions from his checklist, which I had already answered four times previously and after assuring me that he would absolutely, positively and definitely solve my problem, which he said was probably very frustrating (he was fairly good at reading the same script), he transferred me to the sixth person. This time the support staff member was woman who sounded as though she was from India or Pakistan by her accent. I assume Net Gear out sources their support line to a company based in South Asia because they believe there are no Americans who know anything about computers, or maybe Americans expect to be paid a reasonable wage. She also assured me that absolutely, positively she would solve my problem. She was much more knowledgeable than any of the other earlier checklist readers with whom I had spoken. She patiently tracked down the problem and actually solved it within about a half hour to 45 minutes, which involved switching cables, reinstalling the IP address and changing the port number. She did not just read from a list of questions. I was on the phone for a total of four hours with six different Comcast or Net Gear customer support employees in order to solve my Internet failure problem. Once my network was up and running, she asked me if I was happy with her assistance and whether I needed any other help, very polite indeed. Then she insulted me by asking me to complete an online service quality evaluation form based solely on her assistance. She said I should not take into consideration the failure of the previous five checklist readers to solve my Internet outage problem. Comcast's word is utterly worthless.I have had no significant Internet outages since shortly before Christmas, but I have had to change my blood pressure medication dosage."
1,"Comcast scammed my money. They do whatever they want without my consent. I was using economic tier in September 2010 for $29.99. Then, I asked them the cable, the agent said it only cost $39.99 and my internet is still $29.99. However, they sent me a bill for cable for about $200. I wasn't satisfied with the service so I canceled it before 30 days and I got the bill statement, the cable payment didn't get canceled. I called several times to the customer service, she said they were fixing it. After that, they charged me late fees when they were still fixing the bill. I did not get their billing statement on the mail, they just disconnected my internet. When I did not get their mail and after they fixed it, they shouldn't have charged me late fees; but they did. So I paid $5 to reconnect the internet and paid on the phone, cost me another $5.99 dollars. The reconnection fee is $5 dollars. I thought that I was paying for the internet service that I had before which cost me $70 dollars, the economic tier for $29.99, but it wasn't. Now, I got the billing statement. It charged me $241 for the internet. The bill statement is very unclear about the internet billing. They scammed my money for all those late fees, reconnect and disconnect fees plus the internet fees. Actually on the billing statement, they didn't cancel the cable bill and they just said it is the internet bill. Please help!"
1,"Today January 17, 2011, I spoke with a Customer Service Representative Laquandria about the equipment issue. She told me the work order has 2 small boxes. I told her either the person that typed the work order made a mistake or stole the box, or maybe the installer stole the box.I asked Customer Service Reps. for written confirmation that I have 2 cable boxes only. Nothing has been resolved about this equipment issue.I, Glenda ** have 2 cable boxes only, one with VOD Access and one free small box, Serial number TM4014106129. I found out that Comcast has on record that I have 3 boxes. One box with VOD Access and 2 free small boxes. I never had 2 small boxes. I can't believe Comcast has insulted and falsely accused me of having a 3rd box.My family was here the day of installation and will witness I had and have 2 cable boxes only. I will send a copy of this letter to the Better Business Bureau, Public Service Commission, Comcast Corporate Office and my Attorney. I am going to contact the local TV networks about this matter. I am so insulted about this equipment matter."
1,"I went to the Comcast store in Boca Raton, this morning. There were 50-60 mostly elderly people waiting to be seen by, usually, only 3 technicians in the heat. Each meeting took about 5-10 minutes so we are talking at least a 2-3 hour wait.It is no surprise that the snowbirds are back and Comcast knows this. Yet, they still have few technicians to help this group. How can they get away with this, and since, is it quite obvious that they have a relative monopoly in this area for something people want, how can they be held accountable to acceptable consumer standards?"
1,"Comcast has encrypted channels 80 and 81. This means that a customer must have a Comcast box which incurs a fee in order to view these two channels. The channels are a part of the ""Digital Starter Package"". All other channels are viewable at this level without the company's box. This is a blatant violation of FCC regulations."
1,"I ordered xfinity service and I have still not received my phone service and it's been over a month. They are trying to get me to fix the problem and it's been impossible. No return phone calls as promised from supervisors, etc."
1,"I cancelled my account in November. When bringing back my equipment, I was told I ordered a router in September and I need to return it. I stated I didn't order it nor received it. They said they have evidence that it was received by UPS (without a signature). They did say the router was never activated. Ironically, I purchased my own router after having issues a few months earlier and was never offered a free router. After speaking with Yolanda **, an account manager with Comcast, she said not to worry about it and asked for a receipt for the router I purchased and agreed to reimburse me $139 for the last month plus an extra $50 for the router and I should receive a check within 4-6 weeks.After waiting 7 without a check, I called and was told I need to file a claim with UPS for the lost router before they would send my check. No one at Comcast said I needed to do this but I called UPS on 12/27 and they told me it was Comcast's responsibility to contact UPS, not mine. I don't feel Comcast gets to keep my money for a router I never ordered and was going to be given to me at no cost. If I had their equipment, I would give it back. There is no evidence I signed for it nor activated it and I want my refund!"
1,"For the past 4 months, I have had major problems with my phone; calls get forwarded to my son's or a business without me doing anything. There was also a period where calls where blocked, and then the phone did not work at all. Now after numerous visits by Comcast, the problem continues. Calls get forwarded to my son's house even though I have called Comcast many times. One of their technicians was here and I called and told them. The following 2 days, I had to call again, still no result. Some people are getting to the point they don't want to call me. Where do I turn to get this mess fixed? Comcast had gotten too big. They really don't care if your phone, etc., work or not, just pay them. Well, I'm fighting back and I need all the help I can get. I don't think it is too much to ask for your phone to work."
1,"We had Comcast promotional pricing from November 21, 2009 to December 21, 2010. Our high speed internet price was $29.99 and our Digital Preferred cable was $39.99 and our bill would be around $78 per month after taxes and fees. I called Comcast on December 9th to downgrade our cable to Local Basic, which was $21 a month and keep our internet the same. I was told that would be $39.99, so our bill would be about $65 after taxes and fees. During this conversation I was told that if I keep everything the same and did not downgrade, the bill would be $94.95 before taxes and fees. I refused that and an appointment for a tech to come out and remove our cable box was set up for December 18, 2010. On December 13, 2010, someone from Comcast called me and said they would extend my promotional pricing for another six months. I went over the price with her three times, $29.99 for internet and $39.99 for cable, and agreed to the promotional pricing for another 6 months.On December 21, 2010, I received my bill in the mail for $5.25 which I knew was not correct because it was only for the modem rental. At 8:30 am on December 22, 2010, I called Comcast billing and was told that the $5.25 bill was correct and my next bill would be for $150. I explained about the Comcast call to me on the 13th and how my promotional pricing was to continue for another 6 months. Of course, the billing person could not help me and after being transferred about 6 times, I finally spoke with Monique in the Silver Spring, MD Customer Retention Department.I explained all of this to her and she tells me that there is nothing in the system of someone from Comcast calling me on the 13th offering to extend my current promotional pricing; therefore, they would not honor it and my bill would be $150. I told her there was no way I was paying that and that I wanted to downgrade. She tried to sell me some other promotions, to which I said absolutely not. I want the local basic cable for $21 and the internet for $39.99 and supposedly she put all of that in the system. Now I have someone scheduled to come to my house on December 24th to remove my cable box and downgrade my service. I went over the new charges with Monique three times as well and told her how incredibly disgusted I am with Comcast and they should not have people calling customers offering to extend promotional pricing and then that never happens. I asked to speak with a manager and she said, ""This phone call is recorded and my supervisor will listen to it,"" but never actually transferred me to a manager.I'm totally disgusted and frustrated with Comcast. If I did not absolutely need the internet to work from home, then I would definitely not have the service. It's a shame Comcast has a monopoly in my market. You never talk to the same person twice and something is always messed up. When we originally got the service in November 2009, it took 4 months to get our bill straightened out because they were charging us for stuff we did not ask for. They have terrible customer service and nothing is consistent. It all depends on who you talk to that day and you'll probably never talk to them again when you call back. What a sorry excuse for a company—totally disgusted!"
1,"We were convinced by a sales rep from Comcast to upgrade our Comcast TV service to their DVR services. The unit is most probably defective because: We have to keep calling in to reset our service since we get blank screens It does not record a scheduled program from the beginning though we are setting the recording up properly. The online program directory has disappeared from our service, so we are not able to see a program schedule, though this is supposed to be included in our service.We scheduled a repair and the technician was to show up between 2pm and 5pm to repair or replace our unit. We confirmed by phone when they called using an automated system that indeed we still needed service. We were here all day waiting for the technician to call and by 2:45pm, since they had not called to tell us they were coming over, we called Comcast.They said our service call had been cancelled, and could give us no explanation why! Our only alternative was to reschedule at their earliest convenience, which is 3 days from now. Of course, we scheduled a service call from 2pm to 5pm again, but have no real faith that they will show up or even call without cancelling us for any reason again."
1,"I am having an issue with Comcast and basically have no where to turn. I have a 15 year son who lives with my parents at 2430 Garfield Ave in West Lawn (Reading) His dad, Eric ** abandoned him when he was 2 years old and only came back into his life 8/2009. To make up for being gone he bought him anything he wanted.Well, my son wanted Xbox live. So, Eric ** had a Comcast account in his name put into my parent home on Garfield Ave 9/2010 for internet only, the only device that used the internet was the Xbox game system, there is no computer in the home. Eric himself has never lived on Garfield Ave. He only had the internet service installed there for his son who is 15 yeas old. He (Eric) told both me and my parents, that he gave Comcast his debit card information for automatic payments.On 12/14/10, my son had a problem getting his game to work, so we assumed it was a troubleshooting problem so we call Comcast. They then advised us it was shut off for non payment! There was no payment on the account since it was opened. We had no idea since we 1) never received a bill at the Garfield Ave address, 2) never received a shut off notice at the Garfield Ave address and 3) never received a courtesy call at the Garfield Ave address. Now, my father being 62 years old with perfect credit told Comcast he would get an account in his own name. They refused him service and told him he would need to pay Eric's bill, which is over $300! So, I then called Comcast on 12/14/10 at 6pm and spoke to a Phil in the Lebanon office, rep# 95H. I explained the situation to him and he told me all my father had to do was go into the Comcast office with his ID and a utility bill in his name for the property and Comcast would give him a new account without making him pay the bill under Eric's name.Well, My father went into Comcast, only to be humiliated and treated like a dead beat and was told he will not be able to obtain service with Comcast until the bill is paid. My father has perfect credit, in 62 years not 1 bill has ever been paid late! He called me upset beyond words. I then called Comcast and spoke to a supervisor, Sherry, in my local Comcast office, she told me this is a domestic dispute between me and my husband?I was never married to him and nor do I believe it is a domestic dispute. She told me the person who used the service is resp, this would be my 15 year old! She then said my father, who does not play Xbox nor does he have a computer in his home is responsible for the bill! So, my next step was I called the corporate office and spoke to a Rhonda, and she also advised me the ""household"" is responsible!Now I am fully aware that people try and play games and ""get over"" on utility companies. I work at the utility company myself in the credit department and I see it everyday. However there are situations that this is simply not the case and the people in the household should not be held responsible for the balance of a debt.Senate bill 677 makes any adult occupant responsible for a utility debt when they benefited from service. I understand that Comcast is not a governed utility, however the basic situation is the same here. My father had no idea the bill was not being paid, and he did not use the Comcast service. He is 62 and does not play video games, and does not own a computer.I do not feel as though it is fair or right that Comcast is telling him and myself that we are responsible for a balance. I have talked till I was blue in the face with Comcast and they did not care. We are responsible people, we pay our bills. However I do not feel as though we should be made responsible for paying a bill that is not ours. If you could please assist me in this matter, it would be greatly appreciated! "
1,"I have called for several months concerning the service to my Cable Service. I thought if I scheduled to add on internet and phone, I would get special attention. My fault, it obviously doesn't mean anything to get more work because I still don't even have anyone trying to help me get someone here to figure out why I don't have any of those services! You would think someone would be backing up these service calls to see why things have not progressed? I have told the service reps what the other ones have said, but no one seems to care as they revert to a note that was put in forever ago. At least one note made it and all I want is cable to come in and that I receive and can hear it without it skipping words and going on and off! Everyone of my TVs do this so it is not just my TV, they are all different brands so that is not it. This has been going on for years. We travel a lot, and when I return from trips I don't have that kind of time to spend hours on a phone to wait for someone to pick up and make an appointment for 2 weeks out because I know I will be leaving again. So when I know I am going to be home, I make the effort and when I finally have the call I started back in Sept., the lady told me they would ""refresh"" my cable so I had to unplug all my lines to TVs (even the ones behind massive wall furniture, which was insane!) and they would work fine within a few hours. How easy, not!She got to hang up, only for me to have to go through the same routine of getting back on the phone, spending several hours more to finally get someone to speak with and waste another few hours to get the same response and the same requests to do. Who has this kind of time to blow? OK. And it doesn't work again, so now back on and they are going to send someone. I think adding on services will get me more attention. No such luck. Each cable guy has a different excuse of why he can't do anything, but not to worry because he will record a detailed report and the next guy will know exactly what to do. This never happens! Comcast doesn't even have what each one says nor all the different times I have called. I recorded the dates. Now I am taking down names and # of each so I have exact info. If I could have another company for cable I would in a moment, to get these guys out of my house. I hate incompetence. Please let me know if there is any or maybe not have TV at all. I am exhausted with all of this, I have another wasted day of hours on the phone only to hear I need to do it again on Friday (12/17) because they can't do today. I am telling her what the other guy said to do, but she is says it's not recorded so we will probably be repeating this on Friday. How is it that a company so large has this type of disorganization, incompetence and disregard for public service? Why should they care? There is no one to compete against, the market is theirs. They are horrible! Comcast needs a wake up call. Am I the only one that can't get through? Consequences are high blood pressure, marriage under pressure because every 3rd to 5th word doesn't come through, the picture goes on and off, we are not receiving his favorite channel (whatever Morning Joe is on). So come 5:30am, I have to listen to him screaming about how I am not hard enough on the cable people to get this simple job done! The stress of this stupid TV puts everyone in a bad mood! The time I have spent on the phone waiting, I could have made a week's pay by now. Needless to say, the days I have missed work for some joker cable guy come to tell me he can't do the job because he is not equipped and will leave detailed notes for the next guy so he will be ready and then have the next one tell me the same story. Poor service, disorganized communications, and horrific customer service."

1,"I moved from one apartment to another in the same bldg. The work order shows that existing equipment was transferred to new apartment, one box removed and 1 dvr was brought to the new apartment. I was accused of keeping the box and charged $400. Every time I call, I'm issued an imaginary ticket and told that they do not look at the work order. The service was cut off on 11/17/10. It was then restored and I proceeded to deal with one rude and incompetent customer service person. I want this problem resolved, this has been going on since 8/30/10. Because of this, I had no internet service, which I need for work."
1,"Comcast should be ashamed to call themselves a business. I have not been able to view any videos on my internet. Upload speed .48. They drop out TV programs and the list goes on and on for more than a year. Numerous telephone calls to customer service. What a joke. All they know how to say is I am sorry and we appreciate your business. Why can't a customer get an address for corporate headquarters?I had faster service years ago from AOL. Every time Comcast supposedly upgrades their overall service mine goes down. I wish some class action suit could be taken against them. If I had another option for internet, I would use it. The consequences have been loss of use of internet and no TV guide that I pay for with TV package. So much to say and it would take too long to write. My advice to anyone: do not use Comcast."
1,"From the beginning of this year until now, I have been reporting bad cable services (all three products). So far there has been a lot of unprofessionalism with Comcast. I do have video of my problems: bad reception, phone cuts off when I am on phone and there’s very slow internet speed."
1,"I have a complaint on the display of the National Geographic Channel (273) on basic cable. The edges are cut off. We see it during the whole program Sunday evening from 5 pm to 8 pm during the Iran War, same thing repeated at 8 pm Sacramento time. Graphics and titles which appear on the edges were partial, including the NAT GEO graphic in the right side corner."
1,"This is sample of In-line Chat in August, 2010 with Comcast Live Support:""Me :I chatted yesterday with a support person because my phone lines went down. Today I can make a call but the conversation is clear than garbled. It comes and goes.Support : ""You are most welcome. I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. I will be more than willing to check on that for you. To ensure the integrity of your account information. May I please have the Full Account Name and complete home address? Also, please provide me your 16 digit account number or the last 4 digits of your Social Security Number.""Then : Due to a network disruption, the message ""2380"" has not been sent. Please try again.After resending info, Support: Thank you. Please allow me to check on some notes here now. Allow me to pull up your account. Please allow me 2-3 minutes to run a diagnostics test, please take note that the services maybe interrupted as well when processing the tests.Me: I copied and pasted my conversation from yesterday if it helps. The support agent yesterday told me I would not have any more issues! And then :Well, I just lost phone service !Due to a network disruption, the message ""well I just lost phone service! "" has not been sent. Please try again.Support :Oh I see, That's fine. I am checking on the notes on the account.""I've multiple tickets and multiple visits and no one can correct the problem I have made numerous calls and chats in between these! This is impacting my husband's business and I have an 82 year old mother that I take care and I'm worried that we can't have a phone conversation without interruption."
1,"So we decided after 3 years of having dish and constant interruptions of service when the wind changed direction that we would switch to Comcast -- so we contacted Comcast and they came out to hook us up. What a fiasco that was ever since February we have had nothing but problems with the signal and we keep getting free demand movies, especially when it storms out. Anyway they have been out here to the house ummm 6 or 7 times since February and have yet to fix the problem and our cable bill keeps going up and up and up. The last technician out here told us that the maintenance department is short staffed and that a lot of customers are unhappy and having the same problems, yet nothing is being done. I don’t know what else to do. And yet I’m still being charged uhg - maybe direct TV?"
1,"A Comcast technician came to my home today to disconnect service, they asked my neighbor to let them in. I do not have any Comcast service. I spent 45 minutes on line with their disconnection department five times. He asked for my account # five times. I told him ""I don't have an account with Comcast."" He then put me on a ""short hold"" for 12 minutes then I got put through to the Spanish speaking department! I am quite sure he did that deliberately. What a totally useless company Comcast is. I would never trust this company and if they ever enter my property again I will call the police. Go dish."
1,"Back on April 13, 2010, I spoke to Michael in Customer Service regarding my Comcast cable bill. I had noticed that it appeared I was paying for 3 cable boxes when in reality, I only had 2 on hand. I was told that yes, I was being charged for 3. When I told him that I returned our third box months ago, he said it didn’t show anything in their system and then he would put a ticket in and someone would get back to me within 24 to 48 hours. Then on July 27, they finally returned my call and said they couldn't find the box. I would have to find the receipt. I referred to 2 different receipts that I had and they are saying neither are the correct one. I told them that they should be able to check the date. After I returned the box in the Livermore, CA location on First Street, the woman helped me lower my monthly bill with a new plan going from $220+ per month to approximately $160 plus tax, I was told on July 27. They said they couldn’t see back that far and their system only goes back one year. My bill in June 2009 was for $224.09 and in July 2009, it went down to $177.74. I again asked, “Can't you look between May and July of last year?” ”No, I'm sorry but our system doesn't go back that far.” I was told again that I would need to find the receipt or I'd have to pay for the missing box. A few weeks later, I received a letter dated August 12, 2010, saying a bill would be coming if I could not produce the receipt proving I turned the box in. I called customer service again on August 26 and was told again that someone would get back to me. I asked for the same lady that I spoke to back on July 27. I was told that he couldn't see that information in the Comcast system. I was given the reference number **** and was told I would hear back from someone within 4 to 7 business days. On my 9/2/10 bill, I was charged $310 for this box that still to date, 10/19/10, no one has gotten back to me since the 8/26 call. How am I expected to prove that the receipts I have are not correct when those are what was given to me? I didn't notice at first that I was still being charged because my bill dramatically decreased soon after I returned the box. Comcast doesn't appear to be able to help or is unwilling because their systems aren't capable of looking back more than 12 months? If they cannot look back this far, maybe that's why you cannot see the box? Now, I'm being charged for a box I do not have nor used and on top of everything, being charged for the usage of it. All the while, I've been telling Comcast I don't have the box."
1,I had submitted a complaint back on 10/19/10 and have not heard back anything from neither Consumer Affairs nor Comcast. What do I do from here?
1,"Since having Comcast services for the past 2 1/2 years, my husband and I have only experienced problems. None of our bills or services are consistent from month to month. The last incident occurred in October 2010. Our bill increased by $30. We were informed that this amount would last for six months and Comcast was offering no deals. Our last bill that was received in November increased by $70. I called Comcast on November 26, 2010 and was informed that on the previous call, we had requested additional services. We spoke with four representatives and there were no changes in our services. I asked for representatives' last names, which they would not give and I also asked for a letter to be sent in the mail of proof of our conversation, which they also refused. On this last call, I was told that all additional charges for new services would be removed but they could not guarantee the amount that was discussed in October. The representative also said that I would receive a call from a representative to discuss these charges within 24 hours. I still have not heard from anyone and our bill still has not been changed. I expect our bill to decrease to what we were guaranteed in October and also want it extended more than six months. Why does Comcast expect their customers to call every six months to discuss new plans, when they are not even willing to offer new plans?"
1,"I do not watch TV. I haven't had cable television in years. I do not want cable, however I do use Internet. Comcast Cable actually penalizes their customers for not having cable TV. I pay their monthly fee for their Internet and over and beyond that I pay almost $15 dollars per month in order not to have cable television. This is a ridiculous requirement. I should not have to pay to not have service."
1,"About three months ago, I called Comcast customer service to change my bundle package for one that I search on the internet which is for 12 months. Customer agent offered me a free promotion of three months of show time, Cinemax and sport package free and a Latino package free for six months. Today, I called Comcast customer agent to remove the first free promotion of showtime, Cinemax and sport package. The customer agent said to me that my package will expire by next month and that the price was going to be higher. I said to her how could that be if I just picked a new package the same day the free promotions were offered to me. I asked her that I wanted to speak with a supervisor and she denied it to me and also argued with me that the same thing she was telling me it was the same thing that the supervisor was going to tell me. I asked about three times that I wanted to speak with a supervisor or someone higher than her and she would not let me to speak to anybody else but her. It is ridiculous how these companies offer packages to the customers they don't place it in the system and then the customers end up paying more and trying to take advantage of customer to get more profit base on the economy at this time of life. "
1,Cable box keeps cutting off without warning and in the most inconvenient times.  When I called my cable provider I was informed that I had to take the box all the way across town and exchange it for another box.  I'm disabled and can no longer drive so now I have to ride a city bus to take a bad box to your organization.As soon as I get my month's worth you can come get this piece of ** box and disconnect your cable service.  You are not the only cable provider in Houston.  I  will find another one who is a little more sympathetic to my disability.
1,"Customer, beware of what this company is selling. I purchased a package deal that sounded within my budget. The technician came to my home and told me the box will have to be relocated to another part of my home. I told the first one no as I did not need anymore holes in my walls. The second tech came out and said the same thing. He replaced the unit from one location to another.The deal was no installation fees. When I got the first bill, everything was good. The second bill was Ok. The 3rd bill had installation fees, service fees and hidden charges. The deal was for $119/month. My bill came in well over that amount. My son and I tried several calls to Comcast. I was told they will remove the installation fees and that I was the one who wanted the box relocated. At that time I told the staff I was speaking to that it was their technician who stated the box had to be relocated and he needs to get his facts straight.He tried to give me some bogus information, which I assured him that the package I was given along with fees was not acceptable. My son called about the bill and was told there was a past due. We have proof that the past due bill she mentioned was paid and my son told the person on the other line that. Up till now Comcast has refused to reduce the bill in question. Although Comcast states they give quality service, several times throughout the day the service is interrupted. This company is following the lead of other companies as becoming a rip-off company. Someone needs to take a closer look. Their staff will say or do anything to make a sale. Again, customer service is lacking. Another hole in my wall. I’m over-charged."
1,"I didn't know my mother owed a bill to Comcast. So when I moved and I established cable through Comcast, they wanted me to send my lease. Well, my mother’s name is on the lease also, so they turned my service off and charged her past bill under my name. I'm just 18 years old and just establishing credit. How can they charge me for my mother’s bill? Now I'm stuck with a $1700.00 cable bill. I was going to pay my first month’s bill and they cut my service all and billed a $1700.00 bill. Please give me answers a.s.a.p. Can they do this? Is this legal?"
1,"During early summer of 2010, most of our HD channels deteriorated. I exchanged the DVR box, but the problem remained. I set up a visit by a technician in August and he determined that the cable line is broken somewhere in the Comcast controlled region. He escalated it to Comcast to be fixed and estimated it by two weeks tops. In September, I set a new appointment as the problem was not resolved. The same technician called me to explain that they are still working on it and asked me to follow up two weeks later. I did call the technician who explained that Comcast is having trouble with some component of their equipment.It is now over 3 months since the problem occurred and our HD is still not working well, including the DVR recordings. We are paying top money for service that we don't get for over 3 months now and Comcast is not doing any step to correct the problem. Comcast has monopoly in the area for cable TV and we don't have Fios to choose. I ask that we get some refund or reduction in rate ($140/month) until Comcast fixes their faulty equipment or line.The technician’s number is ** and I am not sure, but I think his name is Brian."
1,"As a daily occurence, incoming calls are routed directly to my voice mail without the telephone ringing. When I attempt to make an outgoing call, I receive the signal that there are phone messages, even though I have not been away from the telephone. Comcast has sent technicians to my home and I have had numerous interactions with their tech staff, but no resolution to the problem. Most recently, on November 16th, I was told that my account was mistakenly flagged as having limited incoming calls, and that the problem had been noted and corrected. However, the ring bypass continues. "
1,"First off, I was already a Comcast customer but moved to a new location and they charged me another service of installation fee to have my service switched to the new address.  Second, I set up automatic bill pay but for some reason, it wasn't working.  I was charged a $5 late fee for not having my payment in on time.  When I spoke to Comcast, they apologized and gave me a credit on my next bill.  They assured me that automatic bill pay was set up properly but that sometimes it takes a couple of months to work.The next month, the same thing happened.  I had to go through the same process of calling them to credit my account.  Again, they assured me it was set up properly and to just wait one more month.  The same thing happened for a third time and I quit trying to use the automatic bill pay.  They did credit my account but I had to spend time waiting on the phone and explaining the situation every time.  It was kind of frustrating but okay.  When I initially signed up service at my new home, I added cable so I asked to have the cheapest Internet service so I could balance the two out.The person on the phone told me I already had the cheapest Internet service.  After about nine months, I see my bills are getting higher (I had a six-month promotional plan) so I call to see if there is any way for me to cancel some of the services--I have to bring the cost down.  At this time, I find out she had signed me up for the 20 MB Internet service which costs almost $60 per month when I could have had the 1.5 MB service at $24 per month.The only thing I use my Internet for is to check my email so I could care less how fast it is.  When I do the math, I figure I am out a little under $300 after paying for the service for almost nine months at that rate.  I asked for a supervisor to file a complaint and the best she can do is say she's sorry.  Wonderful.  Thanks, Comcast! !"
1,Comcast is billing me a month in advance of which I haven't even used their service then they charge me 30.00 late fee. My bill comes and says 113.00. I call them and they told me I owe 143.00! They won't explain why. I am also an epileptic and I need my phone and they said they could not help me. My regular charges went up without them even telling me. My phone was turned off when I needed to call my seizure doctor to go in the hospital. I need my phone more than anything for medical reasons.
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for probably 18 years. 13 through my condo which I had no dealings with, but 5 since I purchased my home. For the most part things were fine, despite the fact periodically, they raised the prices or required new equipment without letting me know. On several occasions, I considered switching but figured the energy in switching wasn't worth the increases.On 8/24/10, I contacted Comcast to see about having my bill reduced and possibly add DVR service. My friend contacted them and had her bill reduced by about 20% but of course they never do that without you asking for it. Increases are automatic, decreases you have to 'beg' for. In any event I thought it was worth a try, but also thought it was time to get on the DVR wagon. I entered into a Chat session with an associate and we discussed the options. Of course, they were very polite. Little did I know, I was entering a state of 'false sense of security.' I figured I had our transaction in writing, so if anything went wrong I had 'proof.' Additionally, it allowed me to do other things. Now, despite the fact this took an hour and a half (which is too long in my opinion for a consumer or for a company), I went away with a secure feeling that all was set. I triple verified the prices and asked all questions under the sun. Now the nightmare begins. For the last two and a half months I have nothing but headaches. Firstly, they never showed up for the appointment that I took 1/2 a day off work for. When I contacted them, they didn't have it in the system, despite the fact they had the upgrade but no appointment? We rescheduled, got a credit for the appointment. Then they didn't show up for the 2nd appointment. When I called to find out what was going on, the hold message stated, you have an appointment for the 11th (it was the 4th and it was supposed to be at 11 am) The woman who came on said, ""Yes, I see notes for the 4th, but maybe since it has passed it kicked it to the next week.""Long story short on that, when I got the dispatch manager, she told me that person lied. I wasn't in the system! What the, she was rude, and when I called her out on that and what I have had to deal with she changed her tone.A tech showed up at my door 30 minutes later. Finally! Then the next phase of problems started, my bill was all wrong, the prices quoted where not honored and the install credit wasn't there. When I emailed to inquire, they told me they said, ""We don't see those prices, so sorry.""After a solid week of e-mailing, I got a supervisor call. He was a bit snippy with me at first and when I didn't back down, he finally listened. He too told me that he doesn't know what I am talking about those prices aren't in the system and never were. I said, as I said at least 10 times, I have it in writing. He said 'oh, well' send it to me but it doesn't mean we can honor it. I said, ""Really?"" When I inquired about it they said, it was because I kept one of the once free digital boxes when I added the DVR. I explained I didn't know that, and I put it in a spare room just because.They should have told me. Why would I pay 9.99 for DVR and 7.50 for a spare box? They said, I needed to initiate a chat and have it removed. Oh yeah and the 24.99 for 12 months never existed, so they won't honor it. So again, I started a chat session and there they told me that A. they can't honor it. When I told them I have it in writing, get me a supervisor, they said basically, ""Oh well, nothing we can do and no we can't transfer you to a supervisor."" On the 7.50 charge, they changed their story. It is now a fee to get the DVR service. Well, I am already paying for the DVR service and I was told there wasn't an equipment fee. Yeah, oh well, if you take that off you won't get service, even though I am paying 80 dollars for service, if I don't pay the 7.50, I won't get any. **? So, I decided to write the same supervisor from before and explain the situation again, with all in writing. He has chosen to not respond to me this time. No phone calls no e-mails. I so want to send this to the newspapers. It is wrong. They quote, get me to agree then change everything and honor only 80% but after I have to fight for 2 and 1/2 months. It is bait and switch and dishonorable. "
1,"Getting ready to transfer to FL from DE, I sent in our full last months invoice for service (ending 4/19/2010) along with a letter in the bill envelope stating, the cancellation of service in writing. We left for FL in early April 1st. Our home is up for sale, so we had our boy come and check on things after we had left so we could be sure everything had been looked up and tight. He called and told us the internet and phone were out, but the cable was still on. I sent another letter out to Comcast in Georgetown to advise them we had left and cancelled, to please turn off the service.In May, I received another bill, called customer service and explained the situation. The girl helping me said we needed to return 'the box'; after telling her we had not been made aware of that and that we were already in FL and had no way to get the box there but that my husband would be back up in July and would return it then. She supposedly took care of things.My husband returned the box in July and we expected no other communication. We again received more bills, now coming from collections. I have written to Comcast and to the collection agency and tried again to the problems we were having getting this resolved. Today (11/16), I received notice that they were sending a notice of report to the CB. I decided to attempt one more time to rectify the problem.After speaking with one gentleman and not getting anywhere, I then got transferred to a Suzanne/Susan who would not budge or give any credence to my appeals. I requested to speak with her supervisor, to which she replied that she would have her supervisor call within 10-15 minutes. It is an hour and a half later and still no call. She insisted that the service was used on April 3rd (when my son was there checking on the house) to which I replied. I had paid in full the last month's invoice which went to April 19th. So, in effect, we still would not have owed any more $$. What is wrong with this company? I am now researching the district call center's supervisor now, hoping to get some resolution but I am not very hopeful given the circumstances. "
1,"I signed on for an addition to my service which included BBC America. I have previously enjoyed this channel being a Brit and I had checked out online the contents of this channel. There are lots of Brit comedies, etcetera. To my horror, I got Star Wars, some Kitchen Show, Dr. Who, and nothing else. I did not get what I signed up for! I am so disgusted with Comcast. By tomorrow, I will have this extra service removed. What are you playing at? I have just been paying for crap."
1,"My husband and I moved into our new (just built) house in February.  The first Monday after we moved in, we had a tech from Comcast come to set us up with cable, internet and phone.  We are on a main road but our section didn't have a lot of houses up, so Comcast didn't have any lines to tap into to hook us up. The technician couldn't tell us anything.  After calls to Comcast, we were told that this problem would be fixed between six and eight weeks!  ""But don't worry it never takes that long.""  We didn't have any of these services for almost four months.  My husband called every week and would always be transferred numerous times repeating the situation to either get no help, a ""we cannot disclose when the third-party will be there to set up lines, etc.""  He finally reached someone who seemed to know what she was talking about and asked if he could have her direct line and she said she didn't have one.  So continue with the hundreds of transfers, repeating the situation over and over again.  You would think that they would document things so this wouldn't happen.On Demand goes out on our TV every week, you call the number on the screen-always the same answer, you have to unplug your cable box, re-plug then wait a half hour. You would think it would be fixed so it didn't go out.  They gave us HBO for three months as a ""sorry"" but then automatically charged us for the premium channel once the three months were up, instead of notifying us. Last night, November 9th 2010, my husband went on the internet at 6 was fine.  I went on at 8:30 and our internet and phone service wasn't working.  It said that we had a strong connection but no access was available.  My husband called Comcast and talked to some kid from Novia Scotia who had no idea what was going on.  He asked how the two services were lost but not cable and the response was, ""well, I think the phone and internet is connected somehow.""  I hate Comcast and laugh at their customer service commercials but it is the only option we had in our area! "
1,"I was given an $80 price of Triple Play HD for one year at Best Buy and was told that it would be the same at Comcast in Memphis. It ended up twice the amount on the first bill. I have a few days left in the $30 money back thing and will cancel unless I get prices in writing. There is something badly wrong with fraud in the Comcast company. Someone needs to file for class action suit against Comcast, and very soon to teach them a business lesson on fraud against the American public."
1,"I have received the absolute worst service from Comcast Cable company, from placing the order to the actual installation. The first call I made to add the Comcast service, the service rep quoted me $25 installation fee and 15 dollars for each additional box. I hung up and called back in. The next rep quoted $25 installation fee and no charge for the additional boxes. I ordered 1 hi-def and 3 regular boxes. The technician came to do the installation Monday, November 8th; he is a contractor for Comcast.He had his ladder up on the pole and was ready to place a new drop from the pole to the house. I asked him, what's wrong with the existing buried drop? Apparently nothing because he didn't know it was buried. He spent another 1/2 standing at the gate, trying to figure out how to run the wire to the family room, and then he told me I should probably stay with DirecTV, as the wire he was about to run would be unsightly.I knew when he asked me where my crawl space was, that I was in trouble. We're on a slab floor. He didn't have to run wire, I pointed out that the wire was all brand new in the attic. The additional television boxes I received were not ""real"" cable boxes, apparently you can't watch HBO or the additional channels you upgrade to, with these new boxes, you can only watch those channels on the main TV. Why wasn't that explained to me? Why did three Comcast reps all quote different prices?I refused to sign the work order; he said he didn't have the other boxes that you watch all the stations on in his truck. He left his manager's number and said to call him after I spoke with Comcast. When the technician left, I didn't realize that none of the televisions worked; I could only view one channel. The receivers the technician installed never ""downloaded the channels"". I called back in for customer support and was told it wouldn't be until Friday, that they could send someone back out. Are you kidding me? I can't watch TV on any of the channels. What terrible service! "
1,"The person that I talked to that day had told me that they will turn it off immediately. I called them again on 10/07/10 to find the service still on. They told me again that they will turn it off immediately. After getting a bill stating that I owe them $78.01 as of 10/19/10, I called them regarding the bill and found that they did not turn it off until 10/19/10. Comcast is trying to make me pay for the sheer ignorance and stupidity that they have shown. I am barely outside of homelessness, is there any way they can be held responsible for virtually helping bad people continue cable service with my name on it?"
1,"We are retired community Chanteclair Villages and we have a contract with Comcast for the whole community. When we have problems, there is no way they answer their phones, call us back or give us adequate service."
1,"I signed onto my Comcast account and had an offer that clearly says ""for existing customers"" and had a rate. I went through the ordering process which at the end connects to an online employee who completes the order. She told me that offer was only for new customers and told me I could do another offer and sign a 2 year contract (that was more). I sent her a link to the screen with the offer I had and she told me again that was not available to me. I have a print screen of the offer, that was false advertising! "
1,"I had the worst experience of my life with these people as I waited 11 hours for them to show up at my house to install new service, as they never gave me the respect of a phone call to say they were not coming after several promises to be here. I called them 14 times this day, frustrated but dealing quite patiently with the situation as I really had no choice as they do have the monopoly.I had to miss now only a half a day of work, but after several promises of they're arrival, I had to take the whole day off only to have them never show up, never give me a phone call and at the end of the day, eleven hours later, ""Frank"" offers to reschedule for ""4 days later is the next available opening"". He refused to give me an address of Corporate and refused to put me through to a supervisor. The next day, while I was at work I received a phone call from a young man stating that he was in my driveway and where was I? No one told me they were coming. I believe there is a huge problem with the dispatching department and communication with the clients.I missed a days work, experienced much stress, heightened blood pressure. My days work was equal to $500 to $700. "

1,"Comcast is extremely unreliable and unstable. I work from home so my work got me a Comcast business class cable connection. It is supposed to be fast and reliable, right? Wrong. First, it's slower than my consumer cable connection (also from Comcast, yeah, my mistake). On a good day, the business line is only maybe about half of the speed (according to speedtest.net)of the consumer line. Okay, so I don't have the fastest speed. No problem. At least make sure it's stable so I can do business, after all it is supposed to be ""business class"". I've had the connection for almost 3 months and in that time, I have experienced numerous service interruptions. Just last week, the connection went out for a whole day. I called Comcast 3 times and was told they experienced unscheduled service interruption in the area. I asked them when it can be restored? They said, ""Don't know"". I replied, “Will someone come to look into it?”,and the rep said, “They are working on it, sir”.The connection went out again yesterday at 9am. I called customer service and they had no idea what the problem was. They instructed me to restart then reset the modem. Twenty minutes later, the connection came back, everyone's happy, but not for long. This morning connection promptly went out at 9am again, and this time, it stayed out. I called Customer Service and they went through the same routine. Since this time, the connection didn't come back by itself, they told me a tech would come out in 4 hours to solve the problem. Four hours came and went, the tech never called or showed. I called back Comcast and was told they now found out it's another area-wide signal issue"" And since they are fixing the problem, they didn't send a tech out.No phone call to let their customer know the tech is not coming either. Another 3-4 hrs later, the connection is finally restored, after the business hours had long ended. Well, silly me, I tried to log on and catch up on some work tonight. Guess what, the connection is gone again. I called Comcast and they blamed it squarely on the modem. It's connected 1 min and disconnect the next. I asked, “Are you sure you guys don't have another signal issue in the area again? Because that's the same thing they had told me this morning until they found out the real problem"", the rep said, ""Nope. No issue with the signal”.Well they promised another tech will show up tomorrow morning, but will he/she? That's anyone's guess. I had to borrow my wife's laptop and wireless card to write this complaint. My question is this - When business cannot operate because Comcast ""business class connection"" is unstable and unreliable, what responsibility does Comcast have? I for one was unable to do any work during the numerous and lengthy service interruptions, and I believe many more people are affected the same way. When I asked Comcast customer service this question, they told me, ""Well sir, Comcast is already compensating you."" I asked, ""How?!""m and the reply was, ""By having our technicians repairing the problem"".But isn't it what Comcast supposed to do in the first place? Shouldn't Comcast be held responsible for its Business Class Internet Connection's failure, when it cause loss of business and work to people who had paid and subscribed them? Maybe a class action law suit is what's needed. Thanks for reading through my long post. If you have problems with Comcast Business Class Internet, let's hear it."
1,"Okay, let's begin! Back in January 2010, I moved here to East Orange, NJ! I originally wanted DirecTV (I love satellite), but found out that this building only allowed Sheisty cable to be installed because DirecTV only wanted their service and not cable to have any input here, thus making Comcast the contract winner. Not that I'm downing Comcast's service because I haven't had terrible service. Anyway, there was an offer that if I signed up for their triple play contract that I would receive a $200 gift card! Okay. Since I work for a cable company, I know how this goes. So I thought to myself, ""Hmmm. Great. I'll do it."" So I signed up. The terms clearly stipulated that this was a 24 month contract and that starting with month 13, my price would increase by I believe $20. I would need to fulfill the requirement to pay my bill on time every month for three months, 90days. I have done that!To skip all the in-between because I know that some of you fools like myself already have been through this, it is now November 2010 and I still do not have a gift card. I have escalated this to a corporate complaints level and I still do not have a gift card! I believe Comcast has breached their contract in falsely getting me to sign up for their service without ever making good on their offer. That is fraud! Because this is a contract, I am not able to change my level of service without incurring a fee! I would like from Comcast an inconvenience credit equal to one month's service credit. They have offered to credit my account, the $200. That was not listed as part of the terms of the contract when I signed up, that if they don't send a gift card, they will credit my account. Thus, they are trying to make it easier on themselves to just wash this under the rug and act like it never happened, by making such an offer. Do I have a leg to stand on? Or I ***? The woman from the corporate escalation group says that she has looked into it and she is being told that I will have to wait another 30 days. That is **** near an entire year that I will have waited. This other guy named Rick from corporate left me a voice mail message a few weeks ago and told me that the card should be in my mailbox by October 20th. That was a lie! I asked Debbie from the corporate escalations team to give me a month's credit for the inconvenience, due to what I feel is a breach of contract. She told me let's wait until we get the gift card to you. And then they can review if my request has any merit. I think she is lying because they have no intentions of issuing a gift card! What do I do?"
1,"All Comcast customers know the new digital adapters are now required to get the same service we got prior to October 2010. My complaint is that they are adding a shipping charge of $9.95 for this hardware when in fact Comcast said there is no shipping. Comcast will give you a credit if you call and wade through numerous voice menus before you can talk to a CSR. This is an obvious attempt to steal illegal revenue from customers, hoping the customer won't notice the charge on their bill."
1,"A complete bungling; bottom line, I wasted valuable time off from work to be here for the installation. The guy showed up on time, not his fault, but the operator who took my order completely lied to me about the services they were providing. The installer did not have the order correct, and they wanted to add three DVRs at a cost of $45 per month over what they told me my fees would be. I told them to go away. I'd rather stay with Dish, who I am already unhappy with, better to stay with the devil I know. Thus, after calling four to five times and getting different pricing depending upon the operator I got, I should have known the outcome would not be good. I do not recommend Comcast for any reason."
1,"I called Comcast last week after I realized I made 2 payments to PSEG by mistake. I informed them of my accounting error and told them I would set up a payment for next week on Friday 11/5 for $160,just 3 days past the final past due date of 11/2. I offered the confirmation # for my bank payment and the rep advised me that it was not necessary, my account is good and she would document my payment arrangement. I specifically asked, since I am going, I past the due date would my service be disconnected and she checked my account and assured me that there would not be any interruption in my service since I only owed the 1 month. I asked this because previously they disconnected my service last year because my payment was short by $3.82! Today, my daughter gets home from school and there is no phone service (thank goodness for cell phones since she was home alone), no computer service (so she can't complete her homework) and no TV no big deal. She calls me at work to let me know what happened so I called Comcast. The rep confirmed that she saw my payment arrangement in the system notes but she would have to transfer me to collections because my service was disconnected. Eric, employee 9OX, answered and proceeded to tell me that I did not make payment arrangements even though he saw the same notes the previous rep read. Because I did not make arrangements with collections, they did not honor it even though my account was not in collections when I called last week. He began reading his script about their policy.I told him I called last week so this would not happen and he basically told me that the rep I spoke to just documented my account and it held no weight. Confused about what is considered a payment arrangement vs. just documentation, I asked for a supervisor. He continued to talk no matter how many times I asked to speak to a supervisor until finally I asked him to stop talking and give me what I asked for and not to take this personally. He then gives me a ticket # and transfers me to a supervisor. Ryan 9AH picks up. I go through the same thing with him and after talking to him for a few minutes asking again when a payment arrangement could be made and honored, he could not answer the questions. Why? He is not a supervisor in the Collections Dept! He is in customer service the original contact I had when I called in who told me they could not help me because my account was in collections. He had no authority to do anything to restore my service since my account was in collections because he was not in that department.I asked if this was some type of run around game and he proceeded to tell me that he was the only Supervisor available. He then said he never disclosed that up front because I just asked for a Supervisor, I didn't ask for a Collections Supervisor. Furious at this point, I asked for a Collections Supervisor and was told he could not do that but I could speak to his boss who of course could not come to the phone so I have to wait for a call back.Here's what I found out so far. When I called in last week, my account was not in collections so my call was routed to the active customer service rep who does not work for Comcast. Since the call was rerouted, so they could not pull the conversation between us proving that I did make arrangements and was never told any info that I found out today because those calls are not recorded. When I called back today I was told by Ryan that;3. ) Comcast will not honor an extension because my previous call was not considered a payment arrangement. Ryan informed me that he could only ask his supervisor to call me, not a collections supervisor so still, no help or answers. I ended up paying the account current so my daughter could do her homework. I could have lived without TV for 3 days.I still have not gotten an answer on when or how you can make a payment arrangement with Comcast if I ever run into a problem in the future. My guess is that there is none, so don't waste your time giving them a courtesy call to tell them you are going to be late. It doesn't matter. By the way, I only owed them for 1 month, $153.44. My next payment is due at the end of November for $154.00."
1,"On Oct. 23, 2010, Comcast suspended my service for no apparent reason. I called in that day and the next, no one was able to give me a reason of what happened. So finally on Sunday, Oct. 24, 2010, I was set up for a tech to come out and access the problem. The tech came out on Tuesday, Oct 26, 2010. I then learned that others who were stealing the service caused people like myself to become disconnected so that we had to call in and be reconnected. This type of behavior by a company is out out of control. This is the 21st century, with all types of technological advantages. I am outraged that this is happening. This company needs to enforce the laws that protect them and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. When law abiding people do what is right and pay their bill service, they should not be suspended for the lawlessness of others. "
1,"On and about 9/16/10, I called Comcast because my DVR cable box wasn't working and spoke with one of the reps. He told me that he was going to troubleshoot my box and he did. Then he told me to put my television on channel 3 and I did. Then on 9/17/10, I received a letter saying that I had to give them a deposit. I called Comcast on 9/17/10 and spoke with one of the reps. I asked why did they run my credit without my permission nor did the rep say he was running my credit. I asked to speak with a manager and was told there wasn't any managers around, so I said have one of the managers to call me ASAP.When one of the supervisor (Omaar) called me, I told him what had happened and he said he would get back to me on the following Tuesday. He did but without an answer. I called Comcast back again on 10/4/10 and spoke with Ann at 2:38PM. I told her the same story and asked for a supervisor. She got the same results (no supervisor was available) but she did say she spoke with her supervisor (Mr. **). He said he was going to remove the deposit and never done anything. I told them at Comcast that it is illegal to run someone's credit and don't tell them anything about running it or getting their permission. I had to keep calling Comcast about this problem and I was always told they were going to remove it but they never did until I called back on 10/13/10 at 12:36PM and spoke with Timothy. He said he was putting in the paperwork to have this deposit removed from my bill. I have been with Comcast since 2007 and never had to give a deposit. I refused to give one now."
1,"I should have sensed trouble in the fact that the installing technician was in such a hurry to get the job done that he could hardly give me the time to explain what he had done. Since that day, I have had trouble with my internet. Access has been barred to many sites and a Comcast message comes up ""Oops! Activation incomplete.""I have called three times. Nothing compared to some of your contributors and the last call to a ""supervisor"" (I wonder) I was assured that the problem would be fixed within 48 hours at the most and probably less. Well, no surprise, four days later nothing has been ""fixed."" My frustration is only beginning, I guess, but one does wonder about the financial impact on the company to have to keep coming back for ""fixes"" instead of getting the job done right to begin with. I would think it would be more cost efficient to do quality work in the first place, even if it cost a bit more to hire better qualified technicians than to string the work out over several weeks, months, years? I'm sure the costs incurred is being passed on to the customer(s) so maybe they do it on purpose. Is this fraudulent?"
1,"I am very disgusted with the sound problem when watching videos. I get the volume set then when video is over, the commercial just blasts. I hurry to turn it down and have to turn up again when the next video comes on. When finished, the volume blasts again. The same thing happens over and over. What can be done? My speakers are not the problem. Any help would be appreciated."
1,"On 4/2/10, I arrived home from work at approximately 5:00 pm. Upon entering my residence, I discovered that our Comcast equipment from our main living area had been disconnected and was missing. I spoke with my 12-year-old stepson who had been at the residence all day alone and he had indicated that ""a man came in the house and took all of our stuff"". Upon further investigation, I discovered that 4 other Comcast cable units that were located in our bedrooms and living corridors had also been disconnected and taken. My stepson stated that the man rang the doorbell and told him that he had to ""get equipment that belonged to Comcast"". He then entered into our home and removed said items from our bedrooms in the 2nd level of our home. This representative then left a Comcast slip called a ""field collection receipt"" on our table. The collection receipt included our address, a list of serial numbers, his representative ID number, and the former tenants last name. He removed the equipment believing that the former tenants still resided at this address without clarifying who did live here. Comcast gave us a new reconnect date and time and did not show up. I took time off from work and they were a no show. It took us a number of calls, return calls, and our personal time to get Comcast to make this right. Comcast then falsified the notes in their computer system to make it look like the representative did indeed remove the former tenants rented equipment and ours in the process, however, this home was vacant when we moved in and there was no equipment left behind. Our landlord can attest to that. Comcast has not been honest in this situation and a Comcast representative illegally entered into our home with a 12-year juvenile present and removed property that they did not have consent to remove. Comcast should never allow an adult to enter a home where a parent or legal guardian is not present. A child who cannot defend themselves should not be held responsible for allowing an adult to enter into a residence and into our private corridors because he is under the assumption that he is doing his job. This child's privacy and our home was invaded upon and trespassed against without a justifiable reason. All because he did not ask who lived at this residence yet just took it upon himself/or his orders to walk right in on a defenseless child."
1,"It looks like Comcast has decided to use the switch to digital to its advantage. This wasn't evident to me at first but on October 26, 2010, I discovered that my current level of service was no longer being offered. I had to either accept fewer channels or increase my bill by $40 per month and gain quite a few channels. Our household has had limited basic cable for 15 years. The price has increased from around $12 per month to $19.95 in that time period. We even moved once with no noticeable change to our plan. Now Comcast is telling me that I'm getting channels I shouldn't, and that I must accept fewer channels for the same amount or pay $60 per month (but they do have a 6-month special). This is because with the switch to digital, the limited basic package was reduced and for the last year or so I've been getting channels I shouldn't.From what I can gather, Comcast does not want limited basic cable customers. This reduction in service is an attempt to purge this level of service. I've been told that you can't call up and receive limited basic cable - only those who've had it are allowed to keep it. Once you're out you can't get it any more. It seems convenient for Comcast to blame this on the switch to digital.By the way, I'm not even sure Comcast has their story straight. The first rep I talked with said I could go pick up the technology I need from a Customer Service center (no mention of fees or charges). The second one I spoke with said that I must choose a $60 plan if I wanted more than channels 2-28 with my cable. "
1,"The reason that I’m filing this complaint is that I had cable for 4 months through Comcast. When they cut the cable due to nonpayment, they tried to charge me for an additional two months. So I called them and they took the charge off, but they informed me that I would have to pay a month in advance to have my cable turned back on along with the outstanding bill."
1,"After being lied to over the last 1.5+ years, I finally chose to terminate Comcast cable TV and today, October 26. 2010, was the date for action. I first called to be sure that I could terminate my television portion and second, to be sure of cost and availability of internet and telephone service. Once it was confirmed that service was available, I proceded to enter a contract for satellite dish service starting tomorrow. I then spent additional time by visiting my local Comcast service center in Freeport, IL, to make sure what equipment need to be returned, etc. This is where the problem started. They would not allow me to contract for partial service, phone and internet.They told me that the only way I could do this was to wait 30 or more days without any services! They tried to tell me that I would lose the telephone number that I have had for over 25 years if I terminated service, I advised them I did not believe they could keep my phone number not allowing me to switch it. I also let them know that I did not think that trying to ""hold me hostage"" with these threats was very becoming of them.I then spent over 107 minutes on the phone with Comcast trying to terminate or trim services from the $201+ per month contract that they pushed me into in July 2009 if I remember correctly. After all, it has been many months and many lies since communications began last year. I could go on and on about how Comcast treated me and I have been a customer with them for close to 10 years in Illinois and for far longer at a second residence in Florida. "
1,"I have been always charged and overcharged all the time. I have been sexually harassed by the tech. Also, he broke a $400.00 vase, when he tried to hide. He was on the phone continuous while at my home and flirted with the women, who also worked at Comcast, who seemed to enjoy the way he spoke to them in a disrespected manner. I tried to get a supervisor or manager who will understand and listen this ****.I'm very, very stressed and upset about this. Many times I was told I was gonna be given a credit and the next person acts totally clueless. But the sexual harassment is it for me. I feel very violated and when they act like it's nothing. Now, I'm gonna look further into it because this is no way to handle a case as this one."
1,"I've had Comcast for about 10.5 months now. Every 2 months, Comcast comes and cut my cable off.  See, I live in an apartment building, so every couple of months, Comcast comes and cut the lines of people whose account isn't up to date.  My payment is never late, so why do my lines get cut every time they come out to my apartment building?Well, a week ago they cut my lines again. I have phone, cable, and internet services through them.  They claim a technician came out 4 times. Since then I've only seen 1.  He claims he couldn't find my line. The other 2 times, they said the technician claims I was not home.  I'm home all day. I have an infant.  I'm currently enrolled in an online school, but due to no internet service, I cannot receive or submit work.  I do not have a car, and the library is pretty far from my apartment.  I have no TV service at all, due to the digital transmission switch, plus I can't contact anyone, since I have no phone service,  and the last time they came the technician said that i was not home, but at the time I was on my friend's cell phone with the Comcast customer service person.I was at home at the time, so she said she was sending him back out in an hour.  I got a call saying that the technician was outside, I looked and I didn't see a technician outside.  In 3 minutes, I got a call back from the Comcast customer service rep, saying that the technician said that the office to my apartment building was closed, and he wasn't allowed access.  The office was closed the day they cut my cable lines.  The office don't need to be open.  They are repairing my cable, not the office's.  I get excuses after excuses.  It's frustrating for me and my 3 kids.  They said they will return tomorrow.  I'll see how things will go.Because of them, I am failing online school, I am always bored, short tempered, and it is costing me money to buy DVDs."
1,"For over a year I have been asking Comcast to remove a monthly charge for the Howard Stern show from my bill.  I never ordered this show, don't watch it, and don't know how I keep getting charged for it.  Every time I speak to someone at Comcast, I'm told the charge will be removed from my bill and will not show up again.  Then the next month I receive my bill, with a credit for the overcharge, there’s a new charge for Howard Stern.  This is unbelievable.  Some months I just can't even deal with speaking to them and wasting another hour on the phone.  I call the following month and I get apologies, promises that it will be fixed, etc., and then the same thing happens.  I get a credit for the erroneous charge and they turn right around and charge me again! Also, several months ago, I suddenly was not able to get channels I have always had (and am being charged for) so I called Comcast.  They sent a ""bump"" through but couldn't fix the problem.  They said something was wrong with my DVR box.  Rather than sending a tech out to fix or replace, they said they would ship me a new DVR along with a prepaid label to return the defective box.  I got the new DVR (and lost all the programs I had recorded).  I sent the defective DVR back in the box they had provided, attaching the prepaid UPS label and dropped it off at Mail Boxes, etc.  That was months ago and Comcast is still charging me for the defective box that I returned. When I call, I'm told they can't find the box I returned.  They ask me if I have shipping info.  When I tell them it was returned using a label, they sent me they seem stumped.  They promise to track it and call me back, but I have never heard from them.  Comcast is one of the worst companies I have ever had the misfortune to deal with.  I wish there were another choice of providers in my area but there isn't.  Believe me; I would switch in an instant if there were.  Don't deal with Comcast if you have any choice."
1,Was told my problem was with my 4-year old Magnavox TV. Power button would not come on with or without remote. Was told I needed to contact a repairman. I never had this problem until Comcast install new digital box. They did not install it properly or refer to Magnavox owners manual to reset TV settings after digital installation. 
1,"I have been a customer of Comcast for years.  I live in four apartment complex.  I have had trouble with my cable service constantly.  They have come here at least 8 times within the last 7 months.  They fix the problem each time and then something else happens to it.  My neighbors have no problem with their cable.  I try to tell these repair people that it has been a major problem with the service in my apartment.  Their remedy is to credit my account for the inconvenience.  I want the service that I pay for.I came home from work yesterday and it’s not working.  They sent a refresh to the boxes and told me to wait twenty minutes.  After thirty minutes, I still had no service.  In my computer room I have a TV that doesn't have a box and the cable wire goes directly to the TV.  Guess what, it works.  I told Comcast about this.  They can't get anybody out here until Sunday between 11 am and 2 pm.  I pay my bill on time.  I should get the service.  In the last 30 days, this is the third time I had to call them and be without service.  I am going to write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper about this matter.  Maybe after Comcast sees this letter, they will realize I and other customers are tired of the inconvenience we have been put through."
1,Ordered a Comcast bundle. After they quoted and approved me and hooked it all up. They charged me with someone else's bill for 1397.40 on top of my bill for 367.68. Then Comcast disconnected it. They did not even notified me that they added someone else's account for 2008 to mine. I have contacted several people in their offices and been told to bring in a death certificate for this other person or the Comcast property they had. How am I suppose to do that? 
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for three years. But after discovering Comcast cable wire crossing my front yard without my permission in order to connect to the neighbors home, creating a mess in front of my yard, I canceled the service for their poor customer service and trespassing my private property. I've tried talking to Comcast for what they've done, and last result, they basically don't care! "
1,"I currently reside at The Landing @ Fancher Creek. I was informed by the leasing office that if I did not want cable service through Comcast that Comcast will still bill me by mail for their service even if it is shut off. Is this legal? I currently am receiving three months of free cable TV but pay $65.00 for high speed broadband internet (which is a joke). No other cable TV service can install their service such as AT&T U-verse which I prefer. I can have Satellite dish service from my patio, however, I was informed that Comcast will continue to bill me $37.00 per month even though I will not be using their service. I intend to switch to DirecTV and add on their Blue Sky satellite internet service. Is this legal for Comcast to start billing me for their wall outlet as they own the cable wiring in the entire complex of approximately 400 apartment units even though it will be turned off after the 3 months of free cable TV only expires?"
1,"I scheduled a technician to come out and install two high definition DVR's and progrm them so I could get my cable service upgraded to the new requirements of Comcast.  The technician came out and hooked up the two DVR's and ""programmed"" them.  I had to call customer service three times after his visit to have the DVR's reprogrammed because the on screen TV Guide would not work.Approximately one week later, I had a technician come out to replace a burnt out Internet modem and while there, he checked out the DVR's and found that they had not been programmed correctly.  The ""On Demand"" option was also not working.  I also discovered that the first technician did not hook up the epuipemnt properly.  I had replaced four VCR's and an old cable converter box with the two DVR's.  He had not removed any of the extra cabling, but had just used one of the five cables and associated hardware to hook up the DVR's.I then had to undo all of the cables, properly wire up the DVR's and remove the extra cable items.  I contacted the cable company and was told to contact my local office as this was not their problem.  The local office has no phone number access, and I am not able, at this time, to physically go in to file a complaint.  I was charged $51.99 for services rendered in an unsatisfactory manner and would like to be reimbursed."
1,"I have been a Cable customer with Comcast at my present address since June 2000. I have never had internet service through them; I have used AT&T DSL since June 2000. Due to many problems with my cable boxes I discontinued service with Comcast in June 2010, in doing so I received a paper statement the first in at least 3 years, on the statement I see that I have been charged for internet services of $45.50 per month, I have had auto pay with them since I began service.I called them in June after a technician picked up some of the boxes to confirm how to stop the auto pay. I told them that I had never had Comcast internet and she went back and saw that I didn't have one of their modems or record of a technician coming to install the service. She gave me a hard time stating that I should have looked at my bill, I told her that was none of her business but taking money from someone’s account without authorization for the services is illegal.She explained her supervisor was on vacation for the next week but she would have her contact me as soon as she returned. I never got a return call. I have called back several times having to explain the same story over and over. Today I gave it one more try over the phone, the man I spoke with said that he could only see back 12 months and put me on hold several times. And then the last time he said that it was going to take some time to get this explained to his supervisor and promised he would return my call by 8PM it is now 10:46Pm. I plan to go to the Comcast office near here and get copies of every bill ever sent to me and figure out how long I have paid for internet service that I have never had."
1,"Back on April 13, 2010, I spoke to Michael in customer service regarding my Comcast cable bill. I noticed that it appeared I was paying for three cable boxes when in reality I only had two on hand.  I was told that yes, I was being charged for three. When I told him that I returned our third box months ago, he said it didn't show anything in their system. He would put a ticket in and someone would get back to me within 24 to 48 hours.On July 27, they finally returned my call and said they couldn't find the box, that I would have to find the receipt. I referred to two different receipts that I had and they are saying neither is the correct one. I told them that they should be able to check the date. After I returned the box in the Livermore, CA location on First Street, the woman helped me lower my monthly bill with a new plan going from $220+ / month to approximately $160 + tax.  I was told on July 27 that they couldn't see back that far, that their system only goes back one year. My bill in June 2009 was for $224.09 and in July 2009, it went down to $177.74. I again asked, ""Can't you look between May and July of last year?"" ""No, I'm sorry, our system doesn't go back that far.  I was told again I would need to find the receipt or I'd have to pay for the missing box.A few weeks later I received a letter dated August 12, 2010, saying a bill would be coming if I could not produce the receipt proving I turned the box in.  I called customer service again on 8/26 and was told again that someone would get back to me.  I asked for the same lady that I spoke to back on 7/27, but was told he couldn't see that information in the Comcast system. I was given the reference no. ** and was told I would hear back from someone within 4-7 business days. On my 9/2/10 bill, I was charged $310 for this box that still to date (10/19/10), no one has gotten back to me since the 8/26 call.How am I expected to prove that the receipts I have are not correct when those are what were given to me? I didn't notice at first that I was still being charged because my bill dramatically decreased soon after I returned the box. Comcast doesn't appear to be able to help, or is unwilling because their systems aren't capable of looking back more than 12 months. If they cannot look back this far, maybe that's why you cannot see the box? Now I'm being charged for a box I do not have, nor used, and on top of everything being charged for the usage of it, all the while I've been telling Comcast I don't have the box.  Can someone please get back to me so we can resolve this issue?"
1,"I called to find out about the equipment that was removed from my new residence by the tech and was never turned in--$800.00 was owed on my bill.  When I called, I spoke to Amy first who was very rude and I asked to speak to a supervisor.  When Velmarie got on the phone, she didn't even ask if she could help me.  She picked up the phone and told me that she had no intention on speaking with me about the account because it was in my son's name.  It's very funny that I've been dealing with a long list of problems I have encountered since I moved the end of September and everyone else was very helpful.  Due to this experience, I am going elsewhere for my services.  We have been with Comcast for years and don't feel we deserve to be treated like this."
1,"Several weeks ago, I ordered ComCast Cable for TV and internet. The installer did not have all of the cables and wire to finish the job. He told me that I would have to go and buy the ones they needed. The installer also ran the cable across the floor where you walk, and I tripped over the cable after that. I called ComCast to cancel my service because of the bad installation. I had the cable for less than a week before I canceled. I turned in all of the parts that they furnished and got a receipt for that. Since then I have been getting bills for $425.00, saying I owe that. I told Comcast that the work I did to finish the installer's job and the parts I bought, they owed me $425.00. ""When you pay me, I will pay you"". I still get bills from ComCast. When I tripped on that cable running across the floor, I had a hard time getting back up. I am 68 years old and I have heart problems. I have a defibulator implant also. The stress of the problem is making my health worse."
1,"Comcast has overbilled me on numerous occasions.  I had TV through hub housing and my internet and phone through Qwest.  Comcast came knocking at my door and gave me a better price.  Then they began to add extra services like HBO with the related fees.  They would send me an outlandish bill and disconnect me when I tried to pay the correct figure.I have been their customer for two years and they sent me a $250 bill when the correct amount was $80 for two months.  They disconnected me and then started a new account for some reason.  They refused to send me any copies of my bills.  I am going to contact the attorney general in Colorado and see what can be done about this slipshod crooked company.TV ads louder you say?  I guess so.  No one can make a TV modulator like you can easily find on any audio program on your computer, even free audio programs.  Comcast has the monopoly here.  I think that they and Qwest are the same company myself.  You thought AOL had terrible customer service did you?  Not even close.  Their technicians have no knowledge what so ever and don't speak even the same language.  What i will end up doing is going with a front range broadband company.  When you call them, they actually answer the phone.  No Hi, I'm Shaquiel **  and Hi, im whoever.  Who gives a rats behind? And then did you know?I would love to strangle whoever has that voice.  I knew it the last one hundred times I was told!  Why is not the federal government looking into Comcast.  Is someone getting a big paycheck from them, I think.  Where are you FCC?  Aren't I entitled to TV equipment to receive local channels when I am disabled? Shame on you, Comcast.I got no TV and no internet.  Bill was way wrong.  There was no local office.  Next town.  Stupid ass company.  I hope you burn Comcast.  Along with Qwest and MCI."
1,"I have a business account, which is a two year contract. They claim you. If you move, it needs to be another contract with them during the two year period. Another two-year contract with the new address. During the first contract, I was told that I would get the channels 2-99 for the $99 package. Fine. One year later, I had to move to another location and the landlord took over the building for his business.Found another location. I had to sign another contract for 2 years with the same deal. Now after one year, they decide to upgrade their system telling me that in order to keep the channels that I have, I will have to pay an additional $45.I called to inquire why they had taken channels off of my package. This is when I was informed that the additional $45 would be needed to put the channels back on or pay them 75% of what is left on my contract to leave them.They could not explain why they changed things in the middle of my contract. All I could get is basic, which is only the first 20 channels. What I had gotten was extra and they made a mistake and did not charge me for the extra channels for the last 2 years. My understanding was that basic was what I was getting when they had me sign the contract on the first and even on the second contract.I have a NASCAR resale store where my customers like to watch the race while they shop. Now they have taken those channels off my list of channels. Complaints have been coming in from my customers about not being able to watch the race. Losing customers as these are hurting my business."
1,"My service was interrupted for past due payment of August 2010 (13 days). Someone outside the finance department contacted me Saturday, September 4th, 2010, stating if I pay half the amount my services, which include phone, DSL, and cable, I will be back up if I make this $95.00 payment and the remaining balance on the 21st of September. Once I paid her on the phone, she stated that my service will be back up. I asked her if they were going to reimburse me for the almost two weeks of not having either service and she said yes and it will take at least 2 billing cycles to show on account.I contacted Comcast today (October 18th 2010) and stated that my service was interrupted and I will not get my bill prorated. I don't understand. If I wasn't able to use any service, not even phone and watch television, why was I still getting bill and didn't get to watch? I think this is thief for a company to charge me for almost two weeks with not one service available and tell me that they will prorate the bill just to get a payment."
1,"The following is an e-mail written in frustration to the Comcast Technical Supervisor, I had been dealing with concerning picture quality on my TV from Comcast Cable. The most recent problem did not have anything to do with a technical problem, but billing, but I felt I would notify Michael ** (supervisor) anyway.Once again I have to spend my time dealing with an issue with Comcast. It is not picture quality this time, it is billing. As you know in 2009, we customers were told (multiple letters and TV announcements) to get a free cable box to replace the one we had, as if not we more than likely will lose some channels. So, trusting Comcast I got the cable box. You know the problems I had with picture quality, but interestingly enough after the last technician fixed something in the equipment on the roadside pole I have had an acceptable picture quality (except when the temperature changes). I have been enjoying my service since the ""correction."" She said something about a increase charge for a DVR - I assume she is talking about the free cable box I was told by Comcast I would need.I told her, I don't use a DVR, so she said she would have a technician come down tomorrow (Wednesday, Oct. 13th), between 11:00 A.M. and 1:00 P.M. to remove my DVR (I assume cable box) and give me another cable box. This way she could reduce my charge down by $7.00 or so. Now, I suspect that my picture quality will not be as good as what I have now. And, I will do whatever I have to do to make Comcast honor their agreement of another six months of $61.21. I have already investigated other providers, or I will just increase Netflix (get a Wii so I can watch movie, etc. on my television set). Yearly cost would be much cheaper than Comcast and less aggravating) and forgo watching cable television, as the aggravation isn't worth it. I have reached the point just before the ""Point Of No Return"" with Comcast. It is not only the issue of additional $17.71 increase charge, but more the point of trusting what I have been told. All I want to do is be able to watch my television (only a small number of selective shows anyway) without having to deal with Comcast every six months or so about one thing or another. Than you for reading this. Additional Information: In the summer of 2009, Comcast sent letters, post cards and even advertised on television that there would be a change in signal o Aug. 28, 2009, and customers would have to get a new cable box or lose stations. The box was free. So, I called and one was shipped.For over a year, I had continuous problems with picture quality and although the Technical Supervisor came down and replaced wiring, etc. It did not solve the problem. It was intermittent in that weeks would go by and picture was fine, then changed terribly. Last Spring 2010, a different technician came down and the problem was something bent on the box atop the roadside pole, something the ""supervisor"" failed to notice.So, for well over a year, I had nothing but stress and having to make phone calls to Comcast with no real results. I received an e-mail back from the above e-mail I sent Mike ** and this is the response: ""George, thanks for the email. I wished you would have emailed me sooner. I could have taken care of you. Your picture quality will not change at all. The free box was for customers that had no cable boxes at all, they are entitled to two free digital adapters. I see the work was already done for you today. If you have any questions please let me know. Thanks again.""I responded with the following as I was angry in that Mr. ** always seemed to place the responsibility on the customer: Michael, I called Comcast as soon as I got my bill with the increase. In 2009, I ordered the cable box as I was instructed to by Comcast.I only did what I got letters, postcards, TV advertisements told me to do. If Comcast sent me a box with a DVR, it is Comcast mistake, not mine. I am not a technician and only trust what I am being instructed to do. And if Comcast sent me something (a DVR cable box) I didn't ask for I believe any additional cost should be carried by Comcast. Your statement in your e-mail proves my point. They should have know the equipment I had originally.The representative I just spoke to mentioned only reducing my cost by about $7.00. I feel this is outrageous especially another representative told me that my cost of $61.21 would be extended for another 6 months. It seems at Comcast the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. So, the past year plus aggravation, I experienced was as a result of Comcast's error. I think you might want to meet with the CEO's of Comcast and bring this to their attention. And I could not have e-mailed you if I didn't know there was a problem until I got a bill with an increase. **I am more than likely paying more and now after taking out the cable box and replacing it with a different one, I know am getting less service."
1,"A payment was made to Comcast on 9/15/10. It was cashed on 9/21/10. I called Comcast to find out why it was not applied to the account on10/5/10. They did not know why. They requested a copy of the cased check. They would do a research on it. They said to take it to the nearest local office. I took a copy of the cashed check to the nearest office on the 6th, and they said that they would have to research the issue. I received a call from that office and they said that the check would not appear for 30 days after it arrived on the 15th of October. I called to the customer service and went on the online chat help.They said that this was a policy. On the 15th, I called to see why the check had not been applied to the account. They had no record of the check. It was clear that the check was cashed. They said to go to the local office on the 16th. I went to the local office on the 16th. They had no record of the check and said that they would have to research the issue. They said that a collection agency as involved, but they could not contact the agency. They said that the dat4e would be 30 would have to research the issue. I contacted the customer service office and they said that they would have to research the issue."
1,"In Sep-11, I got a call on Saturday morning. It was a sales representative from Comcast, offering me a new deal for $14.00 which it was supposed to include 200 new channels and a DVR. I was like for real, with a DVR to record stuff from TV? The representative said, Yes a DVR. I was like, is there is any extra fee for that? And he said No (due to the fact that I'm most of the day out of my house, I was like, well that sounds like a good deal, so I can record TV documentaries). So then he later transferred me to a supervisor to re-confirm all the stuff that I was going to be getting. And she said, well you are going to be getting 200 more channels + a DVR, not contract...(plus everything related to payments and how long this price would last) so I was like ""ok, thanks"" then I went back to the sales representative who told me. Ok you will be getting this package starting next weekend. An installer is going to be at your house next weekend.Then the weekend came, and the guy got here on time, when he is getting ready to install the cable box. I asked him ""is that the DVR?"" No, this order doesn't have DVR is just a regular cable box. He told me to call Comcast to have it figure out about the DVR. I called Comcast, and I spoke with a representative, she told me that, that package didn't have not DVR. Then I spoke with a manager called ""Jason."" He told me that he was going to call the sales office in Orlando, because that office was the one that has processed my order. He was going to call me in one hour. He never calls me after a week. I call them back but still not answer. After talking with a relative, he told me a lady at the doctor office, while he was waiting for his appt. He was telling him that she has had a problem with her new package with which supposed to have a DVR. It was exactly as my problem (he told me). I thought I was the only one out there, but I guess there might be more people out there being lying at to just to get them on a new package."
1,"I was a Comcast's customer for years, after it took over Florida Cablevision. What first got my attention was how programs were shifted around to different 'tiers', meaning I'd have to pay more to watch programs I had previously gotten with my account. I also had to take a ton of sports and Hispanic channels, which I had no use for. Then came the frequent increases in service costs, driving my bill up from around $60 a month to over $100.One service change came in the form of a letter, telling subscribers to pick 1 of a few bundles listed, as the company was making channel changes. No information on the bundles, including no listed costs. I had to call customer service to figure it out and basically was told I'd be paying more for the same service no matter what I did. Then, since I'm a night person, I discovered over 60% of my night time viewing channels, that used to replay the days shows, now were packed with paid programming and infomercials. So, I was paying for service that now had been reduced in quality.I did note, years ago, how easily Comcast managed to get the act of 'stealing cable' or making an illegal hookup raised from a misdemeanor to a felony. With more serious crimes about being classified as misdemeanors, I wondered how much Comcast had paid congressmen to push that law through. I liked the pay-per-view, until I discovered that I'd pay about $5.99 for a movie, only to find it being played for free on one of the prime stations 6 months later.Then the infomercials started expanding from between midnight and 6 AM to mornings until around 9 AM. I assumed Comcast made more money from them, so was going to throw them in everywhere, since, after all, they are technically a monopoly in most areas. I dumped Comcast and got AT&T. Including DSL Internet. I didn't discover until later that Comcast bought AT&T high speed Internet which was never mentioned in any of the information I read before signing up for it. Like a cancer, they seem to be spreading. Monopolies are illegal in the US, but apparently, Comcast is above the law."
1,"Comcast offered a promotional deal, $10 high speed internet for twelve months with a cable package. I had them install it in one room because I have DirecTV so I didn't need the cable, but wanted it installed in case I got a television in that room later. Well four months later, they decided to cancel it because the tech didn't get the cable installed and so I got billed the full amount for internet, which was a $60 increase. Well, they never notified me and it was the tech's fault for not installing it so I refused to pay the bill which is now $143. I paid my $15 the promotion and that's it. I will never use Comcast again."
1,"I moved from my former address to my current address in July. When I received my bills I paid them. I realized that the Comcast bills were not just being forwarded to the new address they were actually for the old address too. I called today to ask that my $333.59 be returned to me. They wanted to keep it and credit toward my new address. They then said that I would receive a phone call in 3-4 days from someone to discuss it.I said none of this is acceptable and asked to speak to a supervisor. After being on hold for close to 9 minutes, Akidra transferred me to Ebony. Ebony had no authority to make any changes. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she said there were none. This is the last straw for Comcast for me. They sent technicians to my house that were subcontractors that barely spoke English. He tried to charge me extra for phone jacks, made the cable too short so I am unable move the box, left dirty foot prints all over the house, left the covers half screwed on wall, and left hand prints on my silk chairs. I am switching back to Verizon."
1,"I dad problems with their service since day one! Everything that was on the contract for the agreement was false; they even claimed that it was not from them and that they never came by the house with the contract at all, period. It's all lies! Prices go up all the time! !They are always saying one thing, then never coming through and the changes are always for the worst. They are like most cable companies, a scam, and they need to be stopped. Thank you."
1,"I completed the construction on my new home and moved in the first week of December 2009. I’ve been living in Comcast ** ever since. I have cable, telephone and Internet!1) Comcast discontinued my service at the prior residence 2 weeks and again 1 week before requested and then continued billing me after the service once discontinued. It took several months to straighten out. Lots of empty promises!2) New service was started at my new residence, never got the billing correct. They set up two accounts in error and double billed me for some of the services, which is supposed to be one account. It took them three months to consolidate the account. I have received over 40 bills, none of them correct, promises by Comcast to correct them has proven futile, like Russian roulette!3) They eventually got the two accounts consolidated into one, but the resulting billing is impossible to comprehend/decipher. They’re still making adjustments despite their promises that it has been corrected. Still not right. How would know? Comcast clearly does not. They never call back when they promise to and never able to meet their commitments.4) Their billing staff is genuinely well-intentioned, but helpless in the Comcast maze; powerless to really fix anything. Their technical staff is excellent also and has more power and provides good service.5) I’m actively seeking alternatives! Comcast reminds me of AOL in its worst days. I will never use AOL services ever again and don't think I will ever use Comcast services ever again, I would rather do without!Comcast is constantly threatening to discontinue service. Building a new home is stressful enough, this just compounds it ten fold! I should have discontinued service months ago, but I need the Internet. Rest I could do without for awhile."
1,"I just got services with Comcast. I work and go to school. I can't go to the store or even call them. I get my bill and they want me to pay for a reconnection fee 2 services fee and one for a additional TV line. The tech came to my home, placed the cable all around my apartment where my kids were playing and got hurt because the tech didn't install it right! I tried to contact them and I have to go to the office for them to even look at my bill. I told the CSR on the live chat that I'll make my payment when my bill gets fixed. Why have the 24 hrs support if they can't even answer questions and tell you go to the office?"

1,"On or around 6/12/10, I called Comcast to cancel my service. On 6/15/10, I dropped off all of my equipment and figured I was done. But no, Comcast continued to bill my credit card in June and July for service from 6/14 to 7/13 and 7/14 to 8/13. When I received the first erroneous statement and billing, I immediately called customer service. This would be my first call of approximately 10-15, where I was told that Comcast was sorry for the mistake, that it was all taken care of, and that I wouldn't receive any more erroneous bills or charges. I was billed again the next month, at which point I called my credit card company to stop any future billings and help me get my money back. Long, long, long and exhausting story short, I have wasted 15 to 20 hours of my time trying to clear things up. Each customer service person, I spoke with assured me everything was taken care of, but over and over, I continued to receive statements and demands to pay them. The reps I spoke with told me to disregard the statements because the systems were still being updated. In September, I received a call from a collections department (not sure if it was internal to Comcast or external). Immediately, I called back the collections department to find out what the heck was going on. The woman I reached apologized when I told her all I had been through, and she said she would be upset too. Again, I called Comcast customer service and was told by the rep that there was no record of my account going to collections. At that point, I hung up and called the sales department. I spoke to a nice man and asked him if he could look up my account and tell me how what he saw. He apologized after I told him my story and told me that what he could see was that a number of adjustments had been made to my account and that I owed $10.83. I told him I didn't believe that if I paid that $10.83 that I would really be done with this all. How prescient was that? But he assured me. So, I paid the $10.83 in September, and then on 10/7/10, I get a bill for $174.38. This last one said that if I didn't pay it immediately, my account would be referred to a collections agency. Are you kidding me? Again, I called Comcast customer service and spoke with XX (I started collecting names at this point, but should have months ago). I told her that I had received a bill and that it said if I didn't pay it immediately it would go to collections. She said don't worry Ms. XX, you don't owe any money to Comcast. That statement went out before your account was adjusted. Right now your account shows a $0 balance, and I can assure you that you are not being reported to collections. Imagine my surprise this morning (10/11/10), when I received a call from a collections agency. Actually, it wasn't a total surprise, because I expected nothing other than complete incompetency from Comcast at this point.Honestly, all of the customer service people have treated me with the utmost respect, but none of them knew what they were doing. They didn't know what they were seeing in the account systems. They gave me misinformation after misinformation. Maybe it wasn't even their fault as Comcast probably has incompetent IT systems. Never in my life have I had a worse experience with a company, and I cant just let it rest. I have reported this whole fiasco to the BBB and am considering contacting a news organization. Someone at Comcast needs to go through all the tapes of my phone calls to customer service and review the statements that were sent to me each month. Comcast clearly has some major technical and training issues that need to be addressed. I ended up paying the $$ to the collections agency to prevent a mar on my 800+ credit report. I honestly can't tell from my statements if this is even money I owe, but I know I don't want my score ruined over it.I am still expecting to get a statement next month billing me for service in October! Thinking about all I have gone through trying to sever my relationship with Comcast just makes me sick. Right now we have ATT Uverse and love it. I will never go back to Comcast and will tell all my friends and family to stay away."
1,"When I switched from AT&T to COMCAST the technician told me that I would get the HD DVR free for 12 months. Almost two months later, I notice my bill says it is free for only 3 months. I called COMCAST and am told it is only free for 3 months and there is nothing they can do. I speak with the COMCAST supervisor (Jeremy) and he says I need to call the technician who did my install and deal direct with him. I ask the billing supervisor (Jeremy) if he truly thinks that a customer should be dealing with his employee in this nature and he said yes.I ask to speak with his supervisor and he is adamant that he does not have a supervisor. Wow, is he the CEO or something? He refuses to provide me with any names or numbers and finally says he has an email address for another supervisor; however, he is not able to provide that data to me. I called back on another phone and speak with a customer service rep who provided me with another number for a supervisor. I called that number and it goes to an answering machine. It says to leave your name and number and they will call you right back.12 days later and nothing. I called COMCAST back and speak with another supervisor and get the same **: the HD DVR is only free for 3 months and then I will have to pay. He also tells me that the standard DVR would cost the same amount after 3 months, though my initial contract called for a free standard DVR for 12 months.Bottom line, if a COMCAST employee says you’re upgraded to a HD DVR free for 12 months, then that is what you should get. This company has extremely poor customer service and unethical installers and supervisors. I now have to pay for a DVR, whether it is HD or standard, on a monthly basis ($10 a month). It’s just another way for this company to stick it to you and get more money from you.I never had such a problem with AT&T and look forward to returning to an ethical company who knows how to make their customers happy. I highly recommend that no one ever becomes a customer of COMCAST. They make things sound so great; however, their service is slow and their people skills are non-existent. 1 out of 10 (10 being the best): I would rate COMCAST at a 2!"
1,For the last two weeks I have trying to get a tech to my house to exchange my DVR and cable boxes and start internet (modem and router). The first time the tech was to visit he called and asked if he could reschedule because of the weather. I assured him that would be fine to come that Thursday. Thursday he arrived late and then proceeded to say he could not do the work and he would have to come back.Now the next appointment was for Saturday between 8:00 and 11:00 a.m. Of course he never showed up or called. I was extremely upset about the lack of courtesy and professionalism. Now I had to call Comcast on Tuesday to see why no one had called and why the tech had never showed up. They said a technician would come on Saturday. Of course no one ever showed up or called. Here we are again on a second Saturday that I have had to waste waiting for someone from Comcast to shop up. Comcast is extremely incompetent.
1,"During the last storm both TVs started to switch off while the cable box remained on. I live in a condo bldg. None of my neighbors had a problem; no other piece of equipment in my home had a problem I did not even have to reset a clock, everything bigger than a clock is on a surge protector. We called Comcast and they suggested unplugging the cable from the signal source and power, wait, re hook and then they sent a refresh signal. This worked for 1 TV but not the other; we retried this several times, no luck. I brought the cable box down to their office and exchanged it, no luck, they sent several techs out. Everyone wanted to blame lightning or my TV but I do not believe my TV could break the one in the other room and wouldn't lightning have some other effect?No one had an answer for this. Finally after many calls I got a supervisor who agreed the right thing was to file a damage claim and promised it would be settled soon, per protocol she had to send the tech supervisor ok. He called after the 72 hour window I was given and after I called around looking for him. By now a couple of weeks have passed. He promised to be at my home by 11am and after I called around again he came a bit before 1pm. He to tried to blame other things but could not explain what was mentioned above, agreed to process the claim and told me to expect a check 24 hours after the claim was filed. Too bad he told the claims lady it was my fault and he did not know why I was calling the insurance co to settle.Then the icing on the cake I am reviewing my bill and originally I had a bundle that included 1 DVR and I paid for a second. When I turned in the faulty box that fried my TV I downgraded and so now I am charged for the 1 DVR. When I called the woman on the phone said I will call you back. Geez-louise I bet they can't face me.They should feel bad. Fios is not available in my area and the know it. All those automated call backs to see if I am happy because customer service is important? Do I laugh, cry? Move into a cave. I even offered the tech sup to take the broken TV to examine it but they did not want to."
1,"Comcast ran a test of the emergency broadcast system during the bottom of the 8th inning of the first playoff game between the Twins and the Yankees. It wasn't a short test, either. I tried to call Comcast to complain about it and was put through voicemail hell. Then I tried to email my complaint. There is no way to issue an email complaint that doesn't conform to their complaint template, they bounce it right back to you. I think they deserve to have a special nuisance tax imposed on them. "
1,"Every time Comcast ""updates"" the system, something on our HDTV unit quits working. We are paying top dollar (we have to as we live in Hurricane Zone) for reliable service just for that reason and we seem to always have some issues. The net is slow, the box is not receiving or ""on and on and on"" ! The worst part is their customer service dept. It takes dozens of calls to even get ""into the lines."" Then you get bounced around to many deparmentts with inept people that in the end don't help. The bottom line is you end up missing work (money) to have to wait for a home tech to arrive who usually says ""that's a company issue and it's not related to your homes wiring etc."" Thus, I didn't need to miss work in the first place. "
1,"I have had a Comcast for a while until we recently moved and bought a house. The person we bought the house from warned me not to get Comcast. I stayed with them anyway. Now, we have been here for almost a year and within the year, we have had technicians come out more than 15 times. Each time, each one tells me something different. Now, I am paying this service. We are not able to even watch television more than 10 minutes and I get so tired of calling them so we just turn the TV off and watch movies. However, this is not right because I pay my bill each month yet I get no service. Now they are telling me that it has something to do with the line and electricity in my home. I think they are trained to say this because Comcast ****. I had an electrician come out but he says that there is nothing wrong with the electricity and also when we bought the house, the inspection was cleared. So now, I called to have another technician come out and now they want to charge me $49.00. I guess because they have been out here so much and most of those technicians they hire, do not know what they are doing. Now, I have pocketed out money to the electrician when I know that there was nothing wrong. Comcast is saying it is on my side. I refuse to continue to give them my money when we get no service. The TV’s display looks like a puzzle, the little black box keeps coming up saying your service will resume shortly and it never does. I really do not understand how Comcast stays in business. If everyone would stop using them, maybe they would go out of business because they are a terrible company and do not care about the customers but just want to make money."
1,"I left for vacation one week ago and my cable service was fine.  When I returned, I discovered that I had lost one fifth (10) of my cable channels, because my set lacked the necessary digital enhancements to access them.  I contacted Comcast and spoke with two service representatives (Jane and Joy) and a supervisor named Heather about this and was told that I should have received written notice of this policy change.  I explained that I hadn't and wasn't interested in their digital upgrade.  All three explained that it was optional.  I then said that since I wasn't participating in their new program, I felt that my monthly bill should be proportionately reduced.  The supervisor that I ultimately spoke with (Heather) confirmed that while participation was optional, if I didn't elect to participate, I would still lose the ten channels that I previously had access to with no reduction in my monthly bill.How is that ethical, moral or even legal?  I thought I had a contract with this company and I've always upheld my obligation.  What about their end?  I lose one fifth of the programming that I've enjoyed for over a decade with no reduction in my monthly bill."
1,"I ordered the new digital TV boxes. They came and I tried to connect the 5 TV. Nothing happened. I called and made an appointment for Sunday October 3rd 8-12. No one came or called. When I called, Salt Lake-- Mason and Robert said the service call was disconnected. No one called me. When I call Comcast the electronic answering says you have an appointment. I called again and now have an appointment for Monday, October 4th at 4-6 PM. I wasted 4 hours today waiting for the repair man."
1,"A week ago a man stole a truck and was speeding through our neighborhood when that individual hit a power pole. Shortly after that incident, we began having cable internet issues. It was solely internet issues and not any other issues with the cable TV. I called and had a technician come out to our house and replace the modem and then he told me it was all fixed. He gave me his supervisor's number and his number. About an hour after he left, the same problem happened. It was going out again, so I called back and he came back over and was working on it again. He told me, once more, that everything was fine and he fixed it.This time, it worked for a little under 24 hours and started going out all over again, so I called Comcast back and this time asked to speak to a supervisor because they said it would be a few days later. The person on the line told me that the supervisor was on the other line and that she would call me back in a few minutes. I waited almost 2 hours and never received a call back. I called again and the person on the phone said the same thing again. Supervisors on the phone with a customer, and that my information would be passed on. It was late in the evening, but I waited and never got a call back. The internet went out again at around midnight and I did not come back on at all until 6:00 the next morning. But, then went back out at 6:30. I called Comcast again and spoke with a lady named Tron.She said there was nothing she could do, but she was at least helpful and transferred me to a local dispatch to see if they could do more to help. When this person answered, his name was Nick; I began to retell the problem for the 6th time. I also told him that they had already replaced my modem and that I already had a ticket out, I just wanted to have them escalate it since this was an ongoing problem from a previous visit. He proceeded to ask me if I wanted to start a new ticket since I was reporting a problem. I told him that I already had a ticket and was looking for a bit more information. I explained everything and his response was ""what do you want me to do about it"" and then told me that he reset my modem and everything was fine and that I probably didn't need someone to come out since it was working. After that, I was kind of irritated, but I know that the only way to get assistance is to keep my calm, so I did. I told him that it does this, it goes out, but then comes back on and will work for a bit, but will go out again. He told me that my problem was just my router, but the previous technician already ruled that out and I had ruled that out by connecting directly into the router and still seeing the problem. So, he said that maybe we just needed to replace the modem.I reminded him that I had already told him that the last time someone was here, they replaced it with a brand new one and it was showing the same problem as the previous one that had worked fine for a year without issue whatsoever. He continued to say that he couldn't have anyone come out any time soon and he wasn't looking to ask. I reminded him again, that this wasn't a new request, but an extension of the previous visit that was never fixed. I got a bit frustrated and asked why I was paying for a service I couldn't use. He said that wasn't his problem and if I needed that resolved, to talk to someone else in another department. This is one of the biggest issues. I asked him what was going to happen if I couldn't get the work done that I needed to do and what would happen about my wife and her online distance learning classes. He told me that I should just cross my fingers and hope that it doesn't go out while we're doing that. Flat out, he said I should just hope that my connection that I'm paying for works when it is needed. No need to rely on proper service at all. I asked to speak to his supervisor after that and he responded by asking me why. I just repeated that I wanted to speak to the supervisor and he again asked why. This went on for a minute or so. When he responded with ""Oh, he's on the other line right now, do you want me to have him return your call later?” I told him about the multiple previous times I'd heard that statement and never received a phone call and that I could wait to speak with him while on the phone discussing the issues. He then told me to tell him what my problem was and he would relay that to his boss and then he would tell his supervisor and his supervisor would be caught up on the problem right away and speak to me immediately. So, my response was ""So, you lied about your supervisor being on the phone a moment ago?I asked to speak with him and you said that he was on the other line and said he would call me back, but now, immediately after that, you say that all I have to do is tell you why I want to speak with him and he'll be here right away? “He paused for a bit, but then said yes. He said as long as I tell him what the problem is, that I could speak to the boss, so I finally said that my problem was the representative's attitude with which I was speaking.So, he told me that wasn't a valid reason to ask for a supervisor. I just repeated that I wanted to speak to the supervisor several times while he said I had no reason to do so. Again, I reminded him that if I told him the reason, he'd put on the supervisor. I held up my end and it was time for him to reciprocate. He put on his supervisor, but I sat on hold for 5 minutes. Chris was the supervisor's name. I asked him if he'd been briefed on everything and he said somewhat, so I allowed him to begin telling me the issues and what was being done. It was very clear very soon that he had no clue what was going on. So, I told him what his representative said to me and he told me that they'd deal with that in house and I shouldn't worry about it. So, I told him the rest of the problems I was having and he told me that I should just go somewhere else, like a library or a Star Bucks, to do the work that I needed and my wife should do the same.So, instead of staying home and doing what I can do from home, I should go somewhere else and do my work from another location while I pay for the service at home. I asked to speak to his supervisor when he said he didn't have one. Finally, he said that I could call the corporate line and gave me that number. I spoke to an assistant there and went over everything that I had issues with. She said that my complaints were valid and that the Regional Manager would be giving me a call in the day to get everything taken care of. I got a call at 4:45 PM from the Regional Director, but I was not able to get to the phone on time to answer it. I immediately called the number she left with me, but got a voice mail saying that if the call was after 5:00 then I'd have to wait until the next day to hear it.I called before 5:00 PM. It took 1 minute to listen to the message and write down the number and dial the number and call her back. It is currently the next day at 3:30 PM and I still have not heard back from that manager. The technicians came out and said that since the problem wasn't happening now, then I wasn't going to get much help from them. But, every time I call is when I'm having the problem and they have to schedule an appointment which means that I have to once again, hope and cross my fingers that everything will be fine while they aren't here, but then also hope and cross my fingers that it'll be out when they are here to get everything fixed. Work that has to be done cannot be done in the convenience of my house where I'm paying for internet service. This is my problem that I'm having with Comcast."
1,"A sales rep. came to my door, gave me information and then asked if he could come in, and I said no. I took the information and said I would look into it and if interested I would call. He then came back to my home a few days later at 8:00 pm, then again on Saturday around 1:00 pm. I did not answer the door on either occasion.Again this Saturday, 9-25-2010, around 1:00 in the afternoon, I was in my garage and my neighbors came over and this Comcast rep pulls in my drive way and when he saw me and my neighbors, he pulled out of my drive way. I told my neighbors who he was and they stated that he has been at my home several times when I wasn't home. I went in the house and called Comcast to file a complaint. I had to call 3 times and was put on hold from 25 to 40 minutes each time and then finally the said they would have a supervisor call me before 5:00 pm. They took all the information regarding the complaint and my address. I heard them typing this call took about 20 minutes. No one called me.I called again on Monday, 9-27-2010. I couldn't get a supervisor, called again today, 9-28-2010, and told them if a supervisor did not get on the line now, I would contact the newspaper, TV and my attorney regarding this serious matter. I finally spoke with a Salvadore and he said that he would take all the info and pass it along to his boss and they will start an investigation, he gave me a case ticket number. I don't believe this because he said there was nothing in the system regarding me ever calling on Saturday. This company to me is really something and doesn't care about the people out there, especially when they are single women like myself who is being stalked by one of their employees."
1,"Comcast Customer Services sucks! Okay, we have been trying unsuccessfully to get Comcast to run co-axle cable in our home for a year. The wire was bad from the get go and we told them that. We scheduled service online, paid for installation of co-axle as if the house didn't have existing lines. Service tech #1 shows up, argues that we don't need new co-axle, he can just repair the existing line for an additional fee. One week later, we loose all of our movie channels and channels begin randomly blacking out. So we were charged for the new line that never happened and the repair that didn't work.We called Comcast Customer Service and was told to tighten the lines. This didn't help so we had service tech #2 come out. He fiddled at the pole but again said that we didn't need new line ran in the house even though we paid to have it done. We had quality service for all of 3 days. After several more calls and emails, we stopped calling Comcast until this week when our phone and internet went down. First they told us that the storms fried our modem, we argued that the modem was fine. They told us a technician would be out in 3 days.I emailed the VP explaining all of the trouble we have had with our cable. He apologized and refunded the amount of the lines that were not ran. At least with the 3rd tech that came out, I didn't have to blow a vacation day. He ran a line from the pole to the house but said he did not have authority to run line in the house. I showed him the email from the VP's office. He said, ""Nope, can't fix the problem, I need different tools, authorization from a higher up and more money. About $32 an hour with a minimum of two hours to fish line from the basement to the second floor.""He encouraged me to contact Comcast Customer Service to schedule another tech to come out. He did manage to get the phone and internet back up. He was able to convince customer service that it wasn't the modem and to just push the signal through. He asked, ""why we didn't do it that way?""Sigh, could it be because Comcast's Customer Service sucks?! I give up. I'm calling FIOS in the morning. Sure, they'll still have to fish the line though the wall, but maybe they won't argue with me for a year before doing it. Besides right now, they're offering a similar package with both Encore and Showtime for half of what I've been paying Comcast. I hope everyone else can learn from my mistakes of giving them the benefit of the doubt."
1,"The Customer Service Representative at Comcast intentionally told me misleading information two days in a row.  They also allowed me and my family to live in a house with no phone services for two days and my house could have burned down or my children could get sick and die by the time I'll get somewhere to call for help.  I lost a total of two days that I was waiting on a technician that was not on the way and when the technician came and hooked up my internet, he took my 36 dollar card that I purchased on my own.When I called to add the internet that the CSR told me that all I needed to do was get the card and I will have the internet and that was untrue and a waste of money because after it was opened, it couldn't be returned."
1,"I am not receiving the services for which I am paying - On-Demand and the menu guide services.  I have not been receiving these services for many months.  I just noticed this discrepancy last week and contacted Comcast about the issue.  They scheduled a cable appointment for today, September 24 from 2 pm-6 pm.  I was sitting in my bedroom, studying for my A+ certification exam tomorrow, and no one knocked on my door.  They instead called me at 4:25 pm and stated that no one was at home.  This is a lie.  I was home and waiting for them to arrive to fix my services.  I then called the customer service department.  First, Andrea just placed me back into the phone queue, without helping me.  Then, finally after 5 minutes, Doris told me that no one would come after 5 pm today.  She then stated that I didn't deserve a credit because On-Demand is free service.  I have never had it, and should have had this service."
1,"I was scammed by a person acting as if he was a Comcast representative.  Not only was I scammed once, but twice.  I am working with a security investigator from Comcast in which I have done everything he has asked me to do.  Copy of the fraudulent check, police report--within one and a half months, Comcast has gotten a total of $900.00.  Who pays $900.00 for cable?  I just found out that the fraudulent check was reversed back to my account.  My services have been disconnected.  We have no way of knowing what we are paying for.  Please help.  Comcast is totally aware of this situation and is ripping me off."
1,"My issue was originally diagnosed on August 27th as a weak signal in the underground cable line coming into my house. The technician ordered a new line to be installed on Sept 2nd. It is now Sept 23rd, and the line has still not been installed. For the past month, I have made over 10 calls to Comcast, and have been promised that the crew will be at my house to install the line ""the next day"". I have intermittent TV and internet connections that go in and out randomly, and I am at my wit's end. None of the customer service reps or supervisors I have spoken to have been helpful at all."
1,"I have made multiple calls to Comcast since early July, 2010 regarding an intermittent problem with my cable signal that causes my sound, or both sound and picture to drop out for short durations ranging from 3-5 seconds to a minute or so. This can happen at any time. I was given a $51 credit on July 27, 2010. Since then the problem has continued.I have records of all my calls since July 27, who I spoke with and details. I was told by Omar (supervisor or manager) on September 20 that he would grant me $31 for credit. He said because he had no records of any calls except for one on August 29, that he could not give me credit for most of August. I called in August on 8/12, 8/17 and 8/29 and have notes of each call. He said he did not see them on his records.Today, 9/22/10, I call Comcast again to find out prices for no cable and get price for internet and phone only. In the process I explained my continuing problem to Jenifer. She said that she could see other calls in August besides the 8/29 call. On September 16 they came outside my home and ran a new wire from an outside box to my house. That did not solve the problem. Meanwhile Comcast expects me to continue to pay my bill and I am not getting the service I am paying for."
1,"I have been a Comcast Cable customer since 2003. I had the Digital Preferred Plus limited basic package. I currently pay $37.51 for that package. I received a letter from a Mr. Rafael ** (Director of Marketing Operations) 1-866-661-9987. The letter sates that after October 19, 2010, I will no longer receive the Digital Preferred package unless I sign up for the Digital Starter package which costs $81+ per month. I do not understand how they can change our original agreement just to increase their revenue. Please advise me to what my rights in this matter are. I am a senior citizen on a fixed income, and I cannot afford a $50 plus increase."
1,"We cancelled Comcast because of constant picture problems with a paper trail probably going back ten years. We always got a different answer everytime they came out. One serviceman told use there was a cable problem outside with a cost of over $20,000 that Comcast wasn't willing to spend the money to repair. We were also told it was our problem and they would have to charge us to replace the lines under the house. After numerous servicemen and several different answers, we switched to direcTV and have a perfect picture. The serviceman also stated that the neighbors were also having problems and it just wasn't us. We refused to pay the bill after they couldn't fix the problem and they sent it in to a collection agency. When you spend over a $100.00 a month, you expect quality, which we never had. Their customer service is horrific."
1,"On or about August of 2009, I was approached in my home by a young lady who introduced herself as Sabina. She said she was a representative of Comcast and noticed that I was a former customer and wanted to know why I switched. I explained that I was not happy with Comcast because they only offered discounts and good promotions to new accounts and I felt that as a long time customer in good standing with Comcast I and people like me deserved those special deals. She was very agreeable with me and promised me that Comcast was aware of this and was working to change their image and policies to be more accommodating to existing customers.She told me that Comcast was offering a $200.00 gift card to customers for returning to their service and offered me a one-year promotion package. She assured me that there was no contract other than the one-year promotion and that she or someone from Comcast would contact me before the end of the one year to offer me whatever promotion was available at that time. Reluctantly, I agreed.She made herself available and returned my phone calls thru the installation process and helped work out a couple of kinks. I went on line and signed up for my gift card as told and received it in the mail. This month when I went to pay my bill I pointed out to the clerk that there must be a mistake on my bill because it was $421.94 instead of the usual $108. Whatever. He informed me that it was because my promotion had ended and my new charges would be $314.38 for the same service.He told me to pay my normal amount and then call them to get another promotion since mine had ended just yesterday. When I call the lady on the phone insist that I was under contract because I got the $200.00 gift card and that the only way I could keep from paying $314.38 was to pay an early termination fee of $100.00 to cancel the new service that started yesterday and let her look for another promotion for me. This is ridiculous and is an obvious misrepresentation from Comcast and that Sabina, if that's her name.Who in their right mind would agree to go from paying $108 a month to $314 for the same service? That's crazy. And as for the gift card, I was told it was for going back to being a Comcast customer with no strings attached or I never ever would have applied for it. If I had any idea that getting it would hold me to any contract for any reason, I never would have applied for it. Now whatever contract they claim to have or might have was not signed under any other circumstances or pretenses than what I've stated.Comcast should be ashamed of how they lie and lure people into using their services by using lies, deceit and false representation. By the way, I am no longer able to get in touch with Sabina; she has not returned any of my calls. Is there a government agency that regulates or controls these people or do you think someone there can help me? I am so **. I would not have been able to afford this a year ago and I sure can't afford it now, not even the hundred dollars early termination fee that suddenly exists. I can't afford any of it and it's not what I agreed, too."
1,"My problem with Comcast is the new boxes for the High Definition TV. My husband hooked my mother up with her new boxes and they did not work.  He finally got the larger box to work but the smaller one was not working.  I called Comcast and they are receiving so many calls over the same thing that they cannot get to us for two weeks. I would like to see a reduction in our monthly bill as well as my husband paid by Comcast for three hours of work in his own home.  By the way, Comcast is trying to get all clients to work on their own sets because they are so backlogged with calls."
1,"I had made my bill payment for $100 over the phone, but when I got my bank statement, I saw that I was also charged a separate $100 through the web, something that I had never authorized. When I discussed this with Comcast they said, they had no record of this payment so there was nothing I could do but talk to my bank. Which resulted in me having to call and visit my bank to find any additional information about the fraudulent charge.My bank gives me all of the information they have regarding the charge, but it has already gone through, so there's no stop or reverse of the payment already made. I look through all the information, routing, and reference numbers, and figure out (despite the fact that I have little experience or knowledge in banking, collections, or Comcast's billing system) that they had charged that $100 to an entirely different account, not mine, which is why they couldn't trace it though our account.Since working this out, I have made numerous additional phone calls with no assistance, and was told I needed to go to their office. So, I waste my time and gas going there, just for them to tell me that: a) what I needed done, a form sent, could've been done over the phone, but apparently hadn't been done in the last 6 calls and b) there was no supervisor or manager available for me to speak with. I left all my contact information with the representative who assisted me (if it can be called that) with the express desire to have them contact me as soon as possible. I was told that the manager/supervisor would call me soon, and that the collections department (whom I had faxed all my banking information regarding where that fraudulent payment had went) would contact me in regards to the status of tracking down that payment.As of yet, I have received no calls, from anyone. No refund, no answers. I called again today and all they said is that they would fill out and send another form, and would contact me with the results in another 3-5 business days. I would like to note that this company states in their Customer Guarantee that Customer Account Representatives will be ""courteous and knowledgeable"" when you contact them, neither of which I found to be true, as they have only passed me back and forth between various people, only getting a form that needed to be sent after reaching the 9th or 10th person at the actual office, when I was told it should've been done over the phone.This guarantee also says that they will ""quickly address any problem you experience"" and ""be mindful of your time."" My problem has not been addressed properly by them in over a month in a half, and hours of my time (which bill-ably is worth considerably more than $100) have been wasted. However, I'm less concerned about the $100 and more concerned about doing business with a company that apparently will unwittingly take money from a client fraudulently, and then refuse to even get the problem properly addressed."
1,"For weeks now, I have been trying to replace my ""cable box"" which Comcast provided. After many calls, promising, driving to Comcast locations, and waiting in lines I do not have a new ""cable-box"" which was missed diagnosed 3-times and was told it would be delivered. This started early in August and now it's mid September."
1,"I had problems with HD cable and HBO. Called and got overseas support, we were going on vacation and he told me couldn't schedule more than 1 week in advance 'call back when I return. Did that and had to wait almost a week. Tech was polite and said cable from street to house had to be replaced. It is about 175' and goes from street to pole in neighbors yard then my house. He would submit when he went to shop, probably a week no more he said.After 4 days, I call and they say it is scheduled for tomorrow. Next day, no show and it is rescheduled tomorrow. This went on for 10 days. Finally at dusk 2, not so friendly Comcast employees show up.They proceed to run cable for 2 hours. At one point, I look out and they are parked on my lawn with headlights on house. No flashlights.They came to door and asked to check TV, it seemed to be working and they left. No paperwork. In morning, I come out and to my horror --the mess. They left, no lye 200' of cable all over driveway new cable. Empty water bottles I gave them on street. They smashed neighbors bush at end of driveway. They decided to run new route through middle of my yard 5' off ground into and draped over pine trees and a galvanized spike in a large old tree. Didn't take down old line cut it from pole at street and left connected and laying on neighbors yard.Repeated calls and email. Lots of supervisors promising to handle it and repair damage. Today is day 10 no sight and called and left message for follow up on resolved issue. Are you kidding me! Help."
1,"First of all, this happened back in the beginning of August the 1st, which I had 30 days to decide what I wanted to do. When I first spoke to the lady, who signed me up with the contract, I specifically told her I work for LabCorp and I asked her about the corporate discount. She said, we can give you a discount but with the package you have, it would be cheaper. So I decided to stay with the package. Then she told me, what I can do for you to substitute the discount is not to charge you for the installation and box fee. I told her, are you sure? She said, ""Yes and it would be only $29.99 plus tax. All I have to do is put a note and notify my supervisor. They'll call you back in 24 to 48 hours"". Since then, it has been the worst 3 weeks of my life. They never called me back and Paula, the supervisor, was really unprofessional."
1,"Comcast continues to move channels from its Basic Cable Service to Digital service. They do not, however, lower the price of the basic cable and then offer to sign up unhappy customers for digital service. So we are paying the same and getting less and less and less over time. "
1,"I have had so much trouble with this company! Some must be due to incompetence and some must be treachery. It took at least 5 techs to install. They keep quoting me one price on the phone, then billing me for another. They gave my unlisted phone number to some other company to make threatening calls to my mother and me about turning in equipment or paying $500 fines; the representative never told me I had to return any equipment after I had services downgraded. I spend at least an hour a week with these incompetents and/or liars. Tomorrow, I must take another day off work to go there in person and see what is going on. I cannot budget on my limited income if they keep jacking around the prices. They had no right to give my unlisted number to another entity. I just found out the installation technician took my mother's remote controls when he installed the cable. I have complained to the City of Mountain View as they hold the franchise. I will have to keep complaining. This is not right. They should not be allowed to operate a shoddy, misrepresentation of a business. "
1,"I recently moved into my apartment at the above mentioned address and the local Comcast installer came out to hook up my computer, cable and two televisions. Everything was working fine when he was done. However, since that day (I had not actually moved into the apartment until this past weekend, but when I had tried to turn the living room television on, I could not get it turned on), I cannot get the television to come on. There is power and the bedroom television works fine but not so with the living room television. I have been on hold for ridiculous amounts of time with Comcast, never being able to reach a human being. I have left messages with my Comcast ""salesperson"" Greg ***, who, when he was trying to sell me the ""triple play,"" could not do enough for me. Now I cannot even get him to call me back. I want this problem rectified immediately and moreover I want my cable bill adjusted accordingly to reflect that I have been completely without one of my televisions for at least 2 weeks since the installer did the initial work. "
1,"After having numerous issues with incorrect & bogus charges and service interruptions, as well as dealing with the Corporate office, I was assured my account was corrected & I had a zero balance & no further issues should arise. I had them correct my account back to the services ordered (""triple play"") & because they incorrectly & w/o my permission or knowledge had changed my services. I confirmed with both the rep & corporate office (Jack Carroll) that I would not be charged for any maintenance or activation charges associated with correcting my services.I was assured by a representative that my account was credited & is current, but today find another rep (""Glenn"") who stated not only was it not done, but he could not correct it because the charges were on the bill & he could not remove them. I spent several hours throughout the day trying to get it resolved, all the while my service is ""inactive"" & not on while they try to say that because these charges still on the bill & saying they are ""past due"" when they aren't even valid charges therefore impossible to be past due. They caused me several hours of back & forth & 2 days of lost service."
1,"I currently have Comcast as my Internet service provider. My mother had them at this same address before I moved here. We have nothing but problems with them. My mother had every service Comcast had to offer. The TV, phone, and Internet hardly even worked. Comcast came out and told us there were signal issues with the lines. They did nothing to fix it. My mother had no choice but to cancel her services. Now, I am living here. It has been a few months since my mother turned off the Comcast services at this address. I was thinking since it was a few months later maybe Comcast finally fixed the problems. I decided to try out just the Internet. The Internet is constantly not working. Comcast would send techs out, and they wouldn't even get out of the truck. Finally, a few weeks ago, they sent out a tech. He was the only one that actually investigated the situation. He took signal readings and what not. He confirmed there were signal issues out on the pole. The tech said Comcast would be out the fallowing day to work on the lines. I contacted the corp. office the following day because it was around PM and still Comcast did not show. After speaking to them, a Comcast tech came out with a bucket truck and was checking the signals on the line. I got a call back from Paul Navin from Comcast. He said that the tech found no problems with the lines. I told him about the tech that was here the day before that said there was issues. He said that tech was a very good tech. One of the best. I said well why did he say there was issues and now your telling me there isn't? Then he changed his story and said that it was and issue with whoever provides Comcast their Internet service. He said he would look into it and gave me his email address and telephone number for me to email him all the results of the tests and stuff that I ran. I did just that. I was having problems getting the emails to go threw, and tried to call Paul **. He would not return my phone calls. I called the corp office at Comcast. A woman called me back, and said they would no longer be sending any techs out to my address. She said as far as Comcast is concerned, the issue is resolved. I am still having ongoing issues. I contacted the local franchise authority about Comcast not fixing the problem. I spoke to Pat ** from the Union township municipal building. He said that he was having issues at the municipal building with the Comcast services there as well as his house. He said he has personally contacted Comcast numerous times. They have not resolved the problems. I informed him I am having the same situation. Pat said there wasn't much they could do. I contacted the FCC about the situation. They seamed interested in hearing what was going on. They are looking into the matter. However, they said that it is really my local franchise authorities responsibility. I notified Comcast that I would be going threw the FCC to hopefully get the problem resolved. After Paul ** was informed of me going to the FCC, he sent me a letter today. The letter states Comcast is turning off my services effective Sept. 21, 2010. It says Comcast is also going to waive any balance on my account. I don't feel that Comcast should be able to pick and choose who they want as customers. The contract with the city says they will provide services to the residents of my town. It doesn't say they will provide services to the customers they want to. I feel that it is wrong if not illegal for Comcast to do these things. They clearly think they are above the law, and can do what ever they want. I feel that my mother and I are victims of discrimination. I have email numerous corp. employees from Comcast to get the problems resolved. All emails have gone unanswered."
1,I arranged for auto-pay from my bank. Comcast should supply the bill to the bank and it will be paid. Comcast supplies the bill not consistently; it either sends charge for two months or does not charge at all. It happens again and again. And every time it does not charge - it disconnects my service. Then Comcast charges me fee for connecting it back. I spent hours upon hours with the customer service. They assured me not once that things are in order - and then they play this game again. I am frequently without a service. And I am paying fees for Comcast's mistakes.
1,"Comcast ran a promotion back in March 2010: $200 Visa Gift Card for signing up with the clause of receiving it upon the completion of 90 days paid service. I have been a customer since 3/23/10, I paid on time, and I still have not received my call. Although I have made repeated calls, the last two being on 8/17/10 and 9/9/10, the only response I received is that they are going to put in a request for me to get the card issued. The CSR I spoke to on 9/9/10 said he was also putting in a request until I told him that I was checking the status as this was done previously. I would like to receive my $200 Visa Gift Card owed to me due to the promotion offered at the time. In addition, the name and number Comcast representatives provide for the company that sends out the promotion items is unresponsive and no live person picks up after being on hold for over 30 minutes or more. On several occasions, this has happened.Economically, in these times, I would like the money owed to me per their promotion. I am a paying customer and would like what’s due to me in return as promised."
1,"It is not one issue that is causing me to write this. It is every single call I had with Comcast that has caused me elevated blood pressure and unresolved request. My average hold time plus transfers is about 5-6 hours per issue (by the way, Comcast does not believe in taking notes, issuing confirmation numbers or caring in general). Now, I understand that I do ask hard question and special training is needed for special employees at Comcast. My questions range from ""when can I expect technician to come over?"", ""I need to transfer my service"" or ""Can your service please work, given that I am paying you for it?"". Tough I know! Sometimes, I get to speak to someone who knows what is going on and I am kind of thrown off guard with their level of knowledge. But the rep right after him reminds me how special most of Comcast is. Majority of the calls begin with 20-minute research of who I am (the fact that I provided my customer number that is on the bill does not help and they are even more confused to see that my phone number starts with 512 Austin, TX but I live in Washington, DC). To reference Jeopardy, ""What is cell phone area code?"". So then they want to transfer me to Texas call center, even though Austin doesn't even have Comcast.The latest thing was trying to get a tech to come out and install services at my new place. He was going to be there between 2-5. I was fine with this, but should have known that my instructions would confuse things further. I told the rep on the phone, ""I will be downstairs at the business center of my apartment building. Please have your tech call my cell when he arrives and I will meet him upstairs"". ""No problem, sir"". Around 2:30PM, I walked upstairs clearly thinking ""there is no way that Comcast's system could be so sophisticated that the tech received the message or understood instructions!"". Sure enough, he was apparently already there and left a copy of his work order. Oh boy, which level of ** will I have to go through now to get this resolved? It wasn't too bad. I talked to their escalation department who told me that the dispatcher will call me back in 15 minutes. 45 minutes later, I called back and told them ""still nothing"", only to have this ""escalation rep"" tell me that he saw the notes that the tech will not be able to make it back and that we will have to reschedule. I am wondering, who would have rescheduled the install since even this ""escalation"" rep was surprised that nobody gave me a call to inform me of their inability to do anything right? In addition, the escalation rep was more interested in arguing with me than providing service. Luckily, I asked to speak to his supervisor and I should get a callback from the supervisor within 48 hours (yes, escalation's team supervisor is on a 48-hour SLA). I would love to be able to go to a different company, unfortunately, Comcast is the only thing available in DC. I can't wait for FIOS to be available. If there is any class action lawsuits against Comcast that could fit my issues, please let me know! I am not getting the quality of services I am paying for."
1,"Comcast prices have gotten so ridiculous that I went down there, to lower my package. I have basic now with something called digital economy. That, plus internet, is still just under $100 a month. Anyway, I have a HD DVR in my living room, and returned the DVR from my bedroom. Well, with the new Xfinity, my bedroom TV  now only gets like 15 channels, and most of them are local access. I feel if I am paying for a particular channel. I should get that channel on all TVs in the house.  Well, in order to get the channels I subscribe to in the bedroom, I would have to upgrade to the next highest package, which is an additional $30 per month. Also, channels like TNT, TBS, and others used to be part of the basic package, or expanded basic, which they no longer offer.  So I have lost these channels altogether. The satellite companies offer these in their basic package.  I could go on, and on, but what is the point.  I am a single income family that cannot afford a social life, so TV and internet is all I have, and they have made it unaffordable to the average person."
1,They have a lousy service and the clicker doesn’t work right. They told me the program wasn’t right for me and they are the ones who programmed the clicker. It is a big headache! I am dropping Comcast. End of the story.
1,I just want to tell anybody who can read this: Do not use Comcast cable TV service. I cannot get a human to report the signal lost after several tries. I do not have signal for 2 weeks. Every time I was told they are busy and to call later. They even did not offer me a chance to wait.
1,"I have contacted Comcast several times about a safety issue concerning the cable wire left on the side walk and in the grass area. The children are tripping over the wire and the splitters were left open. All we want is for the wire to be buried. My grandchild fell and hit his head on the step, others have hurt themselves also."
1,"Comcast is the biggest mistake you will ever make. Service is beyond the worst in the industry. Their SLA's actually state that your satisfaction is not guaranteed and they are not responsible for any, yes, any problems and that they are not required to fix them. I live in Atlanta and if you aren't facing the right direction, Comcast is the only option. Their programming is by far the worst available and prices are by far the highest at $95.75/month versus twice the HD and channel options from Dish or DTV at $59.99 to include Sunday NFL ticket, all movie channels and all sports programming. Comcast is rated 15th out of 16 TV service providers in the country and number 16 is Charter, the same company, just a different name, different region. The problem is, they are all that's avail if you don't have a view of the south sky. Comcast should lock the doors and turn in the keys and walk away. I understand they have millions of customers so many complaints will be had but in a survey Comcast has lower than 38% customer satisfaction. DTV has 92% and DISH 74%."
1,"I called Comcast on Friday. They said they would be here to repair a problem between 12 noon and 4 PM on Monday. Monday came. They did not. Called and they said, they could be here on Tuesday between noon and 4 PM. Tuesday came. They did not. It's now Wednesday. They called this morning to say they would be here today between noon and 4 PM. It's now 4:13 PM. I'm on hold with them and they now say they will be here tomorrow between noon and 4 PM. Of course ""tomorrow"" never comes."
1,"I tried to discontinue my service and they continue to charge me monthly as they say I have equipment. I turned in the box in June or July of 2008 before hurricane Ike. The box was lost at their Galveston facility. I have been charged for the box at $7 a month since then, and I cannot get them to refund my money and disconnect my service."
1,Comcast has intentionally coded when online to not confirm payments when system is dial up so they can charge an $2 per payment. They get a percentage of this extra money. They have now returned four mailed in checks and are forcing my payment to be higher than normal. My account is local with Chase and their return is no account in existence. Account # is xxxxx. They have disconnected in my past and does not accept online payment. 
1,"On the 12th of August Comcast came to my home to repair damage done during a storm. On our next bill, they charged me $28.99 for a trouble call. We called customer service and informed them we had the service protect plan. They agreed and told us they would give us credit on the next bill. We were expected to pay the entire bill with the charge for the service call. I told their customer service rep this was not right. I should have my bill adjusted immediately and not wait until the next billing cycle. I am sure we are not the only customer that received an adjustment in this manner. I should not be penalized because of Comcast's accounting system. "
1,"The nightmare started in March of this year 2010. I couldn't watch cable TV and here I am paying for it. I wasn't getting any picture except colored lines. In April, a technician came out and we were told that there was no reception coming into the lines. Before the technician came out I had called Comcast several times in March and they had me resetting my cable box, they reset it from their end. When they set an appointment they told me that there would be no charge for the service and they were going to adjust my bill. This is actually when the nightmare started I received my bill and I was being charged with the technician service and my service had never been adjusted. I called Comcast and they quickly apologized and said that they would fix the bill and I would see it on the next statement. The next statement came and yes, the technicians service was credited but the service had not been adjusted. I called Comcast again and again they apologized and said I would see the adjustments on the next bill never happened. I went down to the Comcast payment center with my statement and I was told after about half hour that this is what they will do for me. The CSR put the dollar amount on the bottom which was I think 37. and I went to pay it that Friday. Never looking at the receipt because I thought this lady was really trying to help me and be honest. That night when I got home my wife was looking at the receipt and she blew her lid. This receipt reflected the bill that we had received when the technician came out. So, according to this bill we owed $329. Called Comcast and they told, ""Oh, don't worry about it. If the statement is printed out before you make a payment it won't show up on the statement."" We have resorted to going directly to the payment center but sad to say not all the information is making it into the system. What they tell me in person doesn't even get noted in the computer. Last month I was told if I paid $63 on Friday I would be all caught up and would not owe anything until Sept. I get the bill and it states I owe over 200. "
1,I ordered cable and internet and was assured the price would be a total of $59.99 on the first bill. Then I get a bill for $174.96. I called their office and I was left on hold for over an hour to speak to a manager and they never came to the phone to address this fraudulent bill.
1,"Ever since Comcast changed its service to HDTV we have experienced intermittent interference that comes with disruption in the sound and picture tiling. It happens more frequently at night than daytime. When it happens, it is on all channels and DVR recordings. When this first started, I made a call to report and the whole system was reset. The second time I called again, they did a reset. The third time I called, they finally scheduled a tech to come out. Four days later one actually showed up. He put down a new interior cable cord. The 5th time I called again, they did a reset and scheduled another tech. Three days later, he came. This time the tech swapped out the receiver-DVR unit and made some kind of adjustments outside but said he felt good about what had been done to clear the problem. So now over three weeks from the first phone call, on the 6th phone call, again they would need to send out another tech. This time the tech was quite savvy. He found that a second cable line to one of the bedrooms in the house (we had basic cable set up for the bedroom TV) was picking up radio signals in the area! So his answer was to disconnect all other cable runs and have live the one main cable. I was not happy with this supposed solution. After 20 years of having the same exact cable lines that have worked fairly well, now the whole answer to solving this mystery was to disable every cable line but the main one. Does this really make any logical sense? Well so much for that theory anyway. The problem started up again that very evening! Reception was good for a couple of hours this time. So call #7. This time they were suppose to order a ""field line-supervisor"" to be dispatched. Three more days pass and we get another ordinary tech, again! Oh, but this tech was even more insightful than any of the other five. First thing he asked after being shown just what has been happening, his first question, ""Did anyone happen to have a hair dryer on at the time of the problem?"" A what? I was getting a bit cranky at this point so I left the room and let my husband take over. Whatever the guy did, he did it outside! (Without the aid of testing the problem against a hair dryer!)Oh, but the problem still was not fixed! To this point we have had seven different techs out, reset after reset and no supervisor yet to speak of! So now it is Sunday morning Aug 22nd and when I turned on the TV at 7am I got total scramble on every single channel. We called again and this time left a blistering message about getting this fixed! So on Tuesday am, support said that a line-supervisor would be contacting us later that day after they came out to try one more time to determine what the problem is. Again I stayed at home waiting for someone to come out like I was told to do. The whole day came and went. Nothing! I was fed up with this runaround so my husband called again at about 8pm on Tuesday August 24th. Oh, they did come out and made some adjustments to the outside line. ""Are you still having problems? "" Yep, we sure are! If they came out why did they not do us the curtsey of knocking on the door or having the Supervisor call at least (like we were told they would)? ""Oh, well they must have tried but was likely no one was home."" This was an out-n-out lie! I was home, plus two other adults.I have a very noisy dog that would definitely alert us to the presence of someone around the house, plus we have never heard from a Supervisor at all. When my husband made to call Tuesday evening the best the gal could tell us was that she could have another tech out on Friday. I have had enough of Comcast, the run around and the blatant poor service ability is appalling. so Comcast listen up you are not the only game in town now! And after 20 years we are taking our business somewhere else! The economic impact is with the loss of time to me and my business. I own a business myself and I charge $45/hour for my services so with the number of hours I have spent wasted waiting around for another technician is about $900 (20 hours at $45 per hr.) not to mention paying $83 a month for the last three months for lousy TV viewing. So all told, I say for my time and frustration and loss of service $1,500 is a fair basis to pay me to make this fiasco go away. I would have to be closing my business doors and walk away if I treated my clientele with such callous indifference to a service issue as Comcast has demonstrated towards me and my family."
1,"I received my bill in August on September and noticed that it was $25 more than usual.  Comcast decided to back bill me for a box I do not have!  Their 2 service reps took it when I had a DV-R installed last November.  They apparently never logged it in and told me it's missing. They sent a service representative to my home to search for it and take numbers of all the boxes I do have.  It has been 10 days now and they are still looking.  They told me that if they didn't find it, I would continue to be billed.  This is nuts. I suppose their service guys are boy scouts and I, the customer, am a crook who hoards little black boxes.  They are going to bill me late charges if I don't pay in full by next Tuesday."
1,"Comcast door-to-door sales man promises everything we have now w/ DirecTV at a savings of $25 a month. We sign up. First bill comes showing charges we were told were free or, included. We were charged $100 installation (we were told there was free installation and only a $10 activation fee) and a fee for HD DVR. We were told this was included. We already had this service with DirecTV. Why would we switch to pay more? I fax in the order receipt and get a phone call telling me that the prices are set and basically too bad! So it looks like even a receipt with all services at an agreed upon price still isn't enough for Comcast. Beware of the door-to-door cable salesman from Comcast!"
1,"I was a 10 year customer of Comcast with a total of over $7,200 spent on their services. I recently terminated my service because of a home move. I was out of town for over a month. When I returned, I discovered a notice from a collection agency for final charges of $104 on my account. No doubt I was late on my payment, but I did not appreciate Comcast turning my account over to a collection agency. If I was that bad a customer, how would they have put up with me for 10 years. Buyer beware!"
1,"Many years ago, we filed a complaint against Suburban Cable (now owned by Comcast) to remove their ""ugly"" box off our property/easement. We came home one day to find it on our property, without our permission. From our original title, the easement was only for Peco. But the cable company claimed that they had permission from Peco. I called Peco and they claimed that was untrue, since it was our property and the original rights gave access only to Peco. Then the cable company claimed to be a utility with rights. I called the utility commission in Harrisburg, which claimed it was untrue. They were not a utility (just a TV cable company at the time).The main reason we wanted them off our property was because they were constantly digging. Every time there was a problem with someone hooked to this box on our property, they seem to need to dig up ours as well. Our property has become like a vending machine, now for Comcast. The digging continued over the years and I had a complaint with the consumer protection in Philadelphia, plus Better Business. Comcast never reached out to ever resolve this problem. I found their customer service simply terrible. There is a township building several properties over in which they could move their box to, but to no avail. Today, 8/25/10, they continued digging on our property again because someone else was having a problem. They dug between two mature bushes which left me concerned about root damage. I find their approach like ""bullies"" who show no respect or care to the property owner. Never have they spoken with me prior to digging about my concerns. When I told them that there was an outstanding complaint against Comcast and to stop digging and leave, they rudely refused. "
1,"I received an advertisement for a bundle service package of $99.00 plus tax for the 1st year. Prior to ordering, I chatted online with a representative to determine all fees associated with the services, ask for any additional charges, like rental of boxes, remotes, etc. I was told that it's a flat rate of $99 plus tax. He also told me that the installation would be approximately $45. I asked again stating that my monthly charge will be approximately $99 plus NJ taxes. Bill came at it was over $250. I complained, they stated that installation and adding services were two different charges, but they would make sure it was only $45. However, they stated that since I chose to bundle my services, I don't have to pay charges for a remote, or digital box, as it included, but the modem is an additional $6 a month unless I bought it. However, when asked about the chat communication that I had saved and the advertisement, it clearly states, all charges are included but tax. There was no response. This month, I received a bill for an HD TV, again a service I never asked for."
1,I have attempted repeatedly to cancel my Comcast account. Comcast requires that I call a customer service number which is constantly busy during office hours. There is no other published mechanism for canceling an account. It appears that the only option open to me is to stop paying my bill. I expect Comcast will continue my account until the bill is substantial then turn it over to a collection agency.
1,"I have been without cable for 2 1/2 weeks and Comcast made two appointments with me to remedy the situation and the Technician did not show up twice. I called Comcast on the 17th of August when the appointment was set for, and they assured me that a technician would be out to fix the cable. At 9pm on August 17, 2010, the technician had not shown up as of yet, so I called Comcast and received their Call Center and was told the appointment was rescheduled until August 19, 2010 for no apparent reason at all. Not to mention that no one from Comcast called me to inform me that the appointment had been rescheduled after I made myself available to accommodate the appointment. The Call Center told me that the appointment had been rescheduled for August 19, 2010 and that I did not need to be home for the appointment since the lines were down, all the technician needed is access to the back gate, which I left unlocked. Today is August 19, 2010, and I called Comcast to find out what time the technician was coming out, and the representative told me that the technician would be out between the hours of 2 pm and 5 pm. It is now 9:42 PM and no technician has shown up nor did they call. I called Comcast at 5 PM to let them know that a technician has still not come to my home to fix the problem and they informed me that the technician was running late but he would definitely be out this evening to fix the problem. To no avail, no technician. I am very upset and displeased with Comcast customer service. I have been a loyal customer for 16 years not to mention that I have paid for the services that I'm not receiving. Please help me remedy this problem as I feel that unprofessionalism is being displayed by Comcast not to mention that I feel disregarded and disrespected. Please help me resolve this problem. "
1,"Beware of Comcast, too big for good policies and service.Installation was horrible and took 2 months, 6 visits, overcharged for them to get service going. After 3 years, when disconnecting on 8/9/2010, they still charge for a full month on the final bill and then prefer to send a check for the service you did not use, which takes up to 5+ weeks! Why overcharge for something you did not receive in the first place?! Horrible process."
1,"I received a call several weeks ago from a Comcast telemarketer who offered me a ""deal"" for services I was not receiving.  He said that I would also get faster Internet service if I were to accept the deal.  Internet service is internet service--I can't understand why they were claiming that they can increase the speed.  That's ridiculous.  It makes me feel that they are holding out on me.I received a new Comcast bill and did not understand why I needed to pay more and exactly what I was paying for.  The young woman I spoke with was hard to understand--because the English was not that good and because she did not seem to understand the price structure.  She sent me to the Web site.  I navigated to that and had to put in my address and zip code to see prices, which makes me think that people are offered different prices depending on I really don't know what.So I saw that they are offering an incredible deal to new customers.  The cost of which (for the same services I get now) is half of what I pay.  There is a contract involved but the great pricing can last up to two years.  This is blatantly not fair.  That is like me going into a grocery store and paying a different price based on something like my hair color.  Service costs should be the same across the board."
1,"We are a small real estate business. We are unable to connect a tenant to Comcast, because they want to do upgrades here first. The previous tenant has service, but they refused to transfer this existing service without a construction upgrade. I am losing this tenant as a result. A small thing that turned into a big thing. They will not even return our calls."
1,"Comcast has a feed cable running across the entry of my property. The wire hangs so low, you can touch with your hand. I have been calling them since mid June. I have not been successful in getting a resolution. Currently, I have a motor-home that has been stationary for 2 months, because I cannot drive under the wire. They have promised to repair 8 different times, but never show up. This is a safety risk for my family and friends."
1,"There was never any discussion as to the installation charges that would take place on this account. I was charged $25 for internet, $25 for cable, $25 for phone (which ended up waived), $8 to hook up other boxes (2 basic), plus activation fees. This was a bundle. I could have hooked it up and not paid this ridiculous amount. If I'm paying the tech, everything Comcast gets from the bill is profit? Wow! I'm in the wrong business. Not only did they charge me the fees, the service was to start on Saturday, August 7th. After everything was connected and the tech left, the phone was so fuzzy I couldn't use it. I called the tech back, who left 3 pieces of equipment, and he said he would come back to check it. He called me 3 times to say he was on his way. I left soccer practice, once for each of my girls, to meet him. He never showed up. He finally arrived at 9:30 pm to tell me the phone didn't work! Duh! He said the box was bad? He couldn't fix it until Wednesday. As I left for a game, at 8:15 PM, he was pulling in to fix it. I got a bill Thursday for service and installation. Great customer service! I just got charged for services I didn't have and I still have fewer channels than with DirecTV. There are very few kids channels. I regret ever trying Comcast and am, unfortunately, stuck with it for right now. Pathetic! "
1,"Last july 27, 2010, I called the 1800-Comcast # and of course, the usual introduction been played, like this is recorded for training or whatever purposes. I spoke with customer representative, since my one year subscription for preferred package will expire anytime August. I asked if they have a promotional package wherein I can avail once my old program package expires. This guy named Ira a call center from Mexico. He said he put me in bundle with telephone (unlimited) and cable for $69.99 per month plus tax. I asked about the installation fee and etc. He told me that everything will be waived and assured me that there is no hidden charges when I get my cable bill.Today, August 12, 2010 I receive my bill and Comcast charged me $194.60. I was so shock and *** off and the bottom line is when I called Comcast customer reps, 2 times, they told me such bundle/package is non-existence and they can't pull-out the conversation with the guy, call center in Mexico. They ripped us, mislead us with their promotion and bottom line is we have to call them many, many times to solve this problem and put on hold for how many hours.They told me that a supervisor will call within an hour but nothing happens. Everyone be aware of Comcast scams, to attract more customer. I was so clear in my conversation with the customer reps about the price of the bundle. I repeated it many times back to him and now he doesn't exist. I was talking to a ghost call center in Mexico. They can't trace it. Help anybody. What shall I do? Sue comcast? Is there any agency that oversee this kind of scam?"
1,"Each month for a solid year I had to call after receiving a statement to complain that it was not the price quoted to me. Then a mysterious charge of $15 appeared in the fall of 2009 and after complaining to the Michigan Public Service Commission the company employee said it would be credited which it never was. I cancelled in February 2010. I received a letter stating that I owed $37.01 for partial service in February and that same $15.00 for a total of $52.99. I wrote back that I was including a check for the $37.01 but ""hell would freeze before I paid that $15.00"" because I didn't owe it. They called a month later and said that wasn't good enough and I said that was all they were going to get. So now they still have my check for $37.01 and they have me in collections for $52.99. "
1,"We placed an order for cable TV, phone and Internet service over a month ago. The technician came to the house as scheduled and we were advised that due to a storm in the area a month prior, that service could not be set up. The technician supposedly called for someone to install new wiring at the street, which never happened. The appointment was rescheduled and another technician said the same thing. Once again the wiring was not run from the street. Today there’s yet another scheduled installation. This time we were advised that because of no wiring from the street, the wiring would have to be ran underground and new outlets installed which would cost $90.00. I have had to schedule the day off on several occasions and work on weekends as a result.I feel that this is poor customer service on the part of Comcast as I work from home and it’s a great inconvenience for me to have to adjust my work schedule as a result of the conflicting and inaccurate information we have received regarding installation."
1,"The service technician cut multiple building cables, removed a 4 to 5 ft piece of each cable during installation of service in a neighbor's unit. It disrupted service to 2 of 3 units in a 4-unit townhouse building. Another technician repaired two of three cables but refused to replace the third. I want the cable repaired. It's part of the building wiring. I am a long time customer who they do not seem to care about. I've got nothing but the run-around from Comcast support people. I waited all day for the technician since half of the work had to be performed in my unit. And then he refused to repair the cable to my unit. Without satisfactory resolution to this problem, I will initiate a police report against Comcast for willful destruction of property. I will call the States Attorney office after speaking to my lawyer. I will call the BBB and the local radio and newspaper offices and raise the level of attention concerning field technicians’ behavior and lack of customer service/satisfaction. The service technician seem to be putting customers in the middle of their ****  contest with Verizon. It does not appear to me to be a very smart thing to do. Facility wiring was destroyed. It was done in such a way that it is difficult to repair without access to multiple units."
1,"June 1, 2010, Comcast cable offered a special for a starter pack that included channels (86 and 235) that are no longer available, due to the changes of channels in the package. I have, from the time, been viewing channels especially, 86 and 235.  I was told that the network changed, and that they are no longer available in my package.  My complaint is that I paid for these channels in the beginning, and should continue receiving them until the 12 months have expired, or the price should be decreased, since it is no longer available for package.  Spoke with Mr. **, and he explained that it was available for my package at the time, and that the network had upgraded it to another package, and that I can get it for an additional $10.  This is unfair business as if it was set-up for me to enjoy such channels, and then take it away, for me to pay more for what I already had. The gentleman refused to give me back the channels I originally had. This is preposterous. Please help resolve this scheme of Comcast cable. Comcast is asking for more money for services, that was already a part of a package deal, and suddenly they take several channels away, from the original offer, to get more for what it was originally offered for."
1,"I have been a subscriber of Comcast Digital Television service for several years. I recently noticed that our 900 series HD channels have been replaced with audio music selections. In the past, similar situations have occurred such as an unexplained loss of a local TV guide reference Channel and more recently the loss of several channels completely. The only constant from the consumer's point of view is that selections are reduced and prices are increased. Comcast seems to be doing a ‘bait and switch’ routine over a long enough period of time that consumers tend to go unnoticed. It's like a slowly evolving scam. They seem to have a monopoly on cable service so we endure this outrage. I don't understand how they can continue to get away with this."
1,"I have been a customer with Comcast for over 10 years. I pay for high speed internet which is a joke. They charge top prices and have a junk product. I have to call them every other day because my internet never works. How can nothing be done about this? Wait time to talk to someone who can never help is 10 + minutes. So with that being said, I know I am not the only one. We have service tech's from Comcast out to our house at least once a week. When they come out service will work for a few hours then it's back down again! I am a real estate agent with a home office and can never use my internet. This cost me deals and is very upsetting."
1,"Over the course of the last 2 years, I have had Comcast technicians out to my house no less than 13 times for interrupted TV service, slow internet and dropping internet. I have called no less than 20 times to complain. I have paid $150 a month for this TV and internet service that is sub-par. I have the slow internet connections documented from Speedtest.net to validate my issues.$150 a month for this service. I see where Comcast has settled a class action suit which got each consumer $16. You have to be kidding me. I subscribe to a service which cost me $150 a month and get $16 back in a class action suit! This is a joke. I want a year of what I paid back for services not received as promised at least $1500.00"
1,"My initial Bill at $151.00 and there has been no additional changes in standard Cable, telephone and internet is from AOL not Comcast. My bill is now $173! This increase has been ongoing for the past year, from $135 average to $173 this month for July. This company continues to increase by small amounts until, - additions or excuses. How long will the public be abused by this company before people take action this results in unreasonable income expenditure, denying me [soon to go to High school] on a monthly basis. My co-worker, same age, in a predominantly community of upper mid-class Caucasians citizens pay $121 per month with no increases or sundry additional charges. It is the consensus in my community that Comcast is a racket, as in Racketeering this product to families."
1,"I contacted to Comcast to upgrade my service (add telephone and cable service to my internet for the ""Triple Play"" package) $159.99 for 1st 12 months then $174.99 for the next 12 months then $199.99 a month after promotion. This only includes service for 1 room. You will have to rent an additional box for $9.99 a month for 80 channels but does not include HD service or rent an adapter for regular digital TV. I feel this is a rip off. The rep I spoke with was rude and had a very smart attitude. Then I called back to inquire about my current internet speeds and why the price I am paying is not listed anywhere on the site. I currently pay $59.99 a month for what they call Performance internet, 2 MBS download and 10 MBS uploads so I was told. Well they currently have a special for $19.99 for 6 months after which the regular price will be $42.99. I asked the rep why my service was $59.99 if according to the internet the regular price is $42.99 and she told me everyone pays $59.99. When I told her that's not what it says she said that was for new customers only. I do not understand that logic, if the regular price is $42.99 that is what it should be for all customers new or old. She too was very rude. If I had another option for high speed internet in my area I would drop Comcast but am only limited to their service until other options such as FIOS is available."
1,"We pay about $45 a month for internet and together with my cable, the bill comes out to about $150 a month. During the month of July, the internet would not work in the afternoon. We called and they said the problem was a power shortage but for a whole month? I don't believe it. Almost every week, something is always wrong with the cable or internet. Right now, our on-demand does not work, typical. We pay for the service so we should get the service they promised. Right now, it seems as if we are paying a month of service just to only have about two weeks of actual good, legitimate service. Recently, we checked our bill and every time we called them (which was a lot) to fix a problem, they charged us. Yes, I know it's only cents that they charge but with all the problems that this company has, it adds up. All I want is decent cable and internet that I can rely on. "
1,"In February, I made a payment to Comcast by bill pay with the bank. Comcast sent the money back to the bank saying the account did not exist. Now it is the end of July and they wanted $413.99. My basic bill is $93.15 plus added fees. The following is what I paid through April. On 07/15/10, I paid $200.00, which after receiving, they suspended my service because they wanted $299.06. On 07/31/09, I sent $99.06. Everything was restored except the phone which might take up to 3 days, and they are going to add reconnection fee to bill. This error was Comcast’s fault. Had they not sent the bill back, this never would have happened. But they refused to listen to my side of the complaint. I am very dissatisfied with them. "
1,"I ordered and the internet through Comcast with self set up kit. After several weeks it never came, I called customer service and got someone I could barely understand who put me on hold for 15 minutes before I was cut off. I just got a bill for almost $200 for a service I have not only ever used; I never even got the start up kit to install in the first place! I called customer service today and was on hold between 2 different operators for no less than 33 minutes according to my call timers before I spoke to a supervisor. As with the reps the supervisor had limited ability to understand English! This is the worst customer service department I have ever dealt with even the IRS! I canceled my service and went to direct TV which appears to have English speaking reps. My bill was adjusted after almost an hour with these people telling me I have a service I don't Have completely unreal! Very upset with all this out sourcing. Bring our companies back home!"
1,"I have repeated problems with cable TV hookups, equipment replacement and function and internet signal strength (routers). Different stories given by different technicians on-site. They fail to return phone calls. Overall, service is pathetic."
1,"I have been having problems with my phone and cable service.  I’m not getting a signal.  I scheduled an appointment for 07/26/10 at 4:00 pm-6:00 pm.  The staff showed at 7:00 pm after I took time of my employment to be there at home.  The technical support staff reported, ""I don’t have the cable I need.""  The staff was not prepared to work on my cable issues.  The staff only took less than 15 minutes then asked me to reschedule.  Due to my busy schedule, I cannot have anyone come to complete repairs until 07/31/10.  I am upset that I have been without cable for a week because your staff is not prepared.  I took time off my employment.  I have not had cable for a week."
1,"We recently became customers of Comcast. We scheduled installation (it took two weeks to get an appointment). We selected Comcast because we wanted cable, phone and internet. I liked that the plan allowed for caller ID on the TV. The first person came out and caller ID never worked. I called and was told to call back in 3 days. Great, now I have to wait 3 days. It still does not work and I am going through the long wait time to speak to a representative. I wait another week to have a representative come and install a ""new"" box with the proper features. Pardon me, but why did they not install the most up to date, new equipment the first time?Okay, now the ""new"" equipment is installed. The tech said to wait one hour. Well, I waited 3 and it is still not working. I call the call center and speak to Eurika, she runs me through all the checks. All seems to be in working order to them but I'm still not getting the paid service with caller ID. As I inspect the ""new"" equipment I see it is dented, scratched and obviously have been very well used. I call back and am told I should take the equipment to the local Comcast center to exchange it if I don't like it. Oh, and by the way, there will be an installation fee. They ""waived"" the second installation fee. As a reminder, I am a new customer. I have had the service less than 30 days. I would like this reported to the proper agency. I'm sure I'm not the only person they are taking advantage of."
1,"The flipping digital box doesn't work. It won't program, and I am sick of the 22 other channels that they let me get. I tried 6 times to call and program the box and all it gives me is channel 1234 of one moment please."
1,"Me and my fiance placed an order with Comcast and 6 times, they did not show. Every time I call to see if they are in fact coming or if they are running late, they have assured me that they would be there. They have my cell number and job, also my fiance's number. I have lost time and pay from my job due to this situation. Well, I have no physical damage. However, I do have (I guess you can say) mental anguish. I am very disappointed and angry about the so-called service I was supposed to receive."
1,"I have called Comcast for a week to take the cable out of my yard. I am not a customer and the cable is not connected to my home. It is attached to the neighbor's house. I have explained to them that we are trying to obtain a license for this property to move our family daycare. Each day I call, I hold on while they go somewhere. I wait and they come back to tell me they are coming out that day. Sometimes when I have held so long, I am disconnected. My granddaughter comes over and she cannot go and play in her backyard because of that cable."
1,"We ordered Comcast Cable last month.  The install date was Saturday, July 24th.  Today is Monday, July 26th.  The tech arrived to our house at 9:00 am.  We had a 7 am to 10 am window of service.  The tech attempted to install the cable service and received error messages on all of the cable boxes.  He told us that he would have to leave and come back with his supervisor.  Prior to leaving, he disconnected our Direct TV service and disconnected all of our satellite boxes.  He left the three cable boxes in various conditions throughout the house - meaning wrappers and remotes and cables were hanging out everywhere.  We waited until 7:00 pm for his return.  He did not return nor did we receive a call from anyone at Comcast.  We started calling Comcast on Sunday and spoke with several call agents.  Each agent was saying, ""We show that you have service and your cable was installed.""  This could not be further from the truth.  As of today, Monday July 26th, we still do not have service and our satellite is disconnected.  However, we are still paying for our satellite.  I hope we will not be billed for cable that we do not have.  We made several calls today to various 800 numbers.  We could not get anyone to see us until Tuesday from 7 am to 10 am.  Now I have to take a vacation day to meet with a tech who may or may not be able to correct the problem."
1,"On June 26, 2010 at 11:00 am, a Comcast Cable employee came to my residence.  It was for a scheduled appointment to pick up my two cable boxes, two remotes, wireless modem, and router due to me canceling my service secondary to moving out of state.  On July 24, 2010, I received a letter in the mail at my new address from Comcast informing me that I never returned my ""modem equipment"" and that I may owe ""$500"".  I called Comcast Cable to find out why this was happening and all they could tell me was to call collections.  I believe that I am being taken advantage of.  My mother was present and helping me move that day and was there at the time of pickup.  She is a witness that the Comcast employer indeed took all of the Comcast equipment.  I am a responsible Comcast customer who has always paid her bills on time and they have been unwilling to help me resolve this issue.  I have not stolen their property and I am hoping by going through this medium that someone can help me resolve this.  "
1,"My boyfriend has Comcast and I live with him for many years. We agreed to disconnect it due to his extenuating circumstances and he does not to deal with it. I went to Comcast store and also called to disconnect. They ignored me simply because I was not on the account. They don't understand that I am member of household and pay the bills including Comcast. They were rude, inconsiderate and horrible customer service. Should I accept that from I company that I paid services for? I also reported that there is no cable services. It went out on me. They even didn't care to take a look at the problem and send a technician. I also returned the cable box to their store. They insisted that they will keep charging for the overpriced cable just because I am not on the account. Can they understand that is no thank you for bad customer service and Comcast disregard for the customer that pays for a service that I am not satisfied with?"
1,"This is a copy of the email I sent to Comcast - using their email form.""Upon agreement between myself and the customer representative that there was something wrong with the recording/playback part of the, We set up an appointment for today (Wed - 21 July) to replace the cable box. The tech brought a cable box that was rather beat up and an older model than the one I already have and he suggested I would be better off going to the walk-in station in North Scituate and getting one myself. He didn't offer to come back tomorrow with at least a matching cable box or better than the one being replaced.When I called Comcast after the tech left to explain that I was not satisfied with the way this was being handled, I was told that my service call had been listed as 'Canceled. ' I then asked if I could at least call the walk-in facility in North Scituate to be sure they had a unit available, she said that she couldn't give out that number (and that even she couldn't call this Comcast facility - it was against the rules).Is this the kind of treatment a customer should expect for the $150+ I pay every month for the three services I subscribe to from Comcast.? """
1,I keep calling this company all the time. I cut the service over two months ago because the tech the company send me to install the phone service cut my air antenna to used on the confection. I call and call Comcast to send somebody to repair the damage they do and never send me anyone. That is why I have to cut my phone service with this company. Customer service is poor. They never return my phone calls and now I still getting phone bills. They tell me I still have phone service. We have to do something about this company who robs people. 
1,"I had been losing my internet connection with increasing frequency over a seven week period. I finally contacted Comcast on 7/15/10. I went through their tedious menu options before reaching a person and one of the last questions asked was whether or not I would be interested in participating in a satisfaction survey at the end of my call. I responded affirmatively and immediately lost my connection and had to re-dial. The rep that I finally spoke with literally oozed indifference. I actually felt like I was imposing on her. I explained the problem and she said the soonest she could have a service person visit was 7/20/10 sometime between 9:30 and 12:30. I reluctantly agreed.After stewing for a bit I called again and spoke to another rep, who again, treated me like an annoyance. I explained that 5 days was a long time to be without service and she said that was the best Comcast could do, take it or leave it. When I described the problem I was having, she suggested I purchase a new modem and try that. I purchased a new modem and went through the byzantine registration process with Comcast only to find that I still didn't have an internet connection. I called back a final time and said that I would wait for the service rep, but expected a discount on my bill. I was given the standard $10.00 off my monthly bill.The service rep arrived shortly after noon on 7/20/10 and, hopefully, repaired the problem. So far, so good. Comcast shares a monopoly with AT&T and both companies stink. They seem to be under the impression that we are still living in 1990 when people didn't rely on their computers daily for everything from airline reservations to bill paying. Your problem is not their problem and the knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathers that they have answering phones remind you of that with every contact. I would love to see the government take over both companies, because they certainly couldn't do any worse."
1,"I have been trying to get a hold of Comcast via their phone numbers all day today and I have received a busy signal or a ""cannot complete this call"" error every time."
1,"I downgraded from Digital Starter package, as it was way too expensive, and went back to Basic Cable service. I was still overcharged.  I called again and wanted to cancel my TV service, but they sent me to Customer Retentions, who promised me the service I was previously quoted for Digital Starter would be honored, so I was happy, and agreed.  At the same time, I was quoted a 1-year lock-in at $33 per month for my high-speed internet. 6 months later, Comcast jacked the price up to nearly double.I called again, and they argued with me, telling me that the deal they gave me was not possible. I again pulled the plug on my TV service. Again, I was directed to Retentions, and Anna, the rep, guaranteed me a fixed rate of $61.37 per month for the next 6 months for Digital Starter TV plus internet. The next bill arrived in the amount of $107!  I called again, furious at being constantly lied to, but this time they refused to honor their own agreement, so I canceled the TV service and had them prove I still get internet for $33/month with no modem rental. At this point, I will refuse to ever pay anything higher. They are way overpriced, and do not offer individual TV stations, only their ridiculous ""package deals"", where you get to buy stations you will never watch, at a very high price. They do not honor their promises to you. Their billing department is destroying them. I hope they sink, and fast! With FiOS becoming available, I will switch over in a heartbeat.Comcast can rot in their own created sewer. People, do not ever subscribe to Comcast's inferior products and services. You will be robbed and cheated! I have no other experienced consequences, other than the effect they have on my bank account. "
1,"My cable bill was due and was going to be shut off. I received a call from a representative for Comcast who wanted to see if I could make a payment to prevent the cable from being shut off. I said I did not get paid till the 15th and will call and make a payment then. The representative said he wanted to save me from paying reconnect fees and stated I could make a payment arrangement through my checking account. Just to choose a date and Comcast would take it out then and if I needed an extension to call them two days prior to the date. I agreed and setup a payment for the 15th of July and he gave me a confirmation number and a guarantee. The next day I get a notice that my account is overdrawn. Comcast took out the payment the same day. I immediately called Comcast who states they won't do anything since it’s not their policy to take post dated checks and the employee who told me so would be disciplined. They would not refund my checking account, the overdrafts fees or even send a letter to my bank but they would credit my Comcast account. My account is completely overdrawn and all the bills I had setup to go through have been returned with fees. These bills would have gone through had it not been for Comcast."
1,"Sales reps came to the door and I spent an hour with them understanding and making sure that I would have a better deal than with Verizon. They quoted me (in writing) $65 a month. Within three months, my bill was at almost 3 times as much, over my original Verizon bill. The also did not wire my house correct either, which was an irritation but after my bill went through the roof, it really made me mad. I have had Comcast in WA for over 10 years with no problems. Here, nothing but problems. They have over 150 complaints with the Attorney Generals office here for the same type of practice. They are crooks and I don't say that often. So, I have had to change again to reduce my bill. But in the meantime, I had these horribly high bills-- just what you need in this recession. I was trying to reduce my cost."
1,"I had a $10.02 balance, unknown to me, when I moved a year ago. Comcast never contacted me. Although, I opened a new account immediately. I never received a phone call or letter. The amount went into collection.I have been in contact with the collection agency, who told me to file a complaint with Comcast. I tried to do that but Comcast says they have no information on file, so they cannot help me. It seems unjustified to me that my bill went into collections without me even having a chance to deal with it. I do plan on paying this as soon as I receive the bill from the collection agency."
1,"I am moving out of my current residence in about two weeks. Cable service was set up about a month ago for my new residence. I had ordered the service in my name with no one else on the account. My roommate had to call Comcast last night about his wife's account with who he is separated from. Comcast ask him which account ""You have three."" One of the three accounts was my new address. They verfied that his name and social security number was on the account. He freaked out and had them cancel the install. Now I never gave them permission to put him on the account nor did he give them permission to put his name on the account. I was at work when he found this out. He called me up and left three nasty voice mails accusing me of identity theft and fraud and was going to have me prosecuted. I had called Comcast. The first person hung up on me and the second asked me ""What do you want me to do?"""
1,"I had Comcast service in Charleston, SC. I moved to CT in December 2009. At that time, I was due a refund of $118. It is July 2010, and I still have not received my refund. I called customer service department at least 5 times and spoke to 5 different reps (Angelia, Michelle, Angela, Sarah, and Tony). They all promised to look into the issue and to call me back. None of them ever did call back.I'm starting to think that Comcast has an unofficial policy against issuing refunds; otherwise, I can't explain why in 7 months I have not been able to receive my money back. The refund of $118 has not been received."
1,"We moved into our place in Sept of 2009. On the first week of living here, we decided to get cable TV and internet through Comcast. Six months of making appointments and nobody was showing up to do the installation. One appointment every month for six months and nobody ever called or showed up. So, we went through with Dish Network for cable. However, we still needed internet. After one last call to Comcast to see about maybe their showing up this time. We called on 7-8-10 and they made yet another appointment for the next Sunday (today) 7-11-10 between 12 and 2pm. They actually showed up. Only this time the tech looked at our wall and said he needed to drill a hole. We said okay. He went outside and called his ""superior"" who then showed up and told us that even though every house around us had Comcast service that we cannot get the internet here through their company. They gave some excuse about some pole that exceeds a 250 ft limit; some garbage about aerial trespassing."
1,"I requested my service to be transfer to my new address. At first, I was told that a technician was coming on July 6th and I was given a time frame between 8 am to 12 pm. This day, at 9 am, I called to make sure they were coming. At that time, the customer service representative advised me that they were not coming on this day but on July 9th. I explained that I was given that date and I didn't understand why they changed the date without previous notice. This lack of responsibility form Comcast caused me to lose 2 hours from work but they could care less about it and they just limit themselves to say, ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience.""Then, I was given a different date which I changed due to personal reasons. The new day for the technician to come to my new address was today, Sunday, July 10 between 8 am and 10 am. At 9:30 am, I went online and contacted a customer service representative via online chat. All this person did was apologize and tell me that they were going to be here. They didn't show up at 10 am. At 10:45 am, I contacted again via online chat. This new representative said sorry for the delay but never solved the problem. It is now 11 am and so far,I have not received a phone call from the technician, advising of the delay or anything else. I'm cancelling my services with this company for lack of professionalism. In addition, they have been charging me for a HD box when I got tired of telling them that I do not own a HD TV."
1,"My landline and internet connection has been down now for three days. This has been an ongoing problem since we signed on to Comcast's bundle a few years ago. We have been told it's a wiring problem which a tech had been sent out to fix. We've been told it's our other phone in another room (which we do not have). Now we've been told ""there's a service problem in your area, our technicians know about it and are working on correcting it.""After 3 days you'd think they'd have figured it out. No customer rep knows who the district manager is for my area so I can't call them to complain. No one knows who the CEO is so I can't call him/her to complain. I am so tired of dealing with customer service. They cannot resolve our phone issue, and it's not just my phone but neighbors as well. You call this service? Comcast should stick with cable and forget about their ""phone & internet"" services."
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for many years. We do not have many choices for cable providers, so it is either Comcast or the Dish Network. After having a tree limb fall on our power lines, the electric service had to come and cut all the lines leading to our home, including the cable line. Within a couple of hours our electricity had been restored. I then called Comcast to tell them that I would need someone to come and repair our cable lines. I was told that it would be 48 hours to get someone to our home. I was not pleased with this response, but I agreed.Now 48 hours, 4 phone calls and one internet chat later, I still have no service. I was promised at 4:40 pm today that someone would definitely be out to restore our service only to find out their office closes at 5:00 pm. Now this leads me to believe that this supervisor (Ed) made a promise just to get me off of the phone. I am still sitting here, 3 hours later with no cable service. I pay over $220 a month for all the HD, internet, DVR and special perks of this cable company. This is horrible customer service and if people had other options they could boycott Comcast and put them out of business. I am over these big companies treating the hard working people of this country like this. Now just speaking to the call center, they again apologized for the confusion. So, this is not fair."
1,"In Feb. 2010, I disconnected my service with Comcast to change to another provider. I asked the billing department what the amount would be for my final bill. At this time, I was told that I had a zero balance. Next, I was transferred to the retention department and spoke with Naim who also told me I had a zero balance. On February 19, 2010, I called Comcast again as I received a bill of $82.09. Again, I was told by the billing department that I did not owe anything. Approximately, about six weeks later, around April 2010, I received a collection notice for this amount and called the Executive Office in Atlanta, GA. I spoke with Ms. **** who stated that this problem would be resolved and she had Archie ****  from the Executive Office in Atlanta to follow up with me. He assured me that he would ‘take care of this’ and that it would be a zero balance on my account. Ms. **** called me back to follow up and I told her that Mr. **** had resolved the issue.Since that time, I have received three more collection notices, stating that I still owe $82.09 and that this was being put on my credit report. I called the Corporate Executive Office in Philadelphia trying to resolve this issue. Each time, I was told that someone in Atlanta would call me back and this would be resolved. I have unsuccessfully been able to get Comcast to honor what I was told by four of their representatives. The customer service has been terrible. I have left at least 15 messages asking for the Executive Office to call me and when I am able to finally talk to someone, they have insinuated that I was to blame for their mistake. Archie **** then informed me that I have two accounts which was the first time I heard this as most people only have one account with a cable company and that this was a valid amount owed. I have called several more times but with no response. A few message have been left for me, about 3 to 4, but when I return the call, no one answers the phone at the numbers I am given. They have not apologized for their mistake and stated that they will not take this off of my credit report. Now, no one will not answer my calls or return my messages. They also told me that ‘nothing else will be done’ and that I could not speak with the President/CEO of Comcast as they have the final say in this matter. They, the Executive office, handles everything, and no letters, calls, etcetera will past their office.Comcast actions are deplorable, and I have never seen a company that was as unprofessional, rude, and hostile [their] organization has been. They never admitted that they made a mistake regarding telling me that I had a $0 balance, and even told me that I ""deliberately did not want to pay my bill"" (Archie Jackson told me this). No amount of reasoning on my part with Comcast could get this resolved, or to have it removed from my credit report. My issue has never been whether I owed this amount, as I initiated the call for the final balance, but the issue is I was told I didn't owe this amount on several occasions. Although I have now paid the bill, I feel that Comcast should be held accountable for their accounting error, and blatant disrespect regarding how they have treatment me. It is misleading to not tell a customer that they have two active accounts without their knowledge, when I was only aware of the one that I had at my current address. I personally do not want to ever be a Comcast customer again! Comcast has always had terrible customer service and I have complained to them several times over the years about this, but this time they have really gone too far. I am asking you to please investigate this matter. I can be reached, and I thank you for taking the time to read my letter. This has been put on my credit report affecting my credit rating."
1,"After over an hour on the phone attempting to talk to someone in authority, the connection was dropped for the fourth time. What is wrong with this company? Great! You credit me for 1 month of Internet service then have the audacity to charge me a Cut Ed fee? What the ** is that?"
1,"We, the apartment dwellers at **, are extremely unhappy with the treatment we received from your ""customer service"" people during the cable outage in Buildings C, H, and K between Wednesday (6/23/10) night's storm and the time the cable was finally restored on Saturday (6/26/10) morning around 10AM. Several of us, your cable customers, called various customer service numbers and even drove out to the Comcast offices on Protecta, DR. We were told over and over that (a) there was no record of an outage at our address, (b) everyone would have to call in to make it so and that several calls from the same address would activate a ""red flag"", (c) just because I said there was an outage and at least 24 apartments were affected, ""Tony"" couldn't take my word for it and each cable customer would have to schedule a repair appointment, individually, to have his/her cable fixed and appointments were out to June 30th and July 1st and on, (d) that I didn't need to get angry since he was only telling me that there was no outage in our area according to his computer. When I asked for a supervisor, I was transferred to someone called ""Nate"" who had no more tact than Tony and once again, he told me there was no outage listed at ** and that there was nothing he could do. Earlier that day, Doris **'s (age 81) daughter had called Comcast Cable Customer Service and was told there was no outage. She responded that she had better things to do than call cable service just for the heck of it. The customer service person said there was nothing she could do, so Doris's son-in-law drove to Protecta, DR and was told they would send someone around 2PM. Mid-afternoon Friday, Bonnie ** called a customer service number (she was just at home from the hospital, recovering from foot surgery) and reached someone in Mexico, who told her there was no outage in our area.Someone did come out around 4PM or so and said ""yes, we had an outage"". That they had found that there was a short somewhere and he had called for more technicians. He said that he had sent an email and customer service should now be aware of the situation. Then by 4:40, he was gone. I called a customer service number and a very nice customer service person in Woodridge, IL told me that there was no outage listed for our area. If a lot of people really had called, something would send an alert. When I insisted that there was indeed an outage, Maria ** put me on hold for awhile and came back to report that she had called ""dispatch"", that there was an outage, they were working on it and would work late to get it repaired. Later that evening, when there were no cable trucks to be seen, Bobbie ** called and was told by a customer service person that no outage was listed for ** and that she could schedule a repair for July 1st.Your internal communications (among and between how many locations?) seem to be totally disconnected from each other. Obviously, several calls from ** did not raise a red flag. Steve ** also called, as did Diane **, and most I've mentioned are in my building. I don't know how many from the other buildings called. When customers call to report a cable outage, they do not appreciate being told basically that what we're telling them isn't true. Since your customer service people can do nothing, cannot contact someone to investigate, cannot seem to communicate with each other, it's apparent that you really do not care about your customers as your recordings say you do. Since it did not matter that your customers (at ** address) did indeed call in several times over 48+ hours, were consistently brushed off and were treated like second class citizens, we protest your raising rates every few months with no evident upgrade in service. We have no other cable options, thus, we have to ""take it"".When I offered up names of others who had called to Tony, he said he could not check into that. Why not? We are extremely dissatisfied and still angry with your response to us. We ask you for a response to this and we want to know how you are going to fix your customer service communications and behavior. Why did it not register that there were more than a dozen calls from this address? We look forward to hearing from you and we ask also for a monetary discount on our bills for the grief we were given. It should not be incumbent on each and every customer here at E Bristol, who was without cable from Wednesday night until Saturday morning, to call you individually (as your customer service has told us). Your customers deserve better."
1,"Let me first start by stating that I live in an area where the only high-speed cable access is provided by Comcast. I have continually had a problem with slow speed with Comcast's premium connection. I've called in the past, and every time I am directed through troubleshooting procedure which includes checking cables, unplugging modem, etc. This process works, but lately my speed diminishes on a daily basis. The way I approach the problem these days is to call the automated line and get a signal refresh. Like magic this method works every time.Given the current negotiations between the FCC and ISP providers and the latest attempt to charge according to data use, I believe Comcast limits my connection speed until I call them. There is no doubt in my mind that I am paying a premium price for a sub-par service. Anybody that tells you that you get what you pay for in this Country is full of it. It simply is not true. Until we get real consumer protections again, moreover regulatory laws with regard to ISP services, save yourself the hassle and call for a refresh signal."
1,They are persistently overcharging. They have had repeated failure over months to cancel an account in spite of confirming cancellation on the phone.
1,"From day one, Comcast has been a horrible experience with service. We initially signed up for the Triple Play in 2007. After sending 3 different techs on 3 different occasions, we finally got the service we ordered. The out cable line from the Comcast cable box to the house was exposed on the lawn for over a year. We made numerous phone calls before Comcast finally returned to bury the cable. This was a huge safety issue. In 2008, our phone was shut off. We contacted Comcast and were told that we could no longer keep the telephone number and a new number was assigned to us without our choice. In June of 2010 while reviewing my Comcast bill, I noticed that we were being charged twice for internet service. I contacted Comcast and was told there was an error on the bill going back to December of 2007. The Comcast Rep informed me that someone would be calling me back in two days to determine how the account would be credited. The estimated amount of what we were overcharged was approx. $1,400. No one ever called back so I contacted Comcast again. The Comcast Rep reiterated what the previous Rep had told us. Finally, someone called us and informed us that we were only double charged from January of 2009. I explained that this was incorrect and wanted copies of all my bills. I was told they would not provide me copies and the that they would credit my account for over $700. The bill makes no sense now as they have entered several credits in various amounts which are difficult to interpret. Since contacting Comcast in June of 2009, the phone and internet service keeps going out throughout the day. On the evening of July 2, 2010, I contacted Comcast regarding the outage. The Comcast Rep stated someone would be out on July 6th. I explained that this was unacceptable. After speaking with a Comcast supervisor, I was told a Comcast Tech would be sent out on July 3rd between 1 and 3 pm. At 10:30 am on July 3rd, I received an automated message to confirm that we still needed a Comcast Tech. I replied yes. At 3:20 pm, I called Comcast as no one had showed up. The Comcast Rep put me hold and later said the Tech was running behind and that I would receive a phone call in 15 to 20 minutes. At 4:30 pm, I contacted Comcast again as no one had called. The Comcast Rep stated that the Tech phoned us at 1:10 pm but no one answered. I explained that we have been home all day and no one called my cell phone nor did I have any messages. The Rep stated we would have to reschedule for later in the week. I stated that this was unacceptable. After being on hold for 30 minutes, the Rep stated that he was working with his supervisor to find an available Tech. The Rep stated that I would receive a call back. I am still waiting. No phone call. How does Comcast get away with billing customers improperly, never showing up for scheduled appointments and poor customer service."
1,"In May 2009, I entered into contract to upgrade my services with Comcast. I was told I would receive cable, phone service and the highest available speed internet service for the price of $114.99 all inclusive (taxes, modem, etc.). I confirmed the price and services with the Comcast representative at least six times to make sure there was no misunderstanding. I agreed to the offer as offered to me by the Comcast representative. I have since been overcharged twice, the first time was an ""error"" of approximately $30-35 (which was later resolved). My last bill was for $130.31, not the $114.99 I was repeatedly promised. Calls to Comcast (Ann/May?) to resolve the matter were absolutely useless (she claimed the extra charges were for modem rental and taxes, neither of which were stated as ""extra charges"" by the original representative when I accepted). I had been told each time I asked that the $114.99 cost included everything and a promise of a call from the supervisor from that representative never came. I went to the local Comcast office on Tuesday where not only was it not resolved, but I was informed I was not even getting the promised highest speed internet either. On 9/14, I called the Comcast escalation department and spoke to David. I was essentially told, 'I'm sorry, but these are our packages and prices and there's nothing we can do"". He suggested that I ""misunderstood"". I find it difficult to accept that I ""misunderstood"" an offer I confirmed 6 times with their very own representative. I am not being provided the agreed-upon contracted services and I am being overcharged even for the services I am receiving. The ""package"", as described to me since by Comcast's subsequent representatives (Ann/May/David), is one I would never have agreed to or accepted had it been offered to me at the time. Comcast and its representatives are practicing price gouging and fraud. I can't see why I should have to pay a bill that is in excess to what I was told six times and is not providing the promised, offered and agreed to contracted services. All attempts to resolve this with Comcast have proven absolutely fruitless. Update: I received a call from Richard **, Executive Support/Research Specialist, West Palm Beach Region Office of the Vice President ** approximately 2 weeks ago. After explaining my complaint with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services against Comcast, he told me he would get back to me next week and they would try to work something out to my satisfaction. No offer was made and today, I received a letter from the DOA and CS claiming they had closed my case, following correspondence from Mr. ** which consisted of false and misleading information on his part. As of 9/2/2010, continued attempts to resolve this dispute with Comcast have met with absolute refusal on their part to honor their agreement."
1,"I have problems after buying a Comcast internet modem, my wired of cable in the house worked just fine but the company could not get signals back from my modem after days of struggles on the phone. So, I cancelled the order and they said if you want to pay a technician we may be able to connect you. Now continuing to be a Comcast cable TV customer, I cannot get a signal on the new mandated dig converter boxes again. I spend days on the phone getting technician appointments etc. They cannot activate them and said I have to pay a technician to see what is wrong. Of course prior, my wires for Comcast cable to my TV were fine.Now the point is if you want adjustments to service which are the company's responsibility you have to pay us or you get nothing. Now I am being charged $59.00/ month for about $20.00/ month work of services. When the special trouble shooter set up a technician to visit my house, the technician never showed even though they confirmed on the phone and I waited. They just never showed this is the nature of the service you must pay for what you get if you don't like what you get you can kiss our butts."
1,"Our Comcast service was turned off, so a representative left a notice on the door stating they needed to collect the boxes, my mother called the number on the notice and spoke with John. She informed him of the time that would be good to pick up the boxes, he stated he wouldn’t be in the area at that time, but he would be doing another time and he would call her to see if she or myself maybe home doing that time. When he called my Mom informed him that no one was home and that we would take the boxes in to the service center, this must have been on a Thursday. On Sunday my 15 year old brother called my mom and told her the Comcast man had came and he had him gone from room to room with him and had taken the cable boxes. John should not have entered our home and went from room to room with 15 year old. I thought a person 18 or over had to be present and I didn’t think they were allowed to enter my home and go room to room to get anything. I have complaint to Comcast and they said John supervisor would call, never heard from the supervisor. Last week another Comcast representative came to collect the boxes also, the boxes had been taken by John 2-3 week earlier. I called Comcast back again, and ask why was someone else at my home to collect boxes that had alright been collected, when she looked on their system it finally showed up the boxes where returned. The representative was very rude, I was told by her that a Comcast person can enter my home even if the isn't an adult and collect their equipment. I was very upset by their rudeness and lack of professionalism and lack of communication."
1,"We have been loyal Comcast customers for 10 years. We moved county and had to change account. This is when trouble started. We bought a new HD and 3D TV and consulted with Comcast to ensure we would get the services from them. Yes, 3D is available, I was told. 4 DVR/digital boxes and five technicians later and approximately 20 hours total phone calls during the 4 weeks, we still don't have 3D. Comcast agents have no clue when it is available here in Florida. Two weeks ago I was told June 29 and I received the right box to be able to receive it. Today is June 29 and after 3 hours (no kidding) on the phone since 7 am with Comcast, I was told by different agents: 1. you do no have the right box (incorrect); 2. you have the wrong TV (incorrect); 3. we need to send a technician to fix the problem (will be available in 3 days); 4. 3D is not available in your area yet; 5. and it's not a problem specific to you but several customers.All within 3 hours different agents made these statements and decided that there was nothing else they could do. I was trying to speak with a supervisor who could shed some light on the situation, but agents hung up on me instead. This is a typical example of my day on the phone with Comcast. I'm ready to switch to satellite. Unfortunately our home owner association has a contract with Comcast, which we opted in on when we moved here, anticipating they would be able to live up to their commitment. This has resulted to 20 hours of phone calls resulting in lost work/revenue on my side. Trying to get out of the home owners association's basic cable agreement with Comcast. We do not want to pay for services we no longer get after we switch to satellite."
1,"I decided to reduce my TV service to basic cable. I’m being charged $150.00 (plus the bill), saying there was ""an agreement"" for another year. Thought I was safer than paying over $115.00 a month for internet and TV, until they told me it has to be paid within thirty days or both services will be shut off. I called the ""billing"" number and I’m being charged $4.00 to speak with a rep (added to the bill), and now I am being charged late fees (pro rated) plus the bill and the fee to reduce my services. Comcast is a nightmare for people who are on fixed income and trying to meet their other bills, like rent and utilities and food. And in this area, there is no one else to go to. I’m trying struggle on a fixed income to pay other monthly bills and still can't watch a decent program on TV. Complaining doesn't get you anywhere. I contacted the FCC and tried to find out who makes these fees, and why, and I was told it’s company policy. No other utility company does it. Thanks for letting me vent."
1,"Comcast offers online specials, $84.99 for 6 months premium service. But they are unable to add it to my service. It took 3 hours to and two trips to local office, add it to my online account 2 times, and had it confirmed with online chat two times. I did not realize you have to fight with them to pay them $84.99 dollar a month and hook it up yourself. They acted like they don't want you as a customers. So, if that's what they want I am sure AT&T would love to have my $84.99 a month. This was the worst ever customer service. Lack of training. Customer service did not know any of the codes to enter, to get there advertised package. Overall "" False Advertising"". As I am a diabetic this was a emotional and stressful three hours and dropped blood sugars to dangerous low 43."
1,"On Feb 25, 2010, my Jeep was stolen from my then address of ** from the parking lot. In my jeep was my wallet with my identity and all of my credit, bank, and yes, my social. I filed a police report immediately and waited. My jeep was recovered but not my identification nor were any of my cards or Soc. I figured things would smooth over, but my everything went crazy and am just now able to put things back together. Three weeks ago I applied for Comcast cable and found that there are already accounts open in my name which I didn't have any knowledge of. I reported it to the police and they instructed me to give my report number to the Fraud dept. They wouldn't take it. They told me all of these things I needed to send to them by fax. I did and still have not heard anything back. Can you help? I need my name cleared."
1,"The previous Comcast Cable quality problem request resulted in a the Comcast tech destroying my central cable junction box by breaking off the cable ends to trace the signal. Comcast refused to return calls. When Comcast converted from analog to digital I refused until I could no longer watch any reasonable program. When I had to go digital, we were scheduled to receive the equip by mail (without having to deal with another scumbag Comcast contractor). He showed up unannounced!. It is now 30 days later and the digital service sucks! When I use the remote, it takes at least 4 seconds to change channels!. When you hit the button the transmission freezes, then you receive a 2 second freeze frame of another channel and finally the transmission of the channel selected. After 3 service calls the Comcast response is ""there is a bad connection somewhere in the area and it is affecting about 30 customers, but we have not found the problem"". Comcast is very similar to the old AT&T with the attitude of ""sit down shut and pay the bill"". But I will soon do the same thing for Comcast with what I did for AT&T and BS (Bell South), I will fire them! I am just waiting for the wireless internet to drop in price and Comcast and all it trash employees go go look for a new job."
1,"On Monday June 21st, my cable went out around 4:45pm. I paid the bill and was told my service would be back on within moments. By 10pm my service was still off so I called the office and was told with 24 hours my service would be back on since they couldn't send a signal to get it back up from the office. On Tuesday morning, I called to verify what time my service would be back on and was told between 8-11am. I even had a tech call me afterwards to advise the same thing. I called at 11am to see why the tech hadn't gotten to my home yet and was told it would be 12noon when he'd arrive. No one still showed.I called again at 1:15 and was told it would be Wednesday between 8 -11. By then I was very angry because my husband had sat at home all morning waiting on them to come and no one ever showed. When I told the rep this, she said that no one even needed to be home! I was livid at this point. I called back at 3p.m. and was told again it would be Wednesday before my service would be connected. Wednesday morning I called the office again at 9 to verify a tech would be here and was advised they would be here between 8-11. By 11, no one had shown up so I called and requested a manager. I spoke with a man named Chris who said he'd called dispatch and confirmed a tech would be here no later than 1:30pm. No one showed again. I called back for the 7th time!I asked why no one had come and was advised I had an all day appointment set so it could take up to 7pm to get my service back. I advised that wasn't acceptable but was told that was the timeframe so all they could do is give me a $20 credit on my next bill and credit my time for being out of service. I did not like the service I was getting at all so when I got off work at 3pm Wednesday, I decided to go to the office to complain in person. I was given a copy of the work order when I asked what guarantee I had that the tech would come by 7pm since I'd been told 3 previous appointment times and no one showed any of those times. She said well you'll get a $20 credit on your bill for a missed appointment.I told her that I was very dissatisfied and never in the 14 years that I'd been a Comcast customer had I incurred such poor service. Her response was that she was just getting in the middle of something that had already occurred and was only giving me the info she had. I thought that was VERY RUDE. I work in a customer service environment as well and never in a million years would I have told one of my customers that. Needless to say I finally got cable around 5:40pm Wednesday evening but I think something needs to be done about this. I wasted 3 days of my time on the phone and was told different info each time I called. I was with no service for 3 days and threatened to go to another cable provider but no one tried to escalate getting my service back on quicker. I am still seriously considering going to another cable provider. I work for the telephone company and they provide direct TV for a discounted rate that is a lot cheaper than Comcast, but I didn't go with them because I'd always been happy with the service. I definitely am not now!"
1,"Completely unreliable in terms of stated promises. I spent most of the month of June attempting to get the basic bundle. Each agent I called gave me different prices. Most of the agents really didn't care that their attitudes were less than friendly. One supervisor was downright rude and didn't care that I didn't sign up. I was attracted to the DSL speed so kept on trying but to no avail. One phone call to the installation agent changed the price by an additional $5 during the phone call I was on! Once I made that agreement to have them come out, they made my husband wait until 10 pm and then cancelled the order altogether. They had not successfully ported my present phone number but didn't tell him that. When he got angry (time is money in our case) they wrote the notes down that he was angry and they cancelled the call and the order. When I got back from vacation, I called again to try to find out what happened. They only read back the notes they wanted to. When I set up yet another installation agreement, I reviewed all the items I was signing up for and they omitted the rebate of $250 that I was promised by the other three previous agents.I spoke to this new agent's supervisor who said that there were no notes about the rebate and that I was not eligible for it. My contention with her at that point was not the actual promised dollar rebate but the unreliability of the promises made by Comcast prior to even having them as a service. If they were this bad in managing their agents, then I was compelled by logic to believe they would be horrendous when push came to shove and I really hired them and then had a problem. They lost my business due to shoddy business management. A large company that they have become has lost touch with its core and its tendrils. I recommend staying far away from them. "
1,"My service was disconnected without notice on 6/23/10. I am the manager of this community and I am supposed to receive a discount of which I have never had after numerous requests. I made a payment for 2 months on June 4th. When I called today, an incompetent rep told me there was no payment made. When I called back, they then said the routing number they input was incorrect so it was not posted. No courtesy letter or phone call was made. I made a payment today 6/23/10 approx. 10:00am which cleared immediately by debit card. I still have no phone or digital cable service and it is 12:41 pm. This was totally uncalled for."
1,"I was sent letters and even a modem since Comcast was upgrading its system.  The letters stated that I needed a new modem and could go online to see the approved list of modems or rent one from them.  When I looked at the list, the modem I currently own was on the list.  I chatted with someone online about this and they said I would not have any problems if my modem was on the list.  Then, I received a modem in the mail.  I called to ask why I received the modem when the modem I owned was on the list.  The lady stated that the modem was indeed on the list and they just needed to verify that I had not changed modems without telling them.  She also stated that since my modem was on the list, I should not have any problems. This morning (upgrade was to happen yesterday) my modem does not work.  I was told it was at the end of its life and needed to be replaced.  I could see needing to replace the modem if it was not on the approved list.  But why do I need to replace an approved modem with another approved modem?  Comcast must be really off on their budget or they could care less about their customers."
1,"I moved to a new address on May 28, 2010.  Erroneously, Comcast billed me for my old and new address for $179 & amp, and $155 respectively.  After contacting them on or around June 15, 2010, I was informed that I would receive a refund for my old account for $113.  The charges due on my new service had a due date of June 30, 2010.  On June 22, 2010,  I receive a statement noting my unpaid balance (again not due until June 30th) of $155 and new charges of $146.28 due by July 15, 2010. Customer service advised me that Comcast bills a month in advance for new service.  This was not brought to my attention when I spoke to a customer representative on June 15, 2010.  I was also informed that my refund would take 4 to 6 weeks to process. So in the meantime, Comcast wants a grand total of $301.38 by July 15, 2010.  Granted, I was assigned a new account number but realistically it is a continuation of old service, and not a new service.  It also was a convenient way of wiping out my refund. I requested to speak with a supervisor and was placed on hold.  After several minutes, the customer service representative informed me that no one was available at the present time and asked if I would continue to hold.  It was at this point that I stated that I would try again later."
1,"There are several cable wires that lead from my house to the pole. I have attempted, many times, to have these wires either removed or raised. During a recent storm, they were pulled from the house and are lying on the ground. There are small children and animals at this residence. I have waited the entire day for a technician to show up for what I was originally told would be a 2pm appointment. I called the company at 1pm and was informed that this they have until 8pm to show up. I have been in the house the entire day because I am needed to unlock the gate."
1,"I was shut off on Sunday night. They said because of past due. I paid the $338 plus first months and deposit and still, I have no service. That was $475.00. After Cody took the payment, he suddenly noticed that the service address had $1800.00 in past due. I and my roommate had filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy on everything but the $338.00. He said he would cancel the $475.00 transaction and it would be back on my card that day, the 15th of June. It is the 18th and I'm still without TV and my card still has a zero balance. I can't even call DirecTV because Comcast has my money. That's a week's pay, nobody can afford it."
1,"After years of having ""less than basic"" cable we decided to ""upgrade.” Big mistake! Leave well enough alone. After 3 trips out to our house where we have to wait around 4 hours for each visit, we still do not have a functioning ""upgraded"" cable. They've also managed to ** up the internet so we do not have internet service either. I would highly discourage anybody from signing up with Comcast. When I spoke to a supervisor about the first mistake, he simply offered, ""That was the technician's error.” He refused to credit my account or offer anything for the inconvenience. Boycott Comcast until they learn how to provide decent customer service!"
1,"I was first charged inaccurately to lease my own modem as if it were Comcast's modem. I told them repeatedly over about three years time that it was my own modem they were charging me for. Finally, I took the modem in to show them and the customer service rep agreed that it indeed was not Comcast's property and promised that she would speak with her manager when the manager returned in the morning to credit my account. She said she had noted the whole situation and that my credit ($100 +) would show up on my next bill. It didn't and I spoke to many people over the next several months trying to get the issue resolved. Six to eight months later, after having to take my modem back in for verification, at which time I canceled my high Speed internet service through them, I was finally credited about a month later. I only kept my basic cable service until a few months ago, I started receiving calls to pay my bill in full. At which time, I requested my cable service to be disconnected and for them to ensure that all Comcast services be terminated. Shortly thereafter, I started receiving daily calls either in person or on my voice mail telling me that I still had their equipment, which I had none of, and that I would not only be charged for but fined for keeping. I told them consistently that I didn't have their equipment and that they needed to be responsible for their own record keeping. I also let them know that the situation had become more than annoying on my end and that they were not welcome to call me anymore. As of today, I am still receiving harassing phone calls from Comcast and their contracting company CRC with the same accusations."
1,"Comcast offers a DVR service. This purports to allow you to record a show (or shows) whilst watching another channel, or when you are away from home. Fine, in theory. Sadly the USA seems behind much of the rest of the world in this area? Comcast habitually starts shows a minute or two late. This means that a recording for 6-7 will chop off the final minute or so if the show starts at 6.01? Okay, they say just set the recorder to end a minute or two late. Fine but that means the machine sees that as an 'overlap' on a following show, which will either not be recorded at all, or will in its tune be shortened (in this case 'beheaded!')Most other countries have a system where the program carries a code, and when that hits the DVR, the DVR records, so it does not matter if the program is a minute or two late as it records by actual start not 'TV Guide ' start! Simple huh? Elegant too! This also takes care of those situations where you as otherwise find that and extra 2 million years tacked onto a football or baseball game has 'bounced' your favorite episode of Dora The Explorer' so you have some sweaty jocks instead of cartoon goodness.. lol.The other major failing is 'series recordings' where one can select 'only new episodes.' Fine except that apparently episodes are 'new' for as many times as Comcast decides to call them so! I want to record 'Curious George Finds the Last Intelligent Person at Comcast'. I set it up for Monday 7pm - 8pm. It records (bar the end as mentioned before so he never finds this mythical intelligent Comcast person) I watch the show and then delete it. When I come to watch another show, I set to record (say 'Comcast - Great frauds of the 21st Century') I find it has not recorded at all? For why? Because Comcast's cretinous cable DVR box does not 'remember' that I have recorded and watched and deleted the 'new' episode of the Curious George series recording, so as it appears as a 'new' episode it has recorded it again and bounced my recording of the other show! So, when is a repeat not a repeat? It's when it is a 'new' episode being shown for the 4th time that week! Of course nothing is ever a repeat in cable-land, it's an 'Encore Presentation.' Hmm.So, Comcast's box can neither record my shows reliably if they start or end late (as they very often do) or make sense of series recordings. Their engineers seem not even to understand the issues, let alone a possible cure, and when I try and bring this to their attention (telling them I am recording them) they tell me 'I am not allowed to do that' and hang up on me.. despite their own announcement that 'this call may be recorded' as they do not understand the difference between 'might be' and 'may be' where the word may gives implicit consent as in 'you may leave the table'. What a total waste of space they are. Given that we pay a premium for a DVR box and it is not fit for purpose I smell a class action here? "
1,"I asked to have service installed in my new place. I was told that Thursday between 8 and 11 am, the tech would arrive to install my three boxes, internet, and phone. The tech arrived on Thursday close to 3 hours late, smelling as if he'd been working on a roof top that was exposed to the hottest sun all morning. Nothing but sweat funk followed him into my home. As he fumbled around my home, he kept telling me things he could not do, like fix a line in my office that would allow the modem to be placed where I needed it, place a DVR in my bedroom as I'd requested, and provide a cord to go from the wall port to the DVR unit in my family room. I thought these were the basic functions of a technician, but I was told otherwise.All of this would have just been a minor annoyance if the next issues would not have occurred. I had to be in my front room to conduct a business call, as he was in my bedroom setting up. He seemed to be having a technical issue and had to contact the main office for a lengthy call to remedy the problem. My daughter walked out of her room and stood before me with a puzzled look on her face. She asked ""Daddy, did you say it was OK for him to be lying on your bed?!"" Now, this was not just lying on my bed linen. As I said, I was moving, so he was lying directly on my mattress, transferring the aforementioned epic odor to the part of the bed where I normally lie my head and face, as I am known to sleep upon my stomach. So ingrained in my mattress is the smell of armpit, back, and rear end, as well as a bit of mud on the edge. Originally, they offered a new mattress. But the claim was then denied by the contract company's boss, who said to me ""That's a bit of ** overkill."" Never again! My wife, plagued with leukemia, cannot sleep in our bed; neither can I."
1,"I have never had such a horrible experience dealing with a company as I did dealing with Comcast! I spent over 4 days calling and emailing people with my complaints and in the end, I only ended up more frustrated than ever. I have had Comcast service for 5 years after moving back to the area. My boyfriend and I recently purchased a house, so I contacted Comcast to transfer my service from my old home to the new address. I went through all of the details and when I was about finished, I was told that there was a do not service flag on our new address. They wanted us to come into their office and provide all types of documents showing that we were in fact the new owners of the home. I explained that we both worked crazy hours and that this was next to impossible. I then asked for a supervisor and was told that one wasn't in the office yet (Monday morning at 9am). I was told I would receive a call back from someone within 2 hours according to operator 92Z since you can't get a person's name anymore. I finally received a call from Michael 3 hours after the promised time. Michael was rude and completely ignorant and kept stating that there was nothing he could do. At this point, I am extremely frustrated so I go on Comcast.net and write an email venting my frustration. 2 days later, I receive a call from Sandy (supposedly from Corporate Comcast). The conversation went from bad to worse when all she called to tell me was that there was nothing she could do for me (I wasn't asking for money) I was looking for compensation such as a new offer for my inconvenience.When I threatened to leave Comcast and go with Dish Network she didn't even care! So my final words to Sandy were so basically you wasted 5 minutes of my work day to call me and tell me you can do nothing for me and her response was ""Yes, I did!"" I got off the phone and immediately called my boyfriend to inform him I was done with Comcast for good! He decided to see if he could handle things by actually going in to the York, PA office. When he went in the agent was rude. She let it slip that the charges from the previous owners was for equipment and the address should have never been flagged! So in other words, she basically came out and said they were in error.When asked what she could do to make the situation right for our inconvenience and time, she said nothing! When he asked why he shouldn't switch to Dish Network, she had the audacity to say, ""He probably should!"" This got him going and when he got home he called Comcast and demanded to speak with someone who could do something for him. He eventually reached a Manager in the Lebanon, PA Office who actually listened to our story and was appalled at what had happened. In the end, this manager offered us such a deal that we ended up staying with Comcast. So, when you need something done do not call Customer Service or Sandy at Corporate because they obviously have no power to do anything to keep their customers happy, but I do recommend you keep complaining because they can do something for you! Comcast is not a company that believes that their customers are always right!"
1,"After 3 years of loyalty and 7 months of trying to get special pricing to lower my bill I had decided to leave Comcast as I got a much better deal with a satellite TV company. I called Comcast to advise them I needed my service turned off. They advised me I would have a $29.95 fee to send a tech to put a filter on my line. I asked to speak to a manager, who informed me, the same. I asked where it is stated they will charge this if you cancel. I was advised that it is not in writing but is available on some channel on their cable station. I think this is terrible service. I will never use them again. I will be writing to the company- but also posting all over the social network sites. I am so appalled."
1,"After several months of having incorrect bills, as well as invalid charges, poor service and inability to have representatives reconcile account, I made my most recent attempt today, June 12, 2010 to correct bill and zero out account. I would cancel the service, but need it and there are few other comparable services to switch to and they cost fees to transfer, new installation, as well as have this balance remain. My account had been placed in a past due status and was suspended. But the only bill needing to be paid is my current bill due 6-6-10, that I am trying to rectify so I can make the payment (for the valid bill amount). Because of the suspension, I was repeatedly routed (after a several minute long automated answering service) to the payment department, which is not equipped to handle and reconcile accounts (they can only take payments, nor can they transfer to a department that can assist customers). Supervisors are not able to assist either. I was hung up on 3 times. I became more irate, as I had to go through this process, and have wasted 3 hours on my Saturday and still have not been able to resolve the issue. There are bogus ""trip fees"", misc. installation charges and additional fees applied to my account without my knowledge or consent. These charges comprise the ""outstanding balance"" on my account, and I refuse to make those payments as they are invalid. I am concerned that Comcast will continue to accrue charges, report to my credit and continue to harass me over this amount. I cannot continue to deal with them, they have horrible service, incompetent staff and continue to make bogus charges, alter bills, and even delete bills. Online account management shows differently than the paper bills. It is a complete mess. I am waging a formal complain, for all of these issues, I am a single parent who has to take several hours away from her children on the weekend, the only time she has to share with them, to discuss this bill over and over, without full resolution and become agitated and I am extremely disappointed with the company as a whole. I am appalled by the lack of service orientation and the inability to actually assist their customers. The amount of time I have had to call, web chat and email with Comcast is ridiculous. I should be reimbursed for all the time spent on this matter. I would never recommend this service to another customer. The waste of time just to get to a representative through the automated service is enough to complain about. Extreme emotional distress form myself, and affects my children by decreasing quality time on the weekend and the bad attitude I am in, as a result of dealing with this company."
1,"After having nothing but bad experiences with Comcast Cable, I decided to switch service for awhile and try something else. We had horrible DVR service with them and also had to jump through hoops when moving 8 miles! When calling up, the lady was initially somewhat nice. I informed her that I wanted to cancel my cable but I did want to stay a customer and keep my internet service. I knew the price would go up as I was under a discount which was fine.After realizing that I would not take any offers to keep their cable, the lady informed me that the price to just have internet would be $59.95, which was not what I had been told or what the website said either. When I told her that the retail price listed on the website was $44.95 and I had no issues paying that, she got very rude and informed me that the price I have to pay is the $59.95 and that's that and she's been there for 10 years and she knows. I then informed her that the terms of service on their site said nothing about a higher price nor this being a promotional price, there were only two prices listed that of a promotional for new customers and the retail price. I then asked to speak with her supervisor, which she fought and became very rude. I just kept asking to speak with her supervisor and saying “thank you” until she finally went and got him.The supervisor was initially very nice and listened to my complaint. I told him that I just wanted to pay retail pricing and I'm not asking for any discounts. I just don't want to be charged a ""punishment fee"" for not keeping their cable. I was told that they can charge whatever they want because the terms of service state you should call Comcast for pricing and service listing. The answers from both the initial rep and the supervisor changed constantly, they were clearly grasping for anything to justify their price. I was told first that it was a regional price and I was on their countrywide site, when I informed them that I put in my zip code and even a few addresses to get pricing they said that the prices I see were promotional. This then changed when I said that ""no, promotional is also listed and this is listed as the regular retail price"", then I got the response that that is not the real retail price. They could not produce the price they were going to charge me on any documents, I was told it would be on my bill and that's the only way I could see it.I believe this is completely wrong and the worst customer care out there. Never have I been talked to and treated so horribly. All I wanted was to pay retail and instead was getting cheated and given some mysterious price. I hate to think of how many others are getting robbed by these prices that they choose and you have no way to fight. I was told there was nothing they could do and when I asked to speak with a manager, I was told he couldn't do anything either that their hands were tied. I informed them that I would look for another provider and cancel all my services as soon as I could. It was like I was being robbed over the phone and nobody cared. This is a horrible for a company who claims to be trying to increase customer service ratings."
1,It's the past due Billing and collections. They keep telling I owe them $140. I opened an account. I found out my roommate already had one. She downgraded due to travel and I didn't need. They billed me; I called said my roommate who has an account closed this one. They never did. I called several times. They left it open and still harass me. I kept calling telling them to close it!
1,"I am upset about company harassing me about a non-issue from the past. I have used Comcast for many years and all of my families as well. One of your employees gave me my prepaid monthly fee back because I was in good standing when I changed to another company. This change was due to losing a job. I had to cut back. This was in 2008. Later today, I rebutted this old charge (again) because my prepaid month was returned to me. That alone establishes that I was in good standing and I owed nothing monetarily. I was told Comcast would pick up the box. I was not working during that period. I was laid off. How can your company state that because Comcast stated they would pick it up, it is my fault? No, I did not make your employees pick up your box within a week. It is not my fault. This has been two years. I paid my bills or I would not have been refunded. I have requested Comcast to not harass me anymore. I have requested data from Knology to document when I started using Knology. P.B. There were no other applicable fees or charges. Documents will be provided to dictate and prove Knology start date at my home and how they scheduled appointments and did not show. I will make sure my family and friends know how they will be treated when they use Comcast. "
1,"The on demand say error every time we try to get it on the TV. When I tried to call Comcast, each phone call was dropped. The only person I could reach on line was Moses and he said he couldn't help me. I asked him for another phone # I could call. Even that one dropped my call. Help! It's pretty bad to pay what we do for the Triple Play and can't watch the stations we want and can't even call to find out what is wrong! "
1,"Comcast is taking channels away from their basic service then trying to get you to pay $7-$8 per month to get them back via cable set box rental. They claim they can change their channel line up at any time so you are stuck. They have taken away 8 high definition channels and three other channels for a total of 11 channels, you have no recourse except go to Rabbit ears to get your Hi-Def Local channels or go to satellite service. I think that our apartment building should receive the $7-$8 per month per unit back as they decreased our service in that amount. Maybe some attorney out there would like to file a class action against these deceptive business practices."
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for many years. Lately, I am very unhappy with their service. I happen to be one of the unfortunate people that don't have a credit card or a bank account. Comcast acts like it is a crime. My bill is due on the first of the month and I always pay it when I say that I am going to pay it, but Comcast is very uncooperative with there customers. They act like you are stupid. Because they tell you things like they cannot manually access your account. But as soon as they get there money the service is activated, how is that if they cannot access anything. I even had someone tell me once to hang up call back maybe I will have better luck with someone else. That is the kind of people Comcast has working for them. Maybe I should sue them for false advertising.On TV they talk big about how they can resolve any problem and that they are available to you 24/7 but that is a lie. When ever you call there is always a problem and all you get sometimes is a recording what ever happened to talking issues out with a real person. The reason I stay with Comcast is because they are the only company that offers triple play service in my area which is Detroit Mi. At and t is working on bringing there service to my area soon when they do it is going to be good by Comcast. Comcast needs to revise there service big time if they don't want to keep loosing customers. I work for the state and get paid the 2nd Thursday of every month which usually falls the week after my bill is due but I always get my service cut and then when I pay the bill I get charged all these turn on fees if they would work with me it would not happen. I think it is very unfair. Comcast your service in Detroit, MI is bad big time."
1,"When I signed up for Comcast, I was told the total first bill would be $79 and some change for TV, Internet, and installation charges (as well as fees and taxes). My first bill arrived, and it was $236.28. I immediately called Comcast and I ran through the list of charges on my bill. The CSR saw there were errors and informed me that she had removed them and that I would see another bill. I never received another bill, but I logged onto Comcast, and I saw that another erroneous charge still remained.I tried calling Comcast, and the call never connected (it would ring once, Comcast would answer, and then there was silence). I decided to hop on the Live Chat for answers. I waited 30 minutes. When someone finally came, they couldn't tell me anything. I was staring right at my screen showing what my bill is, and they were telling me it was something different. When I questioned the fee on my bill, they told me that was discounted $20, which it wasn't. The HSI Standard Install fee was $49.95; however, we didn't get HSI (High Speed Internet) so they deducted $20 and made it the $29.95 Internet install fee. I questioned what the fee in question was and I was told, ""It's for reconnecting your cable"".  I told them it was a brand new account! They told me, ""let me check,"" and then I was on hold (online!) for another 15 minutes. He informed me of a different amount than what shows on my bill was for installing service at my home (even though I was given a different amount. ) I still could not get through Comcast's customer service via the telephone. Moral of the story: don't believe Comcast when they tell you (exactly) how much an install will be. Always plan for the amount to be paid to be at least double. "
1,"We returned our cable boxes back on May 5, 2010 and cancelled our service. We signed up with WOW. Comcast is still billing us and we have spent hours on the phone with their customer service, who promise that it will be corrected. It has not been corrected as of today 6/8/10--over a month. I can't stand this company and I am sick of talking to the slugnutty idiots in their customer service."
1,"On June 5, 2010, I was surprised with an increase of my bill from $66.00 bundle package to $104.94. Comcast did not notify me ahead of time for this increase. A month ago, when I went to pay for my bill at Comcast-Hayward, I asked a staff in that office for any promotions. The staff told me that he will give me 12 months of premium channel for $9.99 and continue the $66.00 bundle package for another 12 months. When I received my bill, I was surprised that my bill was for $164.99. When I called Comcast, I was subjected to talk to different representatives about it. Comcast refused to honor what this company originally offered me. After I hung up the phone, my internet service got disconnected and I had to make more calls to question my internet service. I spent my whole day trying to resolve the billing issues and technical difficulties that I continue to experience. Today, June 7, 2010, I turned on my television set and I found that Comcast also disconnected my cable service. I had to call again to find out about my cable service. A technician by the name of Karen, had told me that someone disconnected my service. She has to turn on my service. I was on the phone waiting for half an hour to get a cable service again. It appears that Comcast had been playing with my services by someone turning it on and off.I've missed my 11:00pm show because I had to spend half an hour to get a technician on the line. Only to tell me that she is sorry, she will turn the cable service on. How can you get Comcast to do fair business practices? How can I stop Comcast staff to play with my cable and internet services. "
1,"Comcast sent a technician out turning off service to various homes in my neighborhood without notice. They said they were cleaning out the cable system or adjusting there frequency’s power. In order to turn back on my service, they had to send a technician out to check my home system which was working fine. The technician said I had a bad splitter and switched it out. Remember, everything was working fine in my end until they decided to unplug me from the system. Example: you go get your oil check, which you know is fine, and the mechanic switches the oil, 4 to 8 quarts and filter--charging full boat. I have just been taken without notice or warning. Comcast charged me $27.99 plus $1.54 for the surcharges and fees. I am going to switch to a different provider."
1,"Although their customer service number states that they are open 24/7, it's not.  I also tried at 11:30 AM today at their 800 number, and was told customer service was unavailable, and to try again. I've sent 2 emails about my erroneous and ever changing bills (not one in the past 15 months has been the same), but have never received a response to the emails. Last year, I spent months speaking to 7-9 different people to correct this matter. I never received a logical or adequate response, they just kept adjusting the bill. When I finally received customer service using their local number, they couldn't explain my bills for the past year and a half. They had to research and call me back (in my experience it won't happen). Furthermore, I was told that ""bundling"" service does not really exist, as my cable, phone, and internet all expired at different times, although all of them  were installed on same date. I was told that after 12 months, my bundle discount for all three services would go from $89 to $110. Now, I am told that each service is expiring on different months (although installed on same date), and that the basic rate for bundle of all three was never $109.99, is not now, and never was. Literature I have from your company indicates that after 12 months, the bundle of all three goes to $109.99 per month plus taxes and any extra channels ordered. I was told I never had the bundled package. Now, they want to do the same thing this year as last, and charge more than I contracted, or was promised. The bills are not decipherable. Not one is the same, so I cannot figure out what I'm receiving, or what's charged.  I've been chared for HD service from day one, although I never received the correct box. The installer gave the wrong box, and I  was unable to connect to the internet.  The installer said  he'd return the next day (didn't, and I set up myself). I was supposed to get HBO on demand, but I don't.  The screen says I have to pay for it, but my bill says I have been paying for it. I am paying for services I haven't been receiving.  On top of that, this year, as well as last year, you are increasing my bill again, without adequate explanation, and refuse to abide by your agreement and contract.  Now, you are advertising that basic bundled service after 12 months increases to $109.99, which your rep has denied.  I have your ads, and you are bound by them.  Bait and switch is illegal.  I have seen countless complaints in the internet for the same things. I've been a paralegal for 30 years.  I do not need your attorney (he represents you, and does not represent my interests).  He can call me if he wants, but how he can get you out of your contract and advertisement's promises (in print and commercials), I would love to hear."
1,"Comcast said they'd arrive between 2-5 on a Sunday. They didn't. I called at 5. I waited on hold for 25 minutes. They rep said a technician would be calling me in 15 minutes or less. They didn't. I called back at 6. I waited another 15 minutes. The rep said the same thing - which a tech would call soon. They didn't. It gets worse. I asked for an adjustment to my service. The first time I asked - I asked via the chat site. After many questions - the person told me they weren't ""authorized"" to make billing changes. (It would have been handy had something said that right up front.) When I asked the rep on the phone to make an adjustment, he told me he couldn't (after saying he could), because it might require adjusting one of my services (phone). This company is clearly run by morons."
1,"Internet, cable and phone service has been intermittent or down since our original installation date in late December, 2009. We have placed several calls to customer service and they have reset the modem each time, checked signal strength, and did various forms of diagnostic tests which temporarily fix problems. On May 15, 2010, after not having phone or internet service for over a week, we finally were able to call customer service. They were to send a technician on May 16, 2010, or at latest, May 19, 2010. No one showed either day.Again, we called customer service and a technician was sent on 5/25/10. The technician walked in to the apartment stood 5 feet from the cable box and flashed his flashlight. He refused to listen to what issues were had, refused to call a manager, and he was asked to leave since he was let in the home to fix a problem and did nothing. We spoke to a manager on 5/26/10, who stated that he would send another technician to diagnose the problem and would call us back after the diagnosis to discuss crediting our account. On 6/2/10, that same technician came out (even though we were told he wouldn't be sent), but this time he replaced all the wiring and connections in the apartment. He told us that the building was known to have intermittent service, known because a fellow employee lives in the same building and advised him of such. All he said we could do was continue to call when our service is down since the connection and service problem is not on our end but on the provider's end. The manager has yet to call us to discuss crediting our account.On 6/5/10, out internet was down 4 times in 2 hours, the modem was reset again and we spent an hour on the phone without accomplishing anything, and even during that conversation the internet went down again. Our repeated requests to speak with a manager were denied / ignored, and we have yet another technician coming out on 6/9/10. We have been given reference number CR205503434 and CR207887591. We were offered a onetime $50 credit for 5 months of limited service, missed appointments (as ""promised"" on the Comcast commercials, they credit the account for missed appointments), and we will still have the same issues of limited or no service in the future. I do not believe that this is a fair compensation. There is no other cable or internet service provider in our area and we are forced to have their service or we would go elsewhere. We purchased cell phones since we did not have dependable home phone service. While this isn't a big deal, we would like to actually get the service we pay for."
1,"For the year, I had them, they gave me the run around about $99/month billing. My contract shows $90/month in two different places. Now that I am cancelled (can one ever get away from those people? ), as of Sept. 2009 (I went to Taiwan), they continue to bill me! (While in the lobby, I observed three different people there for no other business than to ask, ""Why, when I cancelled service, are you still charging me?"") I return in March 2010 and called to ask the same thing to which I was assured things would be taken care of. I came back June of this year to find my bill has gone to collections and they are threatening to go to the three credit reporting agencies! Did I mention, while I was gone I had some people from South Korea staying at my house and Comcast came by and managed to get $124 out of them? So, now I am back and I wish I could charge them for all the time I am spending on this most not American of dealings! I am given a confirmation number for a time that they will call (it has been ""escalated""), and I need to be by the phone from Wed. to Fri. in the morning hours. The time came and went to no avail!When I called back, they were all apologetic, but happy to set me up with another conformation number for a call back. No thank you! Oh, by the way, and this is a dozy, honest! My neighbor across the street, they had them for 1 and 1/2 months, deciding to cancel. It was easier pulling out your wisdom teeth with a pair of pliers without Novocaine! The bill reached above $700, so my neighbor made a deal. They said, ""split the cost, you walk away, and never bother us again!"" Comcast accepted this! And now my neighbors do not even want to enter into a class action law suit, should I be able to wrangle one! But, my neighbors stated, if Comcast comes around offering their services for 10 years, and for free, they still would not accept!They are, by far, the most maddening, irresponsible, inept, clingy, blind, deaf and dumb, ungracious, do nothing, clumsy, muddle headed, two faced, idiotic, right hand not knowing what its left hand is doing company, that has ever spawned a desire to succeed, on the face of the planet, that I have ever had the misfortune of doing business with! What makes them think that, once you enter into a contract with them, that they own you for life? I will report them and I will sue them for all of my time! I will do my best effort to make them blink! How dare they! They are without shame! PS. I do not think they have anybody in this area code any more. That is, now that I have quit them! $124.00 and the threats of it being reported to the credit card reporting agencies! Time and distraction."
1,"Seriously? I've been a customer for 15+ years. I've been through so many DVRs (refurbished, my butt). Called, emailed, went to local office, they always have some problem, specifically not working. Yet they still charge me month after month. Discounts for crappy service? Nope. Going to DirectTV."
1,"Poor quality. Inability to provide service paid for. Difficult to communicate problems through voicemail ""Hell"" 800 numbers. They asked us to take off work to get service a week later. Unable to meet consumers basic needs for service paid for. Lost entertainment time paid for. Lost time and effort trying to get problems corrected. Lost competition for services due to monopoly standard."
1,"Two days in a row at the same time (10:30 am), my phone service went out and came back on 8 pm at night. The second time it happened I had to drive up the road to call on my cell phone. A technician came and said that my cable was loose. Funny it happened at the same time. Today I had the TV show scrambled for 15 minutes off and on. Just now I was watching a show and another show’s voice was on. Sometimes the voice just does not come on or it freezes up. The consequence: stress."
1,"I have attempted for three days now to contact Comcast regarding continual issues with accessing my email through their service. I keep getting a server issue error message. I have been unable to contact them via internet or telephone. The automated message keeps telling me they are experiencing ""higher than normal"" call volumes. Perhaps this means others are having the same problem. I am ready to drop the service as I have had ongoing unresolved issues with digital cable as well. I feel like I am throwing my money away!"
1,"Now, I had 2 different technicians come out to fix my cable and internet. Both failed and left before the problem was resolved. I don’t mind paying $120 a month for cable service but if they can’t fix problems that they cause, it’s not worth the money. I’m considering canceling and taking the business elsewhere."
1,"I've been with Comcast since the switch a few years ago. I thought Time Warner was bad about things like accounting methods, repair services and CSRs who clearly have no idea what they are doing - whether you get them on the phone or have the misfortune to have them come to your home. A few weeks ago, contractors fixing my neighbor's fence sliced through the cable line, disconnecting all my services. I called the customer service line, told them the problem and the guy told me he was going to ""expedite"" the order because I had no services whatsoever at that time. Three days went by and no Comcast, so I called back and they told me they have no record of me calling at all. As to the reference number I was given, the operator told me there is always a six digit number and I only had four. The real kicker, when I asked for another reference number in case the same thing happens again, she gave me a five digit number!When I called her on it, she said that was the number coming up on her screen, so that was the one I should use if I had to call back. The next day, they finally made it to my house to fix the problem, which they did, only the tech didn't rebury the lines and told me I would have to call Comcast and have them send another tech guy to do this, that he wasn't responsible for doing this. I just don't understand how these people get away with running a company this way. If I ran my business this way, I wouldn't have one! Oh and I forgot, apparently according to their accounting methods, me being without my services for four days total was only worth twenty dollars and considering I pay $150.00 for the bundle package, I think their math leaves much to be desired!"
1,"Today, I lost my phone service and internet access for 12 hours. I live in the woods and my cell has no bars. I am 63 and need this service I pay for. Every time I get a bill, the price goes up and the service goes down. This has happened 3 times this month."
1,"I have been dealing with Comcast for about 6 months now on getting charges removed from my bill. I cancelled their home phone service and showtime service in December. I continued to get billed for it. In addition to these charges, since I did not pay the bill, I got charged with late fees and reconnect fees. In one instance, they had credited back some money to me and in the same bill charged me these fees. I told the rep that it seemed like a slap in the face for them to admit wrong in the same statement that they charged the fees. She credited half. In another call, I spoke to someone about getting the last fees removed of $12 and it was a very pleasant call, one where she understood why the fees needed to be credited. I just received my last bill and apparently the bogus reactivation fees are on there still. I made another call and the operator advised me that the credit request was placed, but that my service was due to be interrupted again! Comcast service is included with my rent outside of a DVR and internet modem charge. I'm not sure how they get away with treating a member of such a large account this way but they do. Please contact them and tell them to stop taking advantage of consumers and to get their billing practices on the right track."
1,"When paying my bill of $162.24 online, Comcast took $580 from my bank account. They will not refund the excess. I'll have possible Bank NSF's on bills and loan payments."
1,Now any discounts we get will be in vain because I will have to take time off work and lose out on pay so I can meet a tech at the house to then be charged for a service call.
1,"After having to reschedule several times within two weeks because techs failed to show up and customer service hung up on me, I refused the free movies option that the supervisor recommended and asked for a free month of service. I was granted the free month of service but then they retaliated by slowing down my internet, phone and cable services. Not only was I late for interviews, but this delayed my job search while waiting for techs. More importantly, that same week, my computer contracted a vicious Trojan virus entered my computer and damaged it completely. I never had viruses on my computer before this. I always had it very well protected. It’s just too coincidental. Now all I get is a box saying ""Access Violation to Module (numbers)"" with another box saying something about ending Comcast AntiSpy something. I never had a problem with my computer until I dealt with Comcast. Now I have no computer to go job hunting. "
1,"I am a professional photographer. I usually have to download and upload photos for clients in a timely manner. For past 2 to 3 months, I have been having internet connection issue. My internet gets disconnected; therefore, my business phone gets disconnected since it is running over the internet (Vonage). The tech from Comcast came to my place and tried to troubleshoot this issue. Every time they came, they reset the router and it worked but the next day I had same issue. Last week, one more tech came and I said that I have issue with my wireless router so he suggested to me to get router from Comcast which I did. I still have issue with my internet connection. Yesterday and today, I called again but still it's the same issue. I am paying for this service but it never works as expected. This issue has impacted my business greatly. I am not able to deliver photos to my client on time which is having a bad impression on my clients. Moreover, I am not able to answer customer calls since my phone is not working along with my internet. Since my phone does not work, I have to use my personal cell phone which is costing me money every time I call them and be on the line for at least 15 to 20 minutes. "
1,"I am writing to complain about a general problem. It is 7am and half the channels available to me are ""paid programming!"" I am paying a basic cable rate of 63 dollars for Comcast to make profits by removing real programming and put on shill advertising, much of which the producers of usually get convicted of fraud and larceny (See Kevin **). Why are they allowed to do this? They are charging us to selling us programming they are in return paid to air.There either has to be a reduction in rates equal to the amount they take in in paid programming or this programming must stop. In the worst economic crisis in the last 30 years, Comcast's profits were up nearly a billion dollars in late 2009. I do not begrudge a company making a profit but isn't this supposed to be similar to a public utility company. That's why we let them wire up the cities. The old Mayor of my hometown warned of this type of rampant abuse of the public trust, when cable first came to the City."
1,"Well where to start, I have had many problems over the past couple years more recent the past year. I have continually had problems with my boxes working and with on demand. I eventually gave up for a while due to the fact that I could not tolerate being treated so poorly and not getting the service that I am expected to pay for. Most recently on Saturday May 15, 2010 I went to a Comcast office because my HD box was not working getting on demand and one of my other boxes just stopped working completely a few days prior. So I get to the Comcast office and there is a door to slide the boxes in (thick glass) and the 1st thing that happened was the lady yelled at me for putting them in the wrong way? I mean like I was a child, the customer next to me felt the need to get involved and said maybe you should have a sign on how to put them in if there is a certain way to do so.Then when I told her I only need to exchange them for not working, she proceeded to tell me that the number on my HD box did not match up. I told her that is the only one we had and about 7 months (or so) ago one of the cable guys tried to exchange it that was the only time it would have been switched to fix the problem. She said well he shouldn’t have done that and that now I would have to pay an extra $9.95 per month for the extra box. I proceeded to tell her that it is not an extra box, we only had the one HD box and I did not want to pay $9.95 for a box that one of the employees made a mistake on. She said until that other one is turned in I would have to do exactly that. She refused to try and help in any way just belittling me. I told her to give me the box because we needed it and that I would call the 800 number. She said they won’t do anything ( as she was mumbling things about hating dealing with this) She finally gave me the box (charging me of course)and then asked me if I had the slip from 6-8 months ago from when he came out to my house .. I told her that I wouldn’t have saved something from that long ago -- she proceeded to tell me she saves everything for 7 years, I told her she is a better person than me then! She said I didn’t mean that then; she was just so nasty to me. So I left and called the 800 number and spoke to a gentleman who was very nice, he took care of the box and corrected the numbers on my account for me and then we found out that another problem with my account was as follows: When everything switched to digital we were sent a notice that said we needed a box for every TV. I called the 800 number and they told me that I could get 2 boxes at no charge for 1 year. Then normal charges would apply. Come to find out they have been charging me $8.90 per month for every box since July. I told him why I would go from paying nothing extra for the TVs which are in bedrooms to $8.90 per month each. He said it looks like they shipped out the wrong boxes; he could only go back and give me a credit for 2 months (about $36.00) but that is not fair to me. I am not an employee and how I am supposed to know they sent the wrong boxes. I mean they were mailed and I have to assume that they were correct. I have to be honest I never review the bill in detail because I don’t really understand it. To make the matter worse when I got home and hooked up the boxes the HD box did not work and now I have to go again and return it. I work almost 60 hours a week and when I m home I have family obligations of taking kids to sporting events and other things. I was told by the lady in the Comcast office that it must not be that important of I can’t arrange my schedule to have someone come out to the house? Many in today’s day and age she has the time, but I am never nor can I be home for 4 hours at a time to wait for the cable company to come out. She said what about Sundays --- I told her no not then either. I mean she is now questioning my schedule. Bottom line ~ I want my bill and cable fixed!"
1,"I keep loosing signal on these Xfinity boxes I was told I had to get. When I called for help, I keep getting disconnected on the phone. This is a breach of contract on their part and I am tired of it."
1,"I made an appointment with Comcast to set up a bundle pack. I asked the operator if I needed a TV during installation and she said no. When the tech arrived, he said that I did and that he couldn't do it without one. I own a second house 15 minutes away and asked him to wait in his truck while I run and get it and he said no, then walked out! I called back to make a new appointment and they said to go get my TV and that a supervisor would contact me back in 30 minutes.After waiting an hour, I called back and they said I would get a call in 30 minutes. After waiting another hour I called again and they said that the original tech would call me in 15 minutes. I told them that I did not want this tech as he was very rude to me the first time and just left without offering me any help nor did he attempt to make a new appointment with me and they said that a new tech would contact me.After waiting almost two hours I called again to cancel the whole thing. I then switched to AT&T who gave me a great package deal as well as a $50 gift card to say that they were sorry because Comcast was such a let down."
1,"We need to do something about Comcast. They just started pushing a scrolling marque across the top of the TV for anyone on basic cable who doesn't currently use one of their cable boxes. It stays there across the top of the screen and just repeats endlessly. The message says, ""If you can see this message, the TV you're watching isn't yet ready for Comcast's digital network enhancements. To order the necessary equipment, call 1-877-634-4434 or go to www.comcast.com/digitalnow to avoid service interruptions. Once you have digital equipment connected to your TV you will no longer see this message.""I obviously don't appreciate Comcast's heavy handed approach at forcing people to use their cable boxes. What I really don't appreciate, however, is Comcast's back door attempt at trying to get people to subscribe to their ""digital"" offerings so they can soak consumers for more money. This is extortion pure and simple. Consumers are being forced to pay for new ""features"" that they are not requesting."
1,"I did not receive notification that service was changing to digital in Indianapolis. I have not had any cable service for two weeks. I ordered the boxes and was told that they were easy to install. We spent an entire weekend trying to make these digital boxes work for our televisions. We had to visit the local store. We had to have a filter removed that Comcast had evidently placed on an outside line years ago. We made eight calls to Comcast on the telephone tree waiting endlessly and being transferred. One call was 86 minutes and 57 seconds on hold! We still do not have cable service.We were promised an 'emergency visit' yesterday and no one called or came to the house. We had to have someone waiting for that visit all day and no one even called to say that Comcast was not coming. Today, we had a scheduled visit at 3-5pm. It is now 4:45 and no one is here. I am so frustrated at this incredibly poor customer service. I feel like little David going up a giant, Comcast the corporate giant. Your recording keeps telling us that Rick from customer service wants us to have an exceptional customer service. That is so far from the truth. We have been loyal to Comcast for 25 years and spent over a thousand dollars each year for our service. I could not be more upset and disappointed with your company. Comcast has given us the worst customer service we have ever had in our lives! "
1,"I went to sleep this morning around 1:00 am to my favorite TV channel, only to wake up at 5:00 am and that very channel was nothing but ""snow.""  Since 2007, I have watched as Comcast has been consistently taking away cable services that I am paying for.  They never inform the customer that they are going to be taking away our channels.  We just wake up one day and they are gone.  I used to have many channels to watch and now, my family and I are reduced to around 13 channels.The only notices I have ever received from Comcast regarding their changes is their change in rates.  They love to make us pay more and give us substantially less.  I feel that this is unfair to all customers (including myself) who have service from Comcast that cannot afford anything else for their family to entertain themselves with.  I won't be the least bit surprised if one day, I fall asleep watching TV and I wake up and not having one channel to view while still paying for their services!  I feel that this is unfair business practices."
1,"First off, their attitude stinks when you call, they treat you like you're a moron.  Next, they send out idiots to fix the problem; nobody knows what they are doing.  They have music in their ears while working, or on cell phones making personal calls.  Then, they have cables that need upgrading and won't fix them, the TV has been scrambling, distorted sound, off and on pictures, broken up scenes, etc.  This has been going on for years, yet the price keeps going up.  Adelphia was better while this company is money hungry."
1,"I wanted to disconnect my cable service with Comcast and found Comcast made it difficult for you to do so. Comcast wanted customers to return the ""digital TV equipments"" before the service can be canceled. Your email and phone calls don't count. To begin with, the equipment (a TV box) was not requested by customers but forced onto customers by Comcast. Comcast warned the customers they had to use the box. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any TV signals. Now coming to the time you want to discontinue the service, Comcast wants you: (1) drop off the equipment at its service center which can be a long drive from your home, (2) mail the equipment in and you pay for the shipping cost and (3) Comcast picks up the equipment and charges you $10.99 for pick-up. After being over-charged by Comcast for months or years, you cannot escape from them unless you let them rip you off again. It doesn't make much business sense that the customer has to pay for something that he doesn't ask for in the first place. And the business has the final say if it will discontinue its service. We are not living under a Comcast dictatorship. We should have the freedom to decide when to stop doing business with it. It shows that Comcast is doing everything to rip off its customers."
1,"My neighbors called for cable service and Comcast showed up, dug 2 holes in my yard and when they finished they left a wire cable across my yard. I called and asked why they ruined my grass and left the cable across my lawn in the open. They said I would have to wait a week so they send someone to bury it. They could have run the cables across the house gutters like everyone else’s cable. It is a sloppy job and an eye sore in front of my home. My gardener will not be able to cut my grass because it is laid out across my yard! I am very upset at the disrespect to other’s property. They could have sent someone to bury the same day or rescheduled until they had someone to do the job right!"
1,"I recently had to view my bill online. I transferred my services from another physical property address last year. When I logged in to view my bill, I saw last year’s bill that showed the account paid in full. When I contact customer support, the employee should have taken care of switching my email address to the new account. Since they did not, I was reassigned another email which I have no knowledge of and do not have access to.Not to mention, that now not only do I have the inconvenience of not being able to access my email, I also cannot change my email address on other sites if I have forgotten the password because they will send it to the Comcast account that I can't access. I have stayed with this company due to the inconvenience of having to transfer my email address. Well, I might as well switch companies now that I have to set up all new account with every company I do business with online. It is extremely frustrating that I cannot access bills, accounts and emails. Lengthy amount of time trying to find and transfer email address when you no longer have access to the email account that you have used for years due to the fact that Comcast lost my address in cyberspace and cannot correct the issue. I think everyone should switch companies because Comcast personnel are not knowledgeable about their services or helpful to consumers."
1,"I have had Comcast for internet and cable since September 2008. I have been on time with every payment. It started with the first bill. There were 2 lines in the house already when we moved in. One line had to be installed or hooked up. We have been charged an additional $8.95 a month since then for this additional line. When I called and asked why and for how long, I was told forever, because it was an additional installation. Then one of the HD DVRs broke. They came and switched it out with a new one, and we're charged $20. I called and asked why when we are renting their equipment that I have to pay. It is their equipment that was faulty. They apologized, and I'm issued a credit and told if I purchase a service warranty for $20 a month, anything will be covered. I balked at this amount, and it's dropped to $3.99 a month.Then the modem started acting up. This happened about once a week. I called and was told to disconnect the cable and power for 15 seconds to reset it. I continue to do this for another year. I called whenever it didn't come right back and got told there's an outage or some reason. Finally, on one of the calls, I was told on their end that they can tell the modem is fried and schedule a tech to come and replace it. Tech came. It's replaced and worked OK for about 2 weeks, then it happened again. I called again and finally got someone who knows what they're doing. I was told it was not the modem and that from what he could tell in all the notes, it was the line. So he scheduled another tech to come and fix the hookup (that I was being charged the extra $8.95 a month for, no less). Since then, there's no problem with the internet.Now an issue with the replaced HD DVR. Descriptions in the guide do not show up, and the On Demand menu does not appear. I called, and they scheduled someone to come with a replacement. I waited, and no one came; so I called. I was told the dispatch was canceled on their end, because my account is past due (by 10 days) but that I can take the box in person and switch it out at one of the offices. I have waited to pay this bill until services were fixed, because I am tired of all the problems and am waiting to see if there aren't too many trees so I can have DirecTV instead. I vented to the CSR and said I at least would have appreciated notice that it was canceled. She issued me a credit.I have had ongoing problems with Comcast since the start. They overcharge for everything, nickel and dime everything, and have awful customer service. I pray to be able to switch to satellite!"
1,"We started service (telephone/cable/internet) on 2/27/2010 with Comcast. For some unauthorized reason, Comcast opened two (2) accounts with two (2) account numbers under our name. I called them as soon as I discovered this error. We received two (2) bills in the mail on the same day. They told me they would forward the information to the accounting dept. and it would take 5-7 business days until one (1) of the accounts would be completely deleted from their system. They informed me which account number to use. I also told them that I had made a payment already over the phone with my credit card.They discovered the payment got credited to the account that was to be deleted. They told me since the account was to be deleted, I would be mailed a check for the payment I made to them. I told them to just transfer my payment from the deleted account to the other account. They told me they could not do that. I also wanted to order a router. I was now told, because my account is showing up as ""past due account,"" I would not be able to place that order until my account was brought to current. I already made a payment! It was not my fault they applied my payment to the wrong account. There was no option on the automated phone system to choose which account to make a payment to. I was told by the installation guys that worked for Comcast that I could get a router free through Comcast but just pay $9.95 for shipping.I was quoted over the phone a $15 charge for the router but when I mentioned the price the installation guys gave me, they hesitated but told me that was correct. I received the check in the mail for the full amount I paid over the phone ($174). I've made two (2) payments (a total of $401) to Comcast since I started service on 2/27/2010. My bill every month should be $160. I can see my first bill being slightly high due to installation and new service charges but they keep sending me a bill for the account that was suppose to be deleted in 5-7 business days. It had now been almost a month! I called again to inform them about the whole mess up and I was basically told there was nothing they could do about it and I owe another $401! I asked to speak with a supervisor because they were not understanding what was going on and I needed to speak with management about this problem. I was placed on hold for five (5) minutes. The same person got on the phone and told me there was nothing they could do for me. I have all the names and  dates and times I spoke with people at Comcast. And I've gotten notices ""Make payment before service is shut off."" I'm going to be out $400 + because Comcast is double billing me."
1,"I previously had a Comcast service for $25 per month. A few month ago, all of a sudden our service was interrupted. I contacted Comcast and they told me that I had to upgrade my system which I did and I greed to pay about $36 per month. This month all of a sudden I received a bill for $67 from Comcast. The salesperson of Comcast specifically explained to me over the phone that the charge would be only $35. When I complained, I was told that I agreed with $67 after a few months. This is an outright lie by Comcast. I never agreed to pay $67 either implied or expressed. Shame on Comcast. Their conduct is unethical. I guess they do this without any shame or fear of Federal Trade commission. "
1,"I have been a Comcast customer since August 2008. I live in the 700 Grove condominium building which has a bulk subscription arrangement with Comcast. According to this arrangement, the maintenance fee that we pay subsidizes part of the total monthly subscription fee that residents of 700 Grove pay to Comcast on an individual basis. I was completely unaware of this until very recently. I spoke to a customer representative who was very helpful and mentioned that I had indeed overpaid from the time I started the subscription but she could only give credit ($ 357.48) for six months and informed me that that my monthly bill should be $32.90 instead of the $ 75.91 that I currently pay every month. I think this is very unfair as I have unwittingly been paying more than double of what I should have paid for the past 20 months. I should get full credit going back all the way since I started being a customer in August 2008 instead of the 6-month credit that I am being given. I am also quite disappointed because I think Comcast should have alerted me that I was overpaying as I was a resident of 700 Grove with which they have a special bulk arrangement. I would appreciate your prompt assistance and response in this regard. I have been over paying Comcast since August 2008 for the approximate amount of $903."
1,"My cable modem which I purchased from Insight Communications, the company Comcast took over from, stopped working. I had no way of knowing it was the modem because it was indicating as if it was trying to connect to the internet. A technician came and said that it was probably the modem. After buying a new one, all worked fine.Apparently, we were supposed to pay about $2 more per month for their ""Wire Service Insurance"" which makes no sense. It wasn't my fault the equipment stopped working. All, the technician did was test their cable system. Comcast, also jacked prices up. For a long while Insight prices were $40/month. It was so for a while as Comcast took over. Then they increased the prices in October to $42.95 without any reason for it.Now, they are jacking up prices again to $59.99 + ($1.99 for insurance) to some $60/month. That's a 50% price increase in less than a year and it is totally unfair and unreasonable. My main concern is with their shady practices, and not informing a customer about the service charge for anything. That's something I haven't agreed to."
1,"I signed up for the Comcast 3 bundled deal with a free netbook back in early August 2009, and till today I still have not received the free offer netbook Comcast promised. I called Comcast on 09/30/09 to follow up on the netbook, and they said have to wait for 3 months. I called again sometime in Nov 2009 and on 01/07/10. The rep still have no records regarding the netbook, and asked me to check on checkmyrebate which left me nowhere either, since the check rebate site always was showing ""no records"". So on 01/10/10, I called Comcast and the 800 numbers on checkmyrebate, and still none of the reps have a clue or have info regarding when I'll be getting the netbook. Today, it's almost May 2010. Yet, I still have not gotten the netbook and none of the Comcast personnel can help, nor have info, nor have a clue regarding this offer. This is really getting frustrating and annoying. I really feel I'm being cheated by the Comcast free netbook offer just to get people signed up with them with a 24-month contract that you cannot break. I really believe this is really not a good business practice for such a big company like Comcast, and I really do hope someone could help me solve this issue along with the rest of the people that are having the same or similar complaint about Comcast online. Thank you. "
1,"I was told in January that I wouldn't get a bill for 5 months after the service was activated and installed. I have had to call Comcast cable out to fix the installation and the reps told me that I would not only get the total install credited but also credits for other problems with my account. There are many calls to Comcast made by me because the credits weren't applied to my bill like I was told. I was also told today that with new service, they do not interrupt services until 3 months had past with nonpayment. I was told this because I complained about the bill coming in January when it was told to me that it wouldn't come until 5 weeks after the install on Jan. 2. So that would make the first bill come in February. My service is now turned off and this isn't the end of April yet. I have been making payment and the credits that Comcast has applied are also payments. So my service should still be on. I have been trying to resolve this Comcast turn off situation and I believe Comcast is at fault and my service should be immediately restore. I talked with Jennifer, who is a supervisor, today and she said that my bill for 4 months of service should roughly be $887.00. I asked her to calculate with me the amount that I had paid with the credits that she said she saw and then subtract that from the $887 for the 4 months service. $126 was paid on Feburary 12, plus $306.70 paid on March 12th and the credits that Jennifer said she saw was about $165.00.If you calculate all of that, it equals $597.70, subtract that total from the $887.00 that Jennifer stated is the roughly totaled charges for my 4 months and that leaves $289.30, which would be due in May not April. Per the only suspension letter I have ever gotten, it stated that if I paid the $306.70 by March 17 and it was received by no later than March 21, my service wouldn't be interrupted. As you can see, that payment was made on March 12. Please restore my service ASAP."
1,"I subscribed to Comcast DVR service about 2 years ago. Since that time, I've had to have them replace my box 3 times due to its problems. The last box they issued me last week will not record the last 30 seconds to 1 minute of any program I attempt to record. Often this is the most important part of any program. I just called, and their answer was ""Yes, that happens sometimes."" This is unacceptable, as it happens on every program whether it's a pre-programmed recording or if I just press the record button to get a program in process. I have been a Comcast customer for about 10 years and also have a business account with them as I'm a professional web designer. They take about $200 of my money each money, and this is the best they can offer. In my opinion, the big wigs sit up in some home office, raking in the bucks and don't care what the customer is experiencing. They ought to be made to do better. I will probably discontinue my service, buy a TiVo box, and subscribe to this service."
1,"I have been with Comcast for many years. I had a problem with a set-top box and tech support told me to swap it at their office. Not only was I given a non-functional device that I had to swap during a second visit, they told me my rate was going up more than $50 for the same services I have had for years. They told me that the rate I had been paying for years was incorrect and I would be required to pay at least $50 more per month. They have lied many times in the past and I think they are lying now. I continue to pay the old rate ($174.35) but I am afraid of retribution. Giants can be mean and vindictive. What can I do? Thank you. Although the services provided by Comcast are fine, their pricing is not competitive and I will be forced to reconfigure everything (at my expense) if they do not honor their earlier commitment."
1,"On three separate occasions, I waited for someone to come bury my cable. I had to be here because I have dogs in the backyard, which I explained to them. The first two times, the technician called me and tried to get me to come home from work because he didn’t want to work that late in the afternoon. He didn't show up for his appointment and then lied to Comcast and canceled my appointment.Then Comcast made another ""appointment"", this time it was a window from 8 am to 7 pm on a Saturday. I waited all day. Did they show up? They did not. Each time I called to complain, I would talk or ""chat"" with a customer service rep who would read the same useless apology from the same useless script.  Their ""chat"" customer service was awful. They were clearly using a script and had no idea what time it was here."
1,"Comcast is the most terrible cable service provider out there. I encourage everyone to go with Clear, Verizon, or any other service available. First, I did not realize that every time a technician came out to fix a problem that I would automatically incur a service charge. Why did I not think I would incur a service charge? Because the problem was Comcast's fault from the beginning. When I first chose Comcast as my service provider (which may change in about 2 weeks), I had a technician come out to install a cable. Unbeknownst to me, the technician proved to be incompetent and did not wire my house properly. Time passed, and my internet connection worsened. Thinking it was my router, I happily accepted a Comcast router (that I paid a $10 shipping fee which they neglected to tell me about). The problem stopped for a time. After some bad rainstorms featuring high winds, the problems began again. Thinking I could call Comcast for help, I decided to do so. They sent a technician out. He was a great tech, and he fixed my problem by re-wiring the faulty wire. He told me that the initial tech sent out had not done the job properly and so the wire had become loose through wind, rain, snow, etc. (you can imagine Philadelphia winters). So, in the end, I am paying an additional fee (that I am not happy about) for something that was not my fault to begin with. Thank you, Comcast, for your spectacularly terrible customer service."
1,"The salesperson stated there was no installation fee. Comcast then billed me a $99 installation fee. I communicated with 2 customer service agents who both said they would take care of it, but did not. The third agent (retention agent) stated they would not waive the fee. "
1,"I do not have service or account with Comcast. There's a service box in the right corner of my backyard.  This box is used to connect cable and phone service to the other three homes that is adjacent to me. I am a Dish network customer. I went out to look at what needed to be done to repair my gate on February 12, 2010.  While I was out, the meter reader for the gas and light was reading the meters. On February 13, 20010, the gate door was remove and repaired for the third time in 6 months and lock. On February 17, I was sitting at my desk and heard the gate swung open and close.  Somebody busted the gate open. The next day, I wired before the gate close. By Saturday, the gate was swinging open and closes again. My mother is their 24 hours a day. That Saturday, I ask my neighbor and mother, who entered the yard. They told me that Comcast was there three times that per week.I called Comcast about a repair and spoke to ** @ 9:4 am on the 1st of March.I called on the 4th and they said that will try to cancel our savings .  I called again on the 4th and they said that they will call in 48hrs. I called again on the 8th.  I called again on the 10th at 4:32pm and they gave the direct number to **, a claims representative. He never answers my calls.  On April 7, I spoke to ** but until now, I have not gotten a response about repairing my gate.One of the Comcast employees continues to enter my entrance gate to my backyard by force. My mother is home 24hrs."
1,"Comcast is encrypting channels and lying about how/when/why. They claim the FCC mandate required that they encrypt (i.e. scramble) channels like A&E, Food Network, USA, Comedy, History, etc. They are claiming I need to purchase/rent their descrambler equipment to receive channels which I pay for and which I have received for years. I pay for the ""extended channel line up"" which includes the above channels, and I am not able to receive these channels. When I called to complain about the lack of service, I have heard every ridiculous excuse, from ""sun spots"" to ""satellite upgrade"" to digital-to-analog FCC mandate, etc. Their DTA (descrambler) box negates the use of my new digital TV features such as picture-in-picture and HD signal quality. Since my TVs are digital, I neither need nor want their digital-to-analog converter (DTA) boxes. The nationwide announcement about the analog-to-digital signal conversion, stated clearly that consumers would need the converter box only if they had an analog TV on an antenna. Comcast required the converter box for any analog TV. This is far beyond the nationwide announcement. Now Comcast is claiming that I need a converter box (which I now understand to be a descrambler) regardless of whether my TVs are analog or digital. Most of all, Comcast has been very dishonest about what they are doing, claiming all of their requirements are actually a part of the FCC mandate. Note that when I tried Comcast's converter (DTA, descrambler) box on my digital TV, it caused my TV to receive 1 analog channel and 0 digital channels. I currently get less than 1/2 of the channels that I pay for and I get nothing but ridiculous stories from Comcast about why. I would think that A&E and Food Network, etc, would be upset to know that their viewing community has been chopped to pieces by Comcast's dishonest/scrambled service program. Please help."
1,"I’ve just discovered an additional charge on my bill for Comcast Performance Plus. When I signed up, the amount was supposed to be $42.95 a month but later they added this additional $10 fee for Comcast Performance Plus without even asking or telling me about it. The charge is hidden that when you have paperless billing, you can find it but you really have to dig for it."
1,"The serviced provided did not meet the advertised product. The company also disregards what they advertise and have you purchase, therefore making you spend money for nothing. I was overcharged for base services and had to buy other products listed on their website, and they will not acknowledge their mistake, nor credit my account."
1,"1st issue: I had Comcast internet from my work for about 3 yrs, then my job decided not to pay for our internet any longer. So, they gave us a choice between transferring the connection to our name or shutting it off and calling ourselves to turn it back on. I told them to transfer, but when they finally did it, it was in mid month and there was no email or regular piece of mail going out, notifying us of what speed we were paying for, what date it was transferred, anything. I got a bill saying that I owed $200+ for the first bill because my company didn't pay for the full month and I owed for a month and a half. So, I went back and forth, finally, saying that you can shove it because I was never told by anyone what I was supposed to pay. I mean you don't walk into a dealership and just say I want that Porsche GT4 without looking at the price, right?! So, I returned the modem and moved to another address.Issue 2: Comcast equipment retrieval department is calling me, saying I never returned the modem. Two months of this! The rep asks if I have my receipt. I said ""from what?! 2 months ago?... NO! "" I asked why they can't look up to see what the other Comcast reps can see because they said, I have no equipment still, under my last address and they said because we can't see their records... hmm. Now, that seems to me, that the equipment department should be the ones with the most recent data... am I crazy?! The calling continues....Issue 3: I got home and my bedroom television that I have set all the channels that it will get, is missing about 30 channels. This is in the new address that I moved in... So, I rolled my eyes and called 1800comcast and talk to this rep that told me that I'm gonna need a box to get those channels now. I said that""s **. I opened this agreement with the idea, that these were my channels, but no... he said that they've moved those missing channels to a digital package and I'll need a box, thinking I'm going to have to pay more a month for each box I get **. So, finally after raging this idiot he said ""Well, you can just go by the Comcast store and get ""as many as you need"" for your house"". ""As many as I need"", so I said ""okay"" and hung up. I just got back from the Comcast store today and you know what the lady behind the counter said?.. ""You can only have two, since your DVR is a box and a DVR is considered as 2 boxes and my plan only allows 4 boxes... sigh... So, I just said give me the ** boxes and took my happy ** in the car and drove back to work **.Bottom line, nobody at Comcast knows ** is going on. Nobody! They are a bunch of liars and I can't wait for the day that they have competition, because I'll be the first one to switch. By the way, this was over a 3 month period that I've been dealing with all of this. Physical damage was to my brain and all the time that I spent on the phone that I will never get back... I could've been having sex or scratching my **."
1,"Well, I've just got Comcast. Now, I wish I never did. Each time I called in for help, I got the runaround. I'm going to have to look up another telephone and internet service but come on now. if you cannot help a person, don't act like you know what you are doing and you don't. Comcast, don't do it. It sounds good, but it is not."
1,"Comcast breached my privacy and put my personal security at risk by setting up my home network as a public wireless network which was accessible by over 14 other computers in my immediate location and also published my phone number after requesting that it not be. I have asked to speak with a supervisor on 5 different occasions and have either been placed on permanent hold, hung up on or told I would get a call back which never happens. I am very concerned that they can be so careless with others privacy and security. This resulted in hours and hours of stress and possible identity theft."
1,"I moved from Novato to Santa Rosa. When I set up my Santa Rosa service and spoke to a rep by phone later, I was told they would use the same account number. This turns out to be false information. I made payments by electronic banking to the same (old) account number for 4 mos. with no problem. In March I got an overdue notice for 2 mos. service, then paid the overdue by electronic banking. They marked my account overdue nonetheless as it was paid to the old number. Only after repeated phone calls do I find out that in fact I have a new account number. They also did not send paper bills for the last 2 mos. or at least I have not received them. Today I found out after 20 min. on the phone with their collections dept. that they have sent me a refund check for the paid amount sent to the wrong acct. number, and so I still owe them. I paid this amount by credit card. I also asked about a promotion I should be eligible for, but I am told I am not eligible because my account is overdue. I work with Comcast on behalf of my clients and the universal sentiment is that they have no idea what they're doing. In my case now I have a record of not paying on time, which technically is not true as I did not receive a billing statement, nor did they notify me of the overdue for almost 2 & 1/2 mos. I have repeatedly tried to get them to send notices to my main email account (not Comcast account, but domain mail) and they say fine, we'll do that, but it never happens."
1,"On March 30, 2010, I paid my bill but meant to pay only the past due. The entire amount was paid. So I called and spoke to a very nice customer service rep from the Caribbean. I can't remember her name. She took my information and submitted my request for my bank account to be credited. On April 7th, I called to find out why my account had not been credited and she said that it was not yet. So I waited another week and I called today, April 14th, and I spoke with another rep. Never at any time when I spoke to a woman did she say that she was resubmitting the request for my refund. She then passed me off to billing because she couldn't give me an answer as to why my account hadn't been credited. So I spoke with another rep and he tells me that it is still sitting there waiting so he was doing another ""ticket"". I was none too happy then. I asked him, ""Why are you doing it now when it should have been done the first time, then the second time and now your doing it again? I asked for supervisor. He was clueless. He could not give me an answer. I told him that I wanted an answer as to why it has been two weeks and my account has not been credited. He could not tell me. I asked him why he could not call the billing dept. He said that the billing dept doesn't handle it. I asked him who did and why can't he call and find out what was going on. He said that that office is ""blocked"" and he could not call. He kept insisting that it would take 3-5 days from this date to get my refund and I insisted that it should have been done on the 29-30th. Why is it being done two weeks later? I have the ticket numbers and confirmation numbers if needed."
1,"I am forced to go with Comcast in our area as we don't have another provider. When I first moved into our home 8+ years ago we had AT&T cable and was very happy. They removed service from our area so I picked up the only provider in the area, Comcast. It has been one headache after another. They charge me for things they cannot even explain (one time fees). Their packages are filled with a bunch of junk channels with just a few you may watch and that's all part of the package which you pay for. My Comcast bill is always close to $150 for what amounts to basic channels. We have had a box in a separate room we are paying for that they have not been able to make work, one excuse after another. Isn't there a way to give people like me a choice? It's pretty bad when your cable bill is higher than your electric bill. They bundle packages together that forces you to pay a higher price for your cable. We should have a choice as to what we want to watch without being forced to pay for a bunch of junk!"
1,"Everyone was told when the digital conversion took place last year that we had to get rid of our old analog sets so we could view all but the pay channels. Now this year, Comcast comes back and says you will not be able to see anything but basic cable without one of their digital boxes. They gave us three but we have a large family and have to pay monthly for more. Just another fee for them to make money off of. Now we are paying for a service we can no longer watch on all our TVs throughout our home without paying Comcast's extortion money. More cost for cable TV. People in older homes having to load up receptacles to add on powered converters."
1,"I cannot give specific names because we have dealt with a number of customer service representatives and supervisors since August when we began service with Comcast again reluctantly due to not having another provider in our address.  We have had one problem after another with this company with constant hidden costs added to our bill, violations of our contract that to this day is not at the price we signed up for.  Comcast members give us numerous excuses every month why they charged us all these different costs. In the beginning, they made us sign a second contract because they lost the first one, thus, raising the price by a third of the cost.  We have numerous problems with the service; six technicians were later at our house and they gave us one excuse after another again as to why our service is still problematic. Our current issue is still a bill with overcharges which is still not at the contracted rate and a picture which is regularly freezing.  Their own technician stated that our problems now with viewing are due to the lines outside needing replacement.  The job needed to be completed in 48 hours due to it being a violation of some state code. A week later, after they asked us to give them access to our backyard to fix the problem, they have not done anything and when we call them, they stated that they have no record of this conversation by their own technician and supervisor even though their technician was at our home.  This problem has been going on for about a month and now they are telling us that they need to send another technician out to evaluate the same problem.  Basically, this is a repeat of what had already been done with no resolution.We are concerned that Comcast has formed a monopoly in service in this area and is often allowed to get away with very unethical practices.  We had Comcast a number of years ago and left their service due to similar billing and service issues.  It was to the point that I honestly considered getting an attorney.  We were stuck to use them again due to the company; we are not being allowed to have service in our area.  I have spoken with many other users of Comcast who reported very similar issues with no resolution.  What is a consumer like me supposed to do with a company that can get away with constant inconsistencies in what they say and do?  They overcharge people, they violate their own contracts and give every excuse as to why they can do that.Recently, they were charging people $8.00 for the box and if you wanted to use the box, an additional $7.50.  It is a hidden cost that most people would not understand that basically makes the user pay $15.50 for the box on each TV.  They are charging for the service, the use of the box, and the signal to the box.  It is a duplicate cost which brought them in millions of dollars.  We called them on it and were told by Comcast that they were no longer going to charge this and would remove it from our bill.  As in previous bills, the adjustment and credits have not been made.  Me and my husband have taken time off work to be here for their technicians who have not resolved the issues that we have.  We have continuously overpaid since August with not one correct bill since then.  I have been promised a credit that I am still waiting to see on my bill. "
1,"Comcast is dishonest! Within a couple of weeks after my triple-play ""promotional rate"" of $141 ended, I called them to see if there were any other promotions I could get on. I was told there were by a rep from their ""Customer Retention"" division. He told me he would put me on a $122 (and change) rate, and it would be effective as of the end of my promotional rate.I also got a letter from Comcast, 2 days after that call saying that ""as a valued customer"", I would be getting at $10 triple-play credit for as long as I maintained my current level of service, and a $25 ""valued customer"" credit on every bill for the next 12 months. Turns out the total $35 credit reduced the ""regular"" charges to, guess what--$122! I thought I was getting a ""deal"", but it was no deal because I was just getting the reduced bill for being a ""valued customer"".But when the bill came, it was for $157. Called Comcast and was told that I was not on any new promotional rate. IOW, the rep lied or was incompetent and did not put me on the new rate. I mentioned the letter I had gotten from Comcast, and guess what the rep said? ""That letter was sent to you in error!"" At that point, I exploded, which I rarely do on the phone. After that, she said (again) that I was switched to the new promotional rate. But when I accessed my bill online, it was still just short of $157.Talked to another rep and was told that my new bill was $113.28. I asked if that's true, why does it still show $156 and change when I access it? She said the credit would show on the next bill. Bull feathers! As as result of this exchange, I terminated my auto-pay, which I've had for many years, to prevent Comcast from taking more out of my bank account than they're due. I instead sent them a check for the $113.28, which they cashed a couple of days ago and my account now shows a balance of $127 and change. In addition to the credits I was supposed to get, I had called a Comcast technician to investigate a problem with our TV reception. He arrived late, and told me there would be a $20 credit on my next bill. No such credit ever showed up."
1,"I have a bill 594. I put in mail for 500. They are saying that they never got it. I am SSI, so I only can send one payment a month. I did not even pay my rent because of this bill. The bank is doing a trace on the money order. Please help us. I can send a payment May 1 for 500."
1,"Contacted Comcast customer service option ""downgrade or disconnect service"". When greeted, the customer service agent quickly began quoting to me that the law required this or the law required that very matter-of-factly. The last thing I wanted to have was a lecture from a twenty-something little twit that has no clue what she is talking about, but simply gone through her 3-day training seminar at Comcast. Bottom line: I have moved out of state, will not continue service, nor do I plan on paying for a contract they say exists but cannot find a copy of a signed document. Suffice it to say I will not do business with Comcast ever regardless if I have no other options."
1,"I scheduled cable service to be installed around 9-12 on a Tuesday morning. No one ever called or showed up between those times. I called Comcast to find out what happened and the rep said the tech noted that he could not find my location. I asked why he didn't call me and she replied that he did and I did not answer which I thought was strange as I had the phone next to me all morning and I made no calls and no other calls came in. The rep said she sent an email to dispatch to try to get someone out to me and would call me back in 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, still no call.I called back and the rep said that dispatch had not responded and she would call me back in another 20 minutes. At this point, I am getting furious as I am wasting my whole day waiting for the tech. She said she could reschedule my appointment and I stated that I should not have to do that as I already had an appointment that the tech did not service! She said the only thing I could do then was wait for dispatch. Finally, at 4:30 in the afternoon, a tech shows up to install my service and he did not even have the correct equipment. I had ordered two DVRs and he brought one regular digital cable box! He said I would have to make another appointment to get the DVRs that I ordered. Absolutely, I’m just fed up. I called and made another appointment for today 9-12. Surprise, surprise, no one showed up and no one called.I called Comcast to find out what happened this time and he informs me that there is no appointment scheduled on my account! Seriously?! This is such poor customer service! These people have no idea what they are doing! If another service provider was available to me, I would change companies. Unfortunately, Comcast is the only provider for my location. If I want cable I am stuck with Comcast! So as of now, I have another appointment for tomorrow. I asked the rep to send me a confirmation letter for my appointment to my email. He said that their system wasn't capable to do that. Are you kidding me? So I say, “Okay, can you just give me a verbal appointment confirmation number then?” I got the reply of no to that as well. Honestly, I don't know how Comcast stays in business! As for my appointment tomorrow, I won't hold my breath! "
1,"We had been long time Comcast customers who always paid on time. However, we were traveling overseas and had difficultly getting payments to Comcast. We missed their notices of late payment. When we did pay the amount in full on our return, Comcast had disconnected our services and released our telephone number of 14 years. They could not restore the number for us as it was ""out of the pool."" "
1,"Comcast cable would not fix my cable, out of service for a long time. Supervisors need to do a good job. Misael supervisor is not solving my problem. I have no cable for over a week and none available to come out."
1,"Comcast Local Edition Program segment doesn't cover my area where I live and doesn't represent a DSN (Distant Market Network). It interrupts HLN channel at an inappropriate cut off. When Comcast Local Edition isn't on, it cuts into HLN last segment program two minutes after it started because of Comcast local commercials. HLN denies that Comcast should do the cut in late into their segment shows and denies they should do Comcast Local Edition. Loss contracts of other residents to Satellite. Local channels by Comcast requires a converter box. Comcast also dropped local channels in my area and we have in result higher cable bill. "
1,"I was calling to let them know about a problem with my bill, a charge of a movie that I did not order. After contacting the Augusta, GA office, this customer service person named KC was rude and told me to shut up and listen and let him finish his sentence and proceeded to call me a liar and say I ordered the movie. First of all, I have been a loyal customer with Comcast for many years. Second, I am in customer service myself and would never treat a customer in this manner. I spoke with a supervisor, William and he was not any help either. They created my account but stated they could never do that again and would note it on my account. *** people. You could tell by my account I never ordered any movies for money. I only watched free movies, period! I think it is time for people to go back to the basics of customer service. Learn how to treat a customer. And to all you, young people, without customers, you have no job and no paycheck! "
1,"The television freezes up. Internet service does not work, on demand does not work correctly. Service technicians have been here several times in the past eight months, but problem returns hours after they leave. When I go to use on demand it does not work, and if it does it will not work for 2 hours straight. comcast has done nothing but increased my bill to $190.00 per month and then they critize me cause its working when they arrive. when i call about it they make me go thru the same procedure of resetting the box etc. that takes about an hour, but no results."
1,"I have been harassed by Comcast and threatened to have my internet disconnected for supposedly too much internet usage.  They shot an obscene number of gigs which they are claiming my family uses more space that my hard-drive even contains.  I was told when I signed up for Comcast that there was no limit to downloading and just for the record, I do not download anything illegal.  If I download something it's because I payed for it or I download virus protections and software updates.  When I asked to have this sent in writing, they completely denied me.  They said that they don't send that stuff out!  If they are not sending their customers download limits, then how are we supposed to know?  They told me whether or not I pay for it, they don't allow it.  Isn't that a breach of contract under Comcast's fault? I use my computer for business purposes the majority of the time and I have a disabled child that is computer dependent because of severe handwritten skills; he needs the computer.  Comcast and their phone operators did not wish to comply with my requests at all.  What can I do and what are my rights?"
1,"Back on March 15, 2010, I spoke to a CSR named Diana via the internet on Comcast's website to address the issue that Comcast sent me a letter threatening to disconnect my services. She was to have made a notation on my account that a payment would be made on my account on March 20, 2010 and there would be no disconnection. There was never no disruption in my services and they promised payment was made on said day in the amount of $50.I then received my bill (billing date 3/20/2010) with a late payment fee and a reconnection charge. I called Comcast on April 1, 2010 and spoke to a supervisor named Brandon and he claimed that my services were disconnected on March 20, 2010 and have not had service since said date. I told him that there was never a disruption in my service and that I wouldn't be talking to him because I have VOIP. I said that I would like the reconnection fee and late payment charge removed. He refused and still claims I have no service. I have documentation that they still bill me for services they claim are disconnected. I have a copy of the chat I had with CSR Diana on 03/15/2010 and I have a receipt of my payment for 03/20/2010."
1,"I am told that while a Comcast installer was installing in my upstairs neighbor's condominium, he entered my condominium while I was not home and without permission.  I was told this by the neighbor who was having equipment installed.  I see no evidence of any damage.  It is just that this is a gated community and I resent anyone taking such liberties."
1,"In July 2009, my 'special package' rate that was initiated one year earlier expired. My monthly rate for cable and phone services shot up. I called the company and was set up with a new package price for the same services. I was satisfied with the conditions of the new package and told that i must agree with a 10% increase in July of 2010, in order to get the new package rate. I agreed and signed an agreement letter and returned it to Comcast.Six months later, I received a bill with a retroactive charge that amount to a significant amount of money, as well as an increased monthly rate. I called and over several hours of conversation and email, I was told that Comcast would resolved the issue, but was having trouble finding the right 'package' price to suit my need. They indicated that the original pricing was incorrect. As i continued to receive increased bills, I was told that they were still working to resolve and adjust the rate.Then, after a period of time with no further response or reduction in the bills to my agreed-upon rate, Comcast changed their tune and told me that they would not honor the agreed rate. not only did they raise the rate but plan to continue to increase the new rate by 10% in July 2010. I feel that they didn't honor their agreement and still expect me to pay the increased rate in the annual increase. I would like them to adjust my bills to the agreed upon rate. My monthly bill is now 17 dollars/month higher, and the 10% increase in July will be based on the higher rate."
1,"ComCast was out puttering in the box on my property months ago, trying to fix a neighbor's service problems. When they do this, they never knock on the door and say that the service will go out on a temporary basis. It's just gone. Everything: phone, Internet and TV. After this event, we started to have intermittent problems.On the phone almost every day, resetting Internet modem. Then it was claimed that the computer modem was going bad. They won't send one in the mail. This is their own equipment but they won't bring another one and install it without a service charge, and they won't send one in the mail for self-installation without a service fee either. I have to drive to the local office, 20 miles round trip on my gas, to get one. Well, that didn't fix anything, certainly not the TV and not the Internet either.Now, the nearly daily service calls start, ""The problem is not in the house. It's in the box. I'll get maintenance out to fix it. You won't have to be home. No charge."" Maintenance comes, who supposed to call first, but doesn't. ""You weren't home so I left."" Another technician is scheduled. ""Oh, the first guy got it wrong -- you've got a loose wire here in the house on your connection to the wall socket and I'll put this new connector on. No charge. Oh, and I'll give you a credit because the guy who was here earlier got it wrong. All fixed now."" No, it isn't, same problems an hour later and a $30 charge on the bill because the fix is said to be my fault. I spent an hour on the phone to get that reversed.Next technician appointment: ""I'm calling because you have an appointment. It's working right now? Oh, then it won't help for me to come -- can't help you if it's fine right now. Call when you have trouble again."" Call goes out two hours later: it's down again. ""We don't have anyone available until next week and you'll have to be home. Sorry about that. Call us again and ask for a credit when it's fixed.""Wait again for someone to come. ""Oh, there's nothing wrong in the house, the problem is in the box. I'll call maintenance and you won't have a service charge."" Yeah, that's what the service guy a month ago said. Maintenance shows up: ""The connector is broken in the box -- gotta get you a new one. We don't have the part with us. We will be back."" Four days later, someone is back. Finally the intermittancies stop.Check the bill: there's a $30 service charge on the bill for that fix. Meanwhile, charges for monthly TV service just doubled: whatever plan we have been on has expired. There's been no improvement whatsoever in TV service but the fee is now doubled and for the past several months, since the intermittancy started, the TV has been out along with the phone and the Internet whenever the broken piece in the box wiggled enough when the wind was blowing to interrupt the line.""Oh, I apologize for the charge and I'll take it off. Service charges are automatically billed to the customer unless the service tech files an invoice after the call which adjusts the automatic charge. Guess he didn't do that in this instance."" Come to find out: part of the pay for the service techs comes from the amount of money the tech can charge off to the customer on problems which are said to be the customer's problems. So the guy who claimed we needed a ""new"" connector at the wall was a liar: claimed the problem was a loose connection at the wall when it was, all the time, in the box outside. He was trying to find any possible reason to make the customer pay so he made up something to claim the problem was with the customer's equipment he got paid more in his paycheck for saving ComCast money by lying and blaming the customer."
1,"We thought our family could enjoy Vonage, with our 5gb Verizon Internet; but was told, they would have to set us up with Comcast cable Internet, whom they worked with! We sure are thankful we did not cancel the Verizon USB727-5gb-Internet. Comcast's hook-up caused E's Alarm System plus, all 5-AT&T land-line phones through out our home to shut down. We did not to realize that Comcast, was that dumb ! On March-01-2010 (took 21 days to get my AT&T,+ alarm back ) when Comcast walked away, the only 1 phone our family had was a poor reception phone in our out back computer room, requiring their Internet left on. What a nightmare!  Now it looks like Comcast-Cable wants to bill $64.52, the family for their nightmare, called for by Vonage ! We should go on line & warn 23 million vets! "
1,"I cancelled my service with Comcast, then returned my digital boxes. They came to my home and called several times asking for the boxes, although they have verified that they received the boxes. They then sent me bills. I called 7 times and each time they verified they owed me $7.26 and that they agreed that the service was cancelled and the boxes returned. They then sent a collection agency a notice stating that I owed them $45.80.They concur this was their error and corrected by refusing to send me the money that they owe me. They called me and  wanted me to change back from DirecTV to Comcast, One word is my answer, never! They are beyond incompetent. They have caused me lots of wasted time and owe me $7.26. They have sent me to a collection agency even though they verify that they owe me money and I owe them nothing."
1,"I am sending a complaint because I feel that I have been treated very badly by Comcast.  I was advised by a supervisor, Devon **, that I would receive a call from him on 3/24/10, between 7:00 and 7:30pm.  He never called.  This was after repeated requests to speak to a supervisor on several occasions over the poor customer service in both the billing and tech support departments.I am a new Comcast Cable customer, and was installed on 3/10/10.  Until today, I had very poor, if any reception or connection, and also my phone service, which I switched from Verizon to Comcast also was experiencing problems.  One of the tech support technicians said that I may receive a free premium channels if I would ask.  He also said, ""Be careful not to trip again over the exposed cable line that he installed outside.""  Then the billing department doubled my bill.  I was also told to continue paying my bill regardless, and it was doubtful I would receive any promotional free premium channels as a consolation.  Thank you for your attention to this matter."
1,My wife Marie ** called Comcast a week and a half ago to get cable and internet access for our house. The internet seems to be not working and the person that came here that day from Comcast was not very helpful and did not offer to connect the internet or cable for me. I would greatly appreciate it if someone from Comcast could come by our house to see what the problem is as I need the internet for my work. I would very thankful if someone could contact me about this matter. Thank you.
1,I ordered the Comcast triple play for $99 a month. I have had the service for 8 months for a total of $792. I have paid them a total of $1082 and still owe $584. That is more than double the advertised price of $99 a month. The service was shut off without cause.
1,"I have had Comcast service for years and recently in their home page area, I have stock portfolios that take about 1-2 hours to enter in their financial section. Recently, the portfolios have disappeared and required re-entering by me. At the same time, elsewhere on the home page, there is a place for weather at a specific zip code. I enter 95014 for Cupertino and after a few days, it switches of its own accord to Philadelphia. I am tired of re-entering my data. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with people in Mexico who sent me to the wrong people and initially told me that whenever Comcast worked on the system, I would lose my data and later a supervisor told me that the problem was not with Comcast but with my computer. It takes me 1 - 2 hours to re-enter the stock data and if Comcast can't improve their service and accept responsibility, I will go to AT&T."
1,"I originally came to this site to complain about MSN and/or My MSN changes but then found the Comcast complaints. I have never had a problem like any of the described issues in this thread. As a matter of fact, one tech that visited our home suggested that we sign up for a ""special"" they were running -- one year and only $.99 per visit. After this expired, I was able to negotiate another year for $1.99 each visit. Since we live in an older home, this has been well worth this small fee.I don't know if anyone has ever used ""Customer Retention"", but I use it every time our contract comes up for renewal. And did you know that if you see an advertisement for something even better, call them, ask nicely, and you might just get the new ""special"" and even extend it for one year. We have the triple play package right now and yes, the phone service isn't as good as Verizon. The tech admitted that to me but I have to say, it's getting better and better. We still kept our Verizon cell phones as it's the best coverage in our area.When we were having trouble installing the Apple Time Capsule (with a PC), I called the Comcast computer support number and asked if he could offer any suggestions. He went above and beyond and walked me through the whole process (even said ""now you're writing all this down, right -- several times).Yeah, we pay more than we think we should, but our only other choice in our area is Verizon Fios. In the community where we live, satellite dishes are prohibited so that's not an option. I can live with the small problems we have with the HD boxes since it usually just involves a re-set. Their new billing method is easy to read and understand. I've found that when I do have to call them, the nicer I am, the more cooperation I receive. I don't ever call any company with a complaint when I initially receive the bill. Giving myself time to review the issue(s) and have my facts straight means they usually treat me with the respect I deserve as a consumer. If they don't, then I nicely ask if this call could be recorded starting immediately. But that's just me. To begin, the way you go about making your complaint sets the tone for the ultimate outcome. Documentation is an absolute necessity."
1,"We subscribe to Comcast Internet. Recently they have sent emails to our account to download their Norton Virus software and to uninstall the current McAfee software. I followed the 4 step procedure to discover that Windows 2000 is not supported. As a result, I no longer have any anti virus s/w running on our PC since one of the 4 steps was to uninstall McAfee. After many phone calls, I was advised that my PC was ""too old"" and I needed to purchase an upgrade. If this was the case, I would never have uninstalled McAfee in an attempt to install Norton. Comcast has recommended Norton, but now claims it is up to me to purchase additional products. I can no longer use our PC for internet access. I no longer have any virus protection software on our PC and can no longer connect to the internet unless I purchase a Windows upgrade at my expense."
1,"For months, we were bombarded with TV ads and countdown clocks that said TV was going from analog to digital. If we had TVs that were cable-ready hooked up with a coax cable, we did not need to do anything. Everything was fine. I didn't need to do a thing. Now, I have received a letter from Comcast that I will need to get DTAs (digital transport adapters) for all my sets. I will get one digital cable box and two digital adapters free of charge, since I will need one additional adapter. It will be $1.99 per month. I must do this by April 13 or I will lose stations 24-69, since they are now going digital. What? I thought that is what already happened!On March 16, I picked up the required equipment. We hooked everything up and called for activation as required. Bam...I lost all HD channels. We called Comcast and were informed that we will need to get HD boxes. The first one is $7 per month, and each additional is $13.99 per month. I pay $68.48 per month for extended Basic cable. The additional cost would bring my monthly bill up to $117.45. How is this even legal?We were told by Comcast that we do not pay for the channels. We pay for the equipment. Really? If I don't rent their equipment, I will lose channels. Just seems like another cable ripoff to me. I buy HD TVs and cannot enjoy them, unless I pay Comcast for the privilege. What do you think, and can anything be done to stop this? When stations first went digital, the government gave out coupons to the people who could not afford new TVs to help defray costs. Now Comcast has found a way to undermine that. I am on a disability, awaiting a lung transplant. I certainly cannot afford my cable bill to almost double, just so I can actually enjoy the HD TVs I paid for. Something has to be done to stop this. "
1,"Comcast insisted on sending a tech to verify a strong signal at the cable end inside the house. She said it was at no charge, she claimed it was for free. After the visit I was charged and supervisor of customer service said that I had to pay. As of today, I keep getting phone calls about paying the fee and account is now delinquent. Every single customer rep has an attitude and do not want to help anyone. They talk over you and do not show any concern for your situation."
1,"Comcast switched my service from HD Plus bundle to Economy without my permission. When I called them to ask them to fix it (03/06) and spoke to Vicki, she said she would have to send my problem to escalation because she didn't know why that had happened and that someone would call me back later that same day. When no one called by 03/15, I sent an email to Comcast and was told by Jason that ""I understand that you would like to speak to a Customer Care Specialist via telephone; however, Online Customer Care Specialists communicate solely through electronic communications.""So I called again today 03/16 and spoke to Nicole. I was on the phone with her for over an hour, and she said the only thing she could do to make sure I was billed at the $119 rate I signed up for was to switch me to a similar promotion, but it would end in March 2011 instead of July 2011. She said they have no way of switching me back to my original plan as it is gone from their system. "
1,"Comcast doubled my bill. Upon complaint, I was offered Triple Play to which I agreed. For the installation appointment, 3.5 hours wasted. I called 10 minutes after they missed the 2-hour guaranteed window. I called back, he said he was at my door, untrue! The next caller admitted that they could not reach the installer who showed up hour later with wrong service order! I had him survey house anyway, only to be told that installation could not take place as ordered and verified on phone, and that I had to provide a shelf for the ""black box"". Comcast, if you care, rdr91-americaline. Other wise, take a hike! It's 4 hours away from work. I was told lots of lies. There's higher cost of service to maintain the status quo with no installation."
1,"Comcast has recently been announcing that some of their channels would be changing to all digital formats. These channels would be unavailable if you do not have a digital converter. A decision was made to upgrade to digital preferred service. The appointment was made. Automated confirmation was received on the day before the appointment and on the day of the appointment.No one showed up within the time allotted although, someone called when time period ended and stated that the technician was running late. Five (5) hours later, there was no tech, no call and no notification of any kind. We found out later that night that Comcast had changed the appointment to three days later. When contacted, they stated that they would were trying to find out what happened to the tech and would send one right out. Yeah right. Eleven (9) hours later, still no tech. We have experienced some of the worst service imaginable in the DC area from Comcast yet, they monopolize the region. Do not choose Comcast if you can avoid it. "
1,"I am, at this point, so frustrated and angry at Comcast that I don't know where to start. I've been a Comcast customer for many years (about 10). I think and while I've been bombarded with Verizon FiOs ads and reps coming to my house, I've remained with Comcast. But in recent years, it has been my observation that Comcast is its own worst enemy. And my experiences of the last month may have been the straw that will cause me to switch to Verizon as have virtually all of my neighbors.For the past year, ending 2/27/10, I've been on a triple play promotion, paying $140 every month. Knowing that my next bill would jump to the full price, I called Comcast in early March to see if there were any new promotions I could get on because I had no intention of paying more than what I had been paying for the past year. After a discussion with a rep from the ""Customer Retention"" section, I was told that I would now be on a plan costing $122 and change plus taxes and fees, which would put my next bill at something around $130 which was fine.Within two days of that discussion, I received a letter from Comcast (not a flyer, a letter addressed directly to me) with the header: ""An exclusive thank you for being one of our most valued customers. Including a new monthly discount."" The discounts described in the letter were a $10 Triple Play Rewards Credit and a $25 Valued Customer Credit, for a total monthly credit of $35 for the next 12 months as long as I maintained my current level of service. Subtracting the credits from the regular $157 price results in the same $122 that the Customer Retention rep gave me, which I had thought was a ""deal"" but turns out he was only giving me the same total discount that Comcast was telling me about via the letter. But no problem.Then about 10 days ago we were having trouble with our TV service (tiling, sound drop-outs) and called for a technician to investigate. He arrived late and informed me that as a result, I would get a $20 credit on my next statement. So I expected to see a total bill of around $110, including taxes and fees, for my first off-promotion bill. I have been on auto-pay for years, and happened to check my checking account online this morning. To my shock, I saw that Comcast had taken $136.93 from my account for this month, which means that without the $20 late technician credit it would have been about $157. I immediately called and talked to ""Ruth"" in Customer Retention.I told her about my discussion with another rep a few weeks ago saying that my next bill would be for $122 (excluding taxes and fees) and the letter I had gotten from Comcast giving me $35 in credits for the next year, which would also have taken the bill down to the same $122. The first two things she said after looking up my account was that (a) I had not been put on any $122 plan, and (b) (this was the real shocker!) the $35-credit letter had been sent to me in error! At that point, I lost it, telling her in no uncertain terms that Comcast was a liar and that I wanted the company to credit me the $35 I had been promised. However, given this most recent experience, I don't believe anything a Comcast rep tells me, so I have removed auto-pay from my account settings so that I can control what I pay. Whether or not the $35 credit I was promised by the rep I talked to weeks ago and in the letter from Comcast, I will pay only the $122 plus fees and taxes. And if I don't get the credit for having overpaid for March, I will deduct that, too. If Comcast has a problem with what I pay, I'm off to Verizon! If you're thinking about getting Comcast, better think again."
1,"Service and confusion reign supreme at Comcast.  After hours on the phone in December and January and I was told I needed to upgrade, my underground services stopped when the services went digital in early March.  After a commitment in January, a person at Comcast told me since my construction commitment was older than 30 days, someone had to come to the house again for the 4th time to decide if there is a problem.  It appears to me the problem is Comcast and this is not the first time and state I have had a similar issue.  The cost to run this company has got to be ridiculous and passed on to the consumer.  Fios is not available and Frontier is not in the game.  No choice would be better than the frustration of dealing with Comcast."
1,"I recently decided to change to Comcast internet after a bad experience with Qwest. I already have Comcast cable and besides being overpriced, I have little bad to say. However, when I called to place an order for a new internet account with Comcast, the rep offered promises but did not deliver in any way, shape or form. I placed the order on 03/01 and advised the rep my Qwest service would be canceled as of 03/12. He assured me all items needed such as cables and the modem would be delivered by then. With well over a week to do so, how could this have gone wrong? Of course, I never received anything. When I called back, they admitted it was their fault and that the order did not even go out. They could not have anyone bring it to me even though there are several offices in my area. I could either wait another 2 days for delivery or I could got to them to get the equipment and install myself. Well, I personally do not think I should have to waste my time for a mistake they admitted was theirs. When I advised to cancel the order, there was no further attempt to remedy the situation. They were quite content to not have my business. I will also be canceling my cable television asap. My advice to anyone who reads this: If you have any other alternative to Comcast or Qwest in you area, go with it. Avoid these companies like the plague. They are the typical large corporations that couldn't really care less."
1,"Comcast reported in their TV advertisements, in 2008-2009, that cable subscribers would not need a digital TV converter ,as they would continue to broadcast in analog. Now that government vouchers are no longer available, they are converting all to digital and require us to rent converters from them. They allow 2 free, and charge for any additional. I have 6 TVs, and now must rent from them. A classic case of bait and switch."
1,I was charged a $30.00 NSF Fee for online payment. I use auto-pay and always have a cash reserve to cover my bills.
1,"I recently moved to an area with Comcast cable turned on. Everything went right as planned till after a month after I moved in. I got a bill that said I owed about 450.00 dollars from 8 years ago. I have never had Comcast and have lived at my last address for 11 years. When I called, they said that there was nothing I could do that it was my bill when they finally told me about the bill it was not even in my name!Just SS number so they told me that if I took in proof of where I lived and my state ID they would get it off my account. Now let me tell you this was 3 months ago and now my cable is off and I'm still being charged a monthly bill! So I called everyday and get the same answer that they will have to have someone else call me back and let me tell you I call 3 times a week and still have not heard anything! So what am I supposed to do? I have lost cable TV and still being charged for it and it's on my credit, even though I have gave them everything they asked and showed them that this account was not even in my name. How can they charge me for it?"
1,"I have been calling and requesting a copy of the change work order performed in June 2009 since 08/2009. I have been told by 6 different times I would receive a call back with resolution and to date have not. Comcast upgraded and changed my cable without my request or consent. They have ignore my several attempts to rectify the situation. My last message from Naomi (ID#9KI) stated that now too much time has passed for the company to credit my account. It was Comcast and solely Comcast that let time come in the way. Overcharged consumer. Taken advantage of the the customer, very unprofessional business practices."
1,"I was told by another customer service agent that my bill should be no more than $102 including tax. Marlene has told me it should be $104 including tax which comes out to $110 and that my bills has never gone up. I asked her if she would bring up the last six months of bills and show me the charges. She refused to do this saying I should have copies which I have thrown away. She said she only has to show me 3 months. She was extremely stubborn and would not let me talk to a manager. When I got angry, she finally said she would have someone call me back within 4 hours. I would like to transfer to a new company but Comcast has a large fee that I would have to pay if I cancel before 2 years are up. I can't trust them at all and should not have to stay with the company or pay their fee if I cancel. I have superb credit and I should not have to put up with all of this."
1,"Our service was turned off with no prior notification. We have only had this service for 2 plus months and have paid a total of $220 for a service that is only supposed to be $49.99 a month. They bill one month ahead and still had the audacity to discontinue our service. I have phoned them several times with no satisfaction whatsoever.When Comcast installed our cable, they drilled a hole through our new wooden floor without our permission, and then they filled it with a big ugly glob of caulking. Also, the installer broke a $200 Armini statue that cannot be replaced."
1,"I am absolutely furious with Comcast. They will not tell you this but they are ripping all of us off! I found out today from a technician of Comcast who called me to cancel the appointment I had scheduled because I have been having that resetting problem with both of my DCX3400 boxes. It happens to me about 10-12 times a day and the guide never comes back up. All it says is to be announced! The tech told me that it is a hardware and firmware problem that Comcast is having and they have had this problem for months! Can you believe it, months?! Yet, you still have to pay your bill even though the service is not there, and no one, if you call or talk to Comcast representatives online ever knows whats going on. The tech said they do know about this problem and are supposed to tell us and credit our accounts for all the months of service we have not had but they are playing dumb and scheduling appointments anyway. They didn't even tell the technicians what the appointment I had scheduled was for? When the guy called me, he had to ask what the problem was and when I told him he immediately stopped me and told me that he was canceling the appointment because this problem can not be fixed. They are trying to fix it but it is a firmware & hardware issue so there is nothing they can do. Comcast needs to notify their customers and refund our money for the lack of service! Oh, and by the way, if you had called to complain about this several times and the reps did not note your account, then say you call again and complain, they will only credit you from the day that one of the reps who actually did their job and noted the account. For instance, I called several times over the past few months and no one notated the account until I spoke to a guy on the web on March 4th. So, they are saying they will only credit from March 4th to today March 10th, even though they know it has been going on for months and they can't fix it so it's going to continue to happen! I asked for a Supervisor and still they will do nothing! Who knows how long this will continue but does that mean I have to call every single month to make the reps note and credit the account for the lack of service? I guess so if you want your bill credited! The supervisor even admitted it. The last time I contacted Comcast was 10/23/09 for this problem (and was told then that I cannot get a credit until the issue is resolved; I had to call back again once it was resolved to get the credit) but since I didn't call every month to tell them it still wasn't working, they will not credit me. She even told me again when she scheduled the appointment that she cannot give credit even now because the issue has not been resolved. It's the same thing I was told before, you just can't win! But she will give me a credit for the missed appointment today of $20. I pay $237 a month for service that I don't get! This makes no sense! "
1,"Comcast have been charging me for the past 4 years for a piece of equipment that I do not have, a modem and a cable box, that I never had. I had made several phone calls complaining about this situation and I was told that a technical service representative will come, but he never showed up, so I decided to cancel the services and return the two HD cable box that I had. Now they are charging me $543.54 for unknown reason and threatening to destroy my credit if I do not pay this bill in 30 days."
1,"The channels they advertise are not what you get.  Furthermore, they never sent us any warning that they were going to eliminate channels from my package, so when I called them to find out on Friday night, the operator explained that he would reboot my cable box and all should be fine within minutes.  However, it did not work.  I called back on Saturday morning, but the operator I spoke with explained that they conducted an audit on the week of 3/1/2010 and decided to take away certain channels from my package. Comcast did not warn me of this and their webpage link reflects that they actually offer more channels for my packages than what I have actually been receiving these years.  On Saturday, they were going to look into this and respond by 11AM that morning, but I never heard back.  I called them again this morning and they responded by saying that if I wanted the eliminated channels, I would have to upgrade my packages.  I alerted them to the advertised channel packages listed online and explained that I never got all that's on this webpage list.  The operator said that the Web site is wrong and that if I want to upgrade, it would cost an additional $29.95 per month.Does this sound like ""bait and switch"" or ""false advertisement?""  Please help me and the possible millions of others that are taken advantage of by Comcast and their policies.  I wonder if they are changing their website as we speak.  I printed what they say to print for the channel line-up packages."
1,"I have been trying unsuccessfully to get Comcast service where I live. I have been told that there was a block put on this address and that is why I cannot receive cable service. My son is the one who has an outstanding bill with Comcast (he even has Comcast cable at this new address and if it is not in his name, then it is being done illegally by using another person's name). I have talked to several customer associates at Comcast to resolve this matter and get this block removed from my address so that I can get Comcast for myself under my name (I did have Comcast myself in the past and did pay my bills). Please, can someone help me? I just want to receive Comcast service and I do not feel that it is right to penalize me for the actions of anyone else even if that person happens to be my son! It is just not right. I do pay my bills so why should I be penalized?I have done all that I can do. I have given your people at Comcast Henry's current address so that you can pursue collection of the debt that he owes you. I have even given you information that you can use to check and see for yourself that he is getting Comcast cable at his current address where only he and his wife live, so he must be getting it under another person's name illegally. Thank you very much."
1,"As a Comcast customer for over 13 years, we received notice for ""Enhancing our network by ordering digital equipment"" more upgrades in the mail and captions running on the bottom of the TV screen that required action by March 16, 2010.On March 5, 2010 at 9:50am, I called Comcast as directed and spoke with customer service rep. Joe (no last name), who was unable to access my account from my home number or the information I received from Comcast in the mailer. Joe was very short with his answers and ready to disconnect the call before I could ask any questions about the digital device. Joe stated that I had to order the devices and schedule an install or I would only get channels 2 through 23 for $7.95.I was totally dissatisfied with this information not to mention very rude service, so I ask Joe for his supervisor or manager and he stated that ""they are busy and you will have to email, mail your complaint or hold for next available"". I ask for a contact number and he said, 820445 and disconnect the call, no surprise there.I called back and spoke with Mary, who was very informative and professional. She explained the entire enhancement offer. Now, it turns out that we do not need the digital device after all and we can keep our current service."
1,"I was denied cable service at my home. There is one person on my road who gets it, and two of us were denied.  We only live within eight tenths of a mile from each other."
1,"Have had no service for phones, internet or TV for over a week. Called and spoke with someone every day and they are ""working"" on it. I am alone with three kids, one with medical problems and I have no way of calling for help."
1,"I signed up under a promotion they were running for the new year. Free DVR for six months then $8.99 for the last six months, 2 free HD boxes, no service charge and $150 gift card. I told the operator when I signed up. She said that it was a great package and a lot of people are coming on board due to it. Well, it's all a lie. I have went back and forth with numerous CSA and multiple trips to corporate office, regarding my bill. The set price is supposed to be $138.92. I got as far as talking to a manager Frank and emailing him the offer. But nothing ever comes out of it. They just keep giving me runaround.I've given up on the $150 gift card, just to get the billing right but that's an impossible feat. It took me four trips to the Randolph rd office because the girl they have there kept telling me I'd have to pay for them when phone CS just told me different. This also happened with my internet service through them as well. That was only three trips though. Time and time again, I asked for a manager or supervisor. They always say they're out. They charged me for a DVR $30/mo. I never had another box for $8.99/mo, phone service $30/mo for months. That's alot of money.If I didn't have family issues with my one-year old, I'd been on top of it. It's just when the hospital bill come in, I start looking where all the money went to and why. I was able to get just some of the credit from all the overcharges. And now, I've come to the end of my one year service contract with them and I'm still fighting for some answers. I just filled a formal complaint after waiting 20 minutes on hold just to be hung up on because I couldn't produce my account number. But I could give her all the other information she wanted. I waited on hold for 35 minutes for a supervisor tonight trying to resolve this only to find out she's not a real supervisor. They are doing and charging what they want and not honoring their promotions. And when you try to find out why, they stone wall you. I have had many kind conversations with multiple CSRs but none that could aid in this struggle of lies and deceit. "
1,"Comcast had a promotion whereas if you signed up for cable services, you would get $150.00 in gas.  I signed up and then was sent a voucher to submit either by mail or online to GotGasPromo.com.  I was to enter the promo code given and choose a gas station vendor to purchase gas from and I had to save up $100.00 a month in gas receipts and send them in.  I was then supposed to receive $25.00 a month for 6 months as long as I sent in my receipts by the end of the last day of the month.  Well, I never received the monthly coupons that were supposed to be turned in with the receipts.  I called the number listed in the letter I received and once again requested the coupons, I have yet to receive them.  This is very suspicious and misleading by Comcast and GotGasPromo.  I have yet to receive any ""free"" gas. "
1,"I was paying $143.00 a month for Comcast’s triple play: cable TV, internet, and phone service.  I was told I was locked into this for two years starting 08-09.  They recently raised my bill, changing my service.  They told me that because I did not sign a contract and the 'package' I had was no longer offered, I could not keep it.  I talked to a supervisor and was told my new monthly bill will be restored.  They have now sent me a bill for $173.00 which included $21.00 for a partial month of my new service.  They have lied to me on two occasions about what I am getting and what it costs.  I was never told about a contract, nor was I ever sent one.  I cannot afford to keep paying more and more to Comcast when they tell me my bill will be the same for two years and then change it saying I never signed a contract."
1,"On or about, Thursday, January 14, 2010, we had the Triple Play Package installed at our residential property. From day one, we have been calling with complaints regarding the billing/listing that should have been under our business name, New Vision Housing, but for a residential property. It took Comcast three weeks to finally resolve and fix that issue. Meanwhile the services are constantly not working.To this day the internet has only worked two days and that has occurred over this past week (with the need of technicians coming out twice this week and hours on the phone with Customer Service over a four-day period). Only to find out that the original technician placed the wrong power pack on the modem, which caused the modem not to work properly and eventually the modem blew out on Sunday, February 21st, causing the telephone connected to the modem to blow its power pack out, as well as four electrical outlets, a GFCI in our kitchen area. Because the electrical is not working, the burners do not work on the stove top.We have had no properly working service since day 2 of the installation and the tech placed the wrong power pack on the modem causing it to blow, along with our kitchen electrical--and the Billing Department has offered to eliminate only $75 from a $300 bill because Customer Service has not always notated the Comcast computer narrative when I call in. A technician was scheduled to come out on February 9, 2010 and was a complete no -how. So frustrated with the entire system and their poor customer service, I did not have time to call in again until Saturday, February 20, 2010--when I spoke to seven different reps--two that would not identify their IDs because of the ongoing complaints that I had.One that did not identify himself to me is so ignorant that he didn't realize that he scheduled an appointment for a tech to come out on February 22nd and upon my complaint--Management can identify him. He also refused to transfer me to his Supervisor. He hung up on me. At this point, I am waiting for a Billing Supervisor to review our file in order to make the appropriate adjustments to the bill. Our goal is to have all the charges eliminated and obtain another service provider--because we continue to have problem with the service working properly.Definitely we should not be expected to pay for installation when the tech placed the wrong power pack on the modem and is now causing us to be without usage of our stove top. I am drafting a letter to the CEO in hopes that he will eliminate this outstanding bill before a scheduled dissconnection of services. Because Comcast Staff will review the file and the reps have not continually notated the records when we call in with each issue."
1,"I go through oil like water. I add a quart every 1000 miles. BMW tells me that that's normal on a 2005 X5. Also, the door on the passenger side does not open all the time. It just gets stuck for no reason at all. "
1,"My problems are big and should not be overlooked! My first issue occurred when a technician was scheduled to come out and do an installation on Feb 16, 2010 from 8-11 am. The guy shows up at 5 pm and said he could not do the installation due to how much snow was on the ground. So after that, my husband & I went outside and shoveled the snow from around the pole all the way to house. After that, there should have been no excuses! After that, 1 day later, my menu screen goes out, and my phone as well! I called back to place an order for the Stars package and I told the agent on the phone my issues. She walks me through how to reset the phone line (but that did not work) then she tries to send a signal to the box (and that does not work). So she re-schedules a Technician to come out again for Friday, the 26th, from 2-5pm. After 5 pm comes and goes, on the 27th I called at 5 pm & 7pm and 2 agents told me that someone was still coming, they're just running late! (No one ever came).I still have the installation check! I'm not happy. I have a home business, with no phone. I can't work! I also have kids that need cable in their playroom. This is insane! All I want to know is when is a technician coming to my house? (I don't want anymore subcontractors coming to my house, that can't do their job. I want a Comcast representative in a Comcast vehicle). I'm done with the ** from this company! I don't feel as though I should even have to pay a first month bill! This process has been a pain. My husband and I have been taking off work to wait for the contractors to show up (who never come on time or just don't come at all). I could have gone to work and made money or better yet called Verizon!"
1,"I had to leave California on an emergency. I immediately called Comcast cable to cancel my service. They informed me that it would take 10 days to come out and cut off the service. Also, I made arrangements with them to pick up the equipment and there would be no charge for that. When I called to verify that service was disconnected, they informed me that it was not! They also stated that the current residence asked them not to disconnect service and they obliged!I called today and they told me they had no record of me calling or any arrangements that I made. They barely put in a request to cancel the service today and then, they told me that they were not allowed to pick up the equipment. I asked to speak with the supervisor of the attending operator and Catherine id#606201 was very unprofessional and unhelpful. When I asked for her supervisor, she then stated that she had no supervisor and there was no one else I could speak with besides her! She refused to give me an address to write to or a phone number to call. She stated that I could only speak with her regarding the account and to top it all off she told me that ""it sounds like a personal problem and I should speak with the people that live in the residence."" Another month of charges were incurred as a result of this plus charges for the equipment."
1,"I lived in an apartment for 8 months while I was remodeling my house. I moved back to my house on Nov. 21, 2009. I had Comcast telephone, Internet and cable services in the apartment and asked Comcast to transfer the same services to my new place effective Nov. 21, 2009. I got my services in the new place with some minor problems (like calling features on my phone was not transferred) and paid regularly for my services. Last week I realized that my monthly bill was increased by more than $200. I called Comcast for clarification. After a long conversation, it appears that it's because I asked to transfer my services to a new location. It was not specifically clear that services should be disconnected at the old address first.  So after about 3 months (Nov 21, 2009 to date, Feb. 23), Comcast realized that they had to charge me for the services they missed to note as disconnected in my old address.A Comcast operator asked me to remain on line and wait for her to try to fix this. It was a long wait. I told them that this was their mistake and they should fix it and let me know rather than making me wait on line. The correction did not happen.  I called again a couple of times to talk to a manager but after about 45 minutes of waiting each time, no one picked up the phone and I hang up.The issue is not still resolved. It's like being robbed $200+. I lost lots of time to call, to follow up, and ultimately to find a place to post my dissatisfaction. I am posting this for public awareness and not legal action. "
1,"A Comcast representative charged me for additional TV installation which I did not want. I tried to explain that there was a charge after 3 months that I didn't understand, and they told me that I had asked for this service. However, based on my bill and initial set up, I only wanted to have my one TV set up for basic cable. They insisted that I wanted a second TV set up as well. This was not the case, and they are forcing me to pay an additional set up fee.This is not right, and nobody is helping me get the charge off my account. I kept being put on hold. I just want one TV working as previously set up and discussed. The people at Comcast say they can't help me and I have to pay another set-up fee. I have heard other horror stories, but I can't believe that Comcast gets away with stealing money from their customers like this."
1,"As usual the Comcast representatives are very ignorant by definition and implication. I discontinued all services in January 2010, dropped off all equipment in person to the Greensburg office and asked the rep. how much my final bill would be. She said my service was stopped and that they would be out to shut the line off in February, but I did not need to be there. She continued to explain that I would not owe anything, that actually I would have a credit. Unfortunately, I thought this would be the end of the matter, but for Comcast, bills always continue to come. Shortly after, I received a bill due Feb. 14 for $106.84, $5 of which was for a modem I had returned in December. Keeping in mind, I discontinued billing in mid Jan., I then received a second bill for $203.26 due now. I no longer live at the Fern Drive address. I was shot in Aug. 2009 and I am disabled. This is why I changed residence and firmly informed Comcast by phone and in person that I would no longer need service. Yet they continue to increase bill after bill. The people I live with are over 60 with numerous health conditions. They assist in the payments of my outstanding bills, and it was they who charged and paid my December bill and paid my online Comcast bills. When they saw both the $106 and the $203 bills, they nearly had a heart attack. They accused me of being wrong; that I had never stopped service or turned in Comcast equipment. I called Comcast immediately, first speaking to Jeremy. He couldn't solve anything, merely stating the numbers on the bill. I immediately asked for a supervisor. After a total of over 30 minutes from the time I called, I was switched to a supervisor named LaVida. She was also very incompetent, insisting I didn't turn in my equipment until January 31, 2010. As I stated over and over, I was in a hospital on January 31. I was admitted on January 22, 2010 to be exact. After a length argument, she saw that the equipment was indeed turned in prior to Jan. 31. She totalled my balance to $0. I am not satisfied at all. I do not like being called a liar. I don't like having numerous increasing bills sent out incorrectly, especially after I called in myself and I stopped in the local office in person. I also don't like that Comcast cannot or will not accept responsibility for any wrong action. This includes the incorrect billing, cable termination days, and the simplest being the drop off of Comcast equipment. Comcast incorrectly marked the drop off dates of my internet modem and my hi-def cable box. I feel by changing the termination dates and the equipment drop off dates, Comcast is attempting a form of fraud. I also feel that by charging customers a month ahead, and not making all necessary adjustments to those months it's also fraud because of the taxes and fees being assessed to the future months. I feel that because of everything I have had to endure, to simply terminate my cable, I should receive a month's credit, or an amount equal to which Comcast attempted to defraud me."
1,I have a Comcast cable box in my backyard full of bees! We have tried contacted Comcast by phone reporting this matter with no response. We want something done about this matter before a child is injured or killed.
1,"I have had ongoing billing issues from beginning from being charged for free installation to not getting promotional offers and having late fees/disconnects while disputing charges. I found speaking on phone to customer service reps was pointless as things were never documented. I began dealing with customer escalation team when someone tweeted displeasure with Comcast. I had everything in writing. I was dealing with Melissa ***, who initially got things straightened out around Thanksgiving. I refused to speak with anyone on the phone because of previous history. I wanted it all in writing. I was still having issues with internet connectivity, so I emailed her on 1/7/10 advising her that my internet was down yet again. I was fed up and would be seeking alternate Internet service. I stated clearly that I wanted service canceled and would continue with my basic cable.No response. I sent another email on 1/20 detailing previous string. I expected to be credited for down service from previous period that I had paid for and expected any/all late charges, etc., to be credited. She referred a local rep ""Saundra"" to contact me. I advised her in writing again that I would not interact in any way outside of email so there would be no confusion. I was advised that Saundra would credit me accordingly and send a letter in confirmation. I received a letter the beginning of February that was vague and didn't make sense. There was no contact info other than a phone number. I was not communicating except in writing. I figured I would receive a bill that would break things down more clearly.I received the bill yesterday and saw that they had continued to bill be for internet service, plus late fees, in excess of $150 for the past three periods. I immediately emailed Melissa *** yet again detailing things and including the string showing I had clearly requested internet service be canceled and credited retroactively. I received no response. This afternoon, I was entertaining a lunch with my boyfriend, my mother, and his parents. This was the first time they were meeting and a Comcast rep comes to the door to collect $150 for late fees or he's disconnecting it immediately. Of course, everyone heard this. I told him I could show him emails detailing ongoing issues. He said no money, he was disconnecting, that there would be late fees, penalties, and reconnect fees. I will be pulling my credit reports Monday as I am sure they have also impacted my credit with these ongoing issues. (I am happy to forward the email strings documenting all of this)."
1,"I moved and had to switch to Comcast for cable. They overcharged me by $100 for the install fees. They now refuse to even look at my account. I have sat on hold for so long that I told them to call me when it was corrected. It is not corrected and they say they can't call me. Not won't, but can't. So, three months later, I'm with a company that I don't want to use and they are blatantly overcharging me. So far I have lost $100 and endless hours of my life that I will never get back."
1,"January 2010 we requested a Comcast sales person meet us at our home in order to determine if Comcast could help us reduce our current internet and phone providers from 2 to 1.Holly H. came to the house. Our request was to have a second modem installed that would have the primary house phone number and to hard wire my husband’s computer in order to access the internet. Our current service was Comcast TV, Comcast Digital phone and internet in a back office with a separate phone number from the primary house number.Holly indicated that this could be done at the additional monthly fee of $25.00; $20.00 for the additional line and $5.00 for a modem rental. This would also include an upgrade to the Economy T.V. package. On January 20th a technician came out to the house and told Jim, my husband, that our request could not be done. I contacted Holly who then contacted her supervisor. Between the two of them, they determined that our request was reasonable and doable. Holly had to replace the order.On February 2 another technician came out. He arrived exactly at 4:00 and said that our request could not be done. I immediately called Holly who then placed a call to her supervisor. The technician gave Holly his direct line and while it was waiting to hear he left for another call and we never heard from him again. I placed another call to Holly at 6:12 p.m. on February 2, asking for an update and she had none. I called Holly on February 3 at 10:07 a.m. asking for an update. She had none. She said she would call me by the end of the day. I did not hear from her. I called again on February 4 at 1: 24 p.m. and since I had still not heard from her I cancelled the order.During Holly's initial visit she explained that we will need a digital box to continue getting our current channels after Comcast goes digital and that two would be given free during the installation of our order. Since the order was never completed we did not receive the digital converter box. When I originally had the internet and digital voice installed in the back office we had Limited Basic TV service. The technician who installed these services told us that they would not work with Limited Basic TV service so he did whatever he needed to do which also resulted in us receiving additional channels without our payment changing. Since the new order was not completed and I did not want to lose the additional channels, I called Comcast on 2/16/2009 requiring about the digital converter box. Since our records showed that we only had Limited Basic service, the digital converter box was not necessary. I immediately talked to sales and told them the story about the original install of the internet and made arrangements to upgrade to the Economy Package. I spoke with Tiffany. She was going to mail the converter box and the Economy Package would be become effective until I had received the box. It would be coming by UPS and we'd have to sign for it. She said nothing about our existing service changing.I also shared with her our earlier problem. I told her that we were confused about who we could trust. She said we could trust the sales department. She also offered to talk to a colleague who had a connection with dispatch and she'd get back with me the evening of 2/16 to let me know the results. Was it really possible to have a 2nd modem and another computer hardwired for the internet? She never called me back. On 2/18/10 our channels have been reduced to the Limited Basic Service. I called sales and was told that because our account was coded for this level of service and that they were correcting a problem where homes in our area were getting channels, they were not paying for as a result of installing the digital hardware we were included in that corrective action. I was also told at this time that the converter box will take 3-7 business days to receive.As you can see our experience with the sales versus technician staff at Comcast has been a problem ever since we requested installation of internet and digital voice services. Sales says one thing, the technician another, Sales does not return phone calls; technicians leave a job yet because they were here before 4:00 p.m. The customer doesn't get the $100 for late shows, yet nothing is accomplished. Yet Comcast wants to be the preferred provider of cable, digital voice and internet services. "
1,"A roommate moved out, had not paid his cable bill. Debra (technician) arrives to disconnect his service (according to Eric, a night supervisor, in a phone conversation at 7:30 pm on 02-17-2010) and to not remove equipment other than Wayne's DVR which is Comcast's property. Instead, she stole my cable modem, my personal property for which I paid $70 and had loaned to Wayne to use. In effect Debra (Comcast employee) stole personal property. I was told by Eric that she would return my equipment today by 10 am. It is now 10:55 am, she has made no appearance whatsoever. I made a call to Comcast again at 10:15 am, spoke with Nadia that Debra has not appeared at the promised time to return equipment she stole. Debra finally arrived at 11 am, picked up the correct equipment and returned my modem, though I don't know if she has damaged it. Now, I will have to get it and test to make sure it is in good working condition. If not, Comcast owes me one Motorola modem."
1,"History of Frustrations with Comcast Service: After progressively poor service starting back in Oct- November 2009 time frame, we have tried several attempts to get a Comcast service man to fix the problem. They stated they could only visit during working hours. The problem has become worse over time such that now we have been plagued by losing channels, receiving messages stating that the channel will be available in a moment but never does, poor digital reception, no digital reception, and finally the digital boxes not working at all. We have only about 5-6 channels as the Digital Box does not work at all. After having cancellations and rescheduling a number of times, I agreed to take a half day vacation to wait at home for the service man. The service man was to be there between 2:00 and 5:00 on 2/23/10. These are the sequence of events while waiting for my 2:00-5:00PM service call at 2:00 PM. To make sure that I did not miss the service man, I sat in the room near the front door doing work so that I could watch the drive way and street for the service man. Throughout the afternoon, I watched out the window as my neighbors drove by, but no Comcast trucks ever passed. I could hear any car coming down the street so I missed nothing.At 4:25 PM: I called Comcast service and spoke to a gentleman that stated that the service man came by at 3:30 and no one was home and that they left a note on the door. I explained that this was impossible as I was at the front window all afternoon and no one came to the door. I walked out to check the door and there was no note. I explained that I was told that I would receive a call 30 minutes prior to the visit and it was nearing the 30 minutes before the end of the 2:00-5:00 service window and that I absolutely wanted someone to come today since I took a whole afternoon of vacation to wait for the service man. The gentleman said he would contact the dispatcher and they would contact me within 15 minutes.At 5:00 PM: Still no call back. So I called again. This time I spoke with ""Ivan"". I explained all of the above. He said he was sorry but there was no ""ticket number in the system"". I explained yet again that I wanted someone to come tonight, further explaining that if I took all afternoon as vacation I expected they could pay a service man a little over time to correct the situation. Ivan provided me a service ticket #190818 and said someone would call me within 5-10 minutes. I asked for his phone number to call him back as I explained this is what I was told last time and no one called me back or even recorded the problem at all. He said he did not have a direct number to provide me and that if I did not receive a call back by 5:30 to definitely call back and that the service request is still open and had not been closed so they could still get handled my call. I explained at this point that I if they cancelled my service call for today then I would have to cancel my service with Comcast as for the very poor cable service and much more so -- the repair service. I also explained that I had recorded carefully all of the events and I felt I should make this sequence of events well known if I did not get better service. I asked if she wanted to reconsider.She responded by saying she would send me over to a special department that will handle my problem and provide me with a discount for my hardships. She then transferred me to a recorded messaging system that asked for my phone number for security reasons. I punched in my number and at that point was then disconnected. Why would anyone stay with Comcast after going through this? "
1,"I have Comcast for TV, internet and phone. I had full outage of all services for 5 hours on Friday and 3 hours on Sunday with spotty problems later. Comcast scheduled a tech for Monday 11-1. They did not show. When I called, they rescheduled to 5-7. At 7, I called and they said they decided to reschedule to the next day without even notifying me. That service is the worst I ever received from any business in my life. I will find a way to drop them even if I have to go through additional effort, I will not give them my money!"
1,"For 6 months, I have had poor phone service. I average 5-6 dropped calls per day. I have called them 31 times over 6 months. It still drops calls every day, sometimes while I am calling Comcast to complain. They have fraudulently billed me 6 months for a service they have not provided. I constantly use my cell phone as I cannot rely on the service I pay Comcast for."
1,"I agreed to buy Comcast Triple Play from an ""authorized"" Comcast retailer on the internet. First, the triple play was supposed to come with a $200 Amazon gift card. It changed to $250 in ""Saveology"" dollars which actually means nothing. It is a scam, plain and simple. Then, after many calls and holding many times, I get to Comcast in Dover, DE for actually finalizing the deal and they want my social security number and aren't familiar with the deal I supposedly have and there are extra charges for every little thing. Then, they can't make an appointment of installation when we will be there in a few days. They even made an appointment and then canceled it just before I canceled the order. "
1,"I have been subjected to inconsistent billing and communication about my charges for the past six months. I have been forced to call into Comcast customer service multiple times to rectify the errors, which somehow appear again. Each time, I am promised a new package, and a worry-free future, but it only lasts a month until I see my next bill.Sample this: I have been put in four different packages upon recommendation of your customer service reps, each time I have not been told about terms of the contract or package exclusions. I was even awarded a $50 credit for miscommunication by one of your reps, which never showed up, and I find out it did not because I was not entitled to it.Is this how you treat your valuable customers? Five years and I am not counting anymore. I am switching out of a majority of your services because I have tried in good faith for the past six months to be a loyal customer. It doesn't work like that with Comcast. So here I am, I complain for one last time. I expect no response, but I do hope you fix the number of bundles and conditions you place on customers with unclear transition points between each and varying contractual obligations. It is a maze that nobody can possibly solve.Some of your reps are polite, but the last one I spoke to was rude, cocky and even careless about my account history. Adieu Comcast, mostly, because you still have a monopoly on TV in my area. "
1,"After a year of terrible customer service and being unemployed for a couple months, I decided to cancel my cable and internet with Comcast. I took a few hours and took all my hardware, ie. cable box and internet modem plus all the wires and remote to their office in Sugar House SLC, UT. On January 29, Friday, I wanted to have it canceled that day as I was also moving that day. I was told all services would be canceled that day. I asked specifically if I would have anything taken out of my account as I did have a balance of $7.89 and the customer service representative said no, once they cancel a subscription then they can't take the money out of an account. She told me that I had to mail in a check for the remaining balance with my account info on it.The very next Friday, February 5, $51.37 was drawn out of my account, which put my account in the negative. As I said before, I am unemployed and did not have this balance. I didn't see this until Saturday February 6th, I called immediately to have them give me my money back. The 1st lady I spoke with was very rude and unhelpful, I continued until I finally got a supervisor, which until this call I was never able to do. After talking with and arguing that Comcast made the mistake and owed me the money back she said it would normally take 4-6 weeks and that I needed to see if my bank would make some exceptions when I got some fees for bounced checks from that weekend. I called my bank and they said they would try to work with me as best of possible, however I didn't want my account to be negative, so I borrowed some money to deposit in my account. The Comcast Supervisor, Salima said she would try to get the refund expedited on Monday and would call me back on Tuesday.I called on Tuesday and she was not in the office so I left her message. I called again on Wednesday, February 10 and still only got a voice mail. I finally received a call from her and she told me that they couldn't refund my money and I had to go through my bank to get the money back. It had something to do with EFT and ACH or some financing terms. I called my bank again and spoke with the branch manager and he said that since it came right from my checking account, the bank couldn't get the money back from Comcast. Around and around it goes, I called the Comcast Supervisor back and again got voice mail, left a message and told her what my bank said and said that she needed to get my money back. "
1,"On February 9, 2010 about 2:30 pm, technician for Comcast came to my home to install new internet service but he changed some of my software and added new software I did not need or want without my knowledge, plus the software he added, my computer is not performing as it was."
1,"Jackie, a Comcast service representative, refused to credit me for service not received.  This morning, 2/9/10, from 5:00am-6:30am PST, Comcast TV provided no service to my four TVs.  I watched the boxes reboot themselves (via home office signal) and then, I had service.  I need credit for cable service not received.  Jackie refused saying that I had failed to call at 6:00am when the problem was in progress even though their office was not open.  She also refused to credit for a partial day.  She also refused to allow me to speak to a supervisor.  Very, very poor service on the part of Comcast."
1,"When I moved to Florida, I needed High Speed Internet, and contacted Comcast. I talked with a sales representative who sold me on high speed internet only, for $33 a month for 12 months with free installation. When the technician came, they gave me an official Comcast pink install receipt which showed under special instructions the following: ""HSD only $33.00 12/month free install."" Since I've had problems with Comcast before, I kept the pink slip. My first bill came correctly, charging me $33. My next bill charged me $59.95. I called in and was told that a ""Billing Specialist"" had reviewed my order and found that there was no code that allowed me a $33 special. So, without contacting me, the ""billing specialist"" had changed my bill to $59.95 a month. I wasn't allowed to talk to the ""billing specialist. "" I was only allowed to talk to the customer care rep, or could talk to a supervisor who couldn't do anything. I was told I had to request an ""audit"" of my account. Of course, the customer care rep had no copy of my original install receipt, and couldn't obtain one. I was told that I would get no call from a billing specialist, and to call back in a week to see if there had been any change to my account.A little over a week later, my internet service was shut off. I had to waste over an hour driving to a Comcast office with my paperwork. I showed the Comcast rep my install receipt and she agreed that it said I should be paying only $33 a month for 12 months, but couldn't find the ""code"" to allow me to do this. I had to wait while she called the sales rep. After she was done, she told me the sales rep would call me to straighten things out. She made a photocopy of my install paperwork and requested a second audit. The Comcast rep admitted to me that this happens all the time. Sales reps quote an introductory price, and then change the up the price without notifying the customer and make it almost impossible to get your introductory offer honored. If I couldn't find my installation pink slip, I wouldn't even have any proof of the introductory offer. I call this a scsm! "
1,"Me and my wife have been trying to resolve a billing issue for months. We moved in October 2009 and cancelled service and paid our final bill before we had service connected at our present address. We have been getting billed for all of October through December. They claimed we did not disconnect service. We went into the local office with paperwork proving it was disconnected in October. We were told it would be taken care of and they apologized to us. Now they are saying they have no record and are demanding payment. We have proof that the tech signed when he took the box from the old address and have provided them with a copy at the office. I don't know what else to do except get an attorney. They are billing us for three months we did not live there, despite the fact that we showed a copy of Comcast paperwork stating it was disconnected in October."
1,"My parents are elderly individuals, and I signed them up for basic cable with Comcast so that they can have the news and the weather forecasts. There has never been a late payment in over 2 years of service and on Thursday, January 14th, their service went out. I called Comcast myself and the representative stated that there was an outage in the area and they were working on it and cable service would be back in a few hours. On Friday afternoon, approx. 4:30 pm my father contacted Comcast again as there was still no cable. He was told by one claiming his name to be Mr. G, that he needed a box in order to receive service again. My father told Mr. G he did need a box, all he needs is his basic service back. He explained to Mr. G that he is elderly and only need the TV for weather forecasts and the news, so he did not need more channels and he sure did not need to pay more.Mr. G told them that there is no charge for the box, which turned out to be true, however, when my father asked about the monthly charges, Mr. G told him that there would not be an increase to that either, (this turned out to be a lie), so he signed them up to receive the box. On Saturday, January 16th, I called in and got a female who stated her name was Brenda (I think, can't really remember for sure). I explained the situation to her and she told me there would be no increase on the monthly charge, and they did indeed need to have a box in order to get back the cable service. I somehow did not believe they needed to have a box to have basic cable service and I have never heard of charges not being increased on upgrades. They did not state that it would be an upgrade, but I felt that's what was happening. On Sunday, January 17th approx. 3:30 pm the cable van was there and the cable service was restored, I felt something was fishy about the entire scenario, so on Monday, January 19th I got my father to my computer and we did a ""live chat"" with Comcast. The ""Service Analyst"" (as he stated) who handled us on the live chat listed his name as Jason. I have the printout of the conversation between Jason and my father and in that print out (yes, I have it in black and white) Jason also reassured my father that there would be no increase monthly charge. Well guess what, Jason also lied. The new statement arrived and the monthly charge has increased.So, I called in today (Feb 8th approx 2:34 pm) and spoke with a rep who identified himself as Marvin. Marvin stated that the account was upgraded and the increased charges are for the upgrade. He said, he could not explain why we were told what we were told by others, but he would send out a technician to retrieve the box tomorrow as we do not need a box in order to have basic cable. That is fine with us, however, we do not appreciate being lied to by so many representatives of Comcast. It is absolutely ridiculous. I will tell every person I know that if they have a choice for cable or any service offered by Comcast, they must not choose Comcast. I will discontinue my own personal service and will be moving to DiecTV. I now view Comcast Representatives as liars and therefore will no longer do any business with that company. "
1,My service price continues to change. It has run as high as $334 per month and as low as $100 per month. I ordered the triple play with free HBO in August of 2009 and have had to make 4 phone calls to have my bills corrected. Again I am being over charged! Can you please review this account? Today Clarisa at the Union office (she would not give me additional information) was unsure of why this has changed. She also could not make an adjustment to my account. There was no supervisor available and she assured me she would look into this matter. At least 3 hours on the phone.
1,"I am having trouble with my signal, all spotty now for over 24 hours. This happens all the time and I am getting sick of it. It always happens when I am counting on watching a program. I would like to have my bill compensated accordingly or I will go to another carrier and my family and friends feel the same way! I have had enough of this poor quality with my service."
1,"They have sporadic HD service, with some channels out for weeks. It took 2 visits and 8 hours for repairman to say ""outside"" issue in the network. Customer service on phone can't keep up with problem. Then internet goes down. Who pays for my time and frustration? Who allows monopolies like this to continue? Didn't we break up the ** phone companies for this reason?"
1,"Comcast promised me service at a rate of $44.95 for one year of cable. Every month, they send me my bill with a price of $74.90 plus taxes, for my cable alone. I also have internet and home phone service through them. I call them every month and argue, telling them I did not want my cable at a rate of $74.90. They tried and blamed it on my failure to sign a contract, however, I have signed a contract with them on multiple occasions. Last month, I tried calling Comcast to have my services put into their $99 promotional bundle, and their representative informed me, ""you can not get the bundle without paying penalty fees for early cancellation of your contract"". Now, here we are, one month later, and my bill is way higher than it is supposed to be, with cable being billed at $74.90. Their reasoning for this is that ""you failed to sign and submit the contract"".  Sorry, but I feel like they are attempting to scam funds out of me every which way possible. They are dishonest in honoring their service obligations. The contract only seems to be in existence when it is to their benefit.  I can barely pay these bills coming in at such a high rate. My husband is unemployed, and I go to school full-time. Internet is crucial for my success in school, therefore, I must pay my Comcast bill every month. However, I need to spend hours upon hours every month, arguing with these people who call me a liar."
1,"I have been waiting on a refund since I moved out of Tower 2000, Apartment ** on August 2009 because of a military reassignment. I have called a number of times for the refund of over $200. A customer ticket number was assigned, which is **. The problem I have is if I owed money, I would have been turned over to a collection agency. In this case CASCOM is earning interest on my money which is a problem. I request an inquiry of why it takes CASCOM so long to refund customers."
1,"I have Comcast for my cable service alone with internet and phone service. I recently called them to downgrade my service. I was informed that my Social Security Number is not the one on my account. Due to a computer data mix up, the Social Security was mixed. They have no idea where my SSN or any other customer number is."
1,"I installed internet and paid. Since Thursday service was off, due to Comcast not have set the modem in their system. I lost my work since I was an accountant. This is the busiest time of year. After I called 25 people that were so rude, they will disconnect you while you are getting instructions on how to fix it. Then, I asked and they said they will send a technician. The technician did not show up on Saturday. Lost business again, no one called, no one showed up. You called, they hung up on you. How can these people be in this kind of business? Why not conduct a quality assurance simulation? Comcast does not treat customers right!"
1,"I was told that I can pay a certain amount today to continue service, and now, they won't honor that i'm trying to pay $200 and $200 on February 12, 2010."
1,"I was a Comcast customer and fell a couple of payments behind. I didn't get a final notice, and they cut off my cable on January 22, 2010. I paid in full on January 27, 2010. After that, I received the final notice and noticed they didn't send it out until January 25, 2010. And it stated that the total was due by February 16, 2010 or my cable would be turned off. I find this to be bad business practices and am never doing business with their company again. "
1,"I canceled bundled service (TV, Internet and phone) with Comcast after only a month of service. I canceled via phone at the end of September and was told that my account was closed, but a technician had to physically visit our house to disconnect the service. This could be done from outside the home. I have continued to be billed by Comcast every month since September. I called their Customer Service every month and go through the same song and dance. The representative confirms that they can see in their system that I canceled my service in September, but that someone needed to physically disconnect service. I'm told that a technician is scheduled to visit during the week after I make my call. Then I receive another bill from them. My total bill is nearly $600.00 and the bill states that my account is severely past due and that a collections agency will be getting involved!  I am so disgusted with this company that I can feel my heart race. I feel helpless as I do not know what other route to take other than continue to contact them and explain the situation to another inept customer representative who continue to make the same empty claims while my credit is on the line. At this point my bill from them continues to rise and they are threatening the involvement of a collections agency that will affect my credit score."
1,"I decided to sign up for the Comcast Triple Play in July of last year. The deal was all three services, phone, cable and internet for $99 per month based on a two-year agreement. The understanding I had was that after 90 days of service, with an account in good standing, Comcast would mail me a check for $200 cash back. We are now going into February and still no refund check. I've gone back and forth with the customer service department and have received different answers every time I call. It is to the point now where I am planning to go back to satellite television when my contract expires in 18 months with Comcast. All I want is the cash back that they promised in writing. The deal is also on the bottom of their home page."
1,"I found my bill went up in Oct. 09, so I called. I was told very rudely that my ""specials"" were over. When I said it was wrong that ""new"" customers were given better deals, and their regular customers nothing, I was told very sarcastically that I was already paying less than many and there was nothing that could be done. In Dec. I was looking at my upcoming bill and saw it was being raised again. From Sept. to Jan. my bill went up $50 between the 2 increases. I also asked why I had a charge on the bill for ""blast"" speed, when that was not asked for, but was told by Comcast it was being given to their customers. Again, another entrapment, they ""give"" it to you for a period of time, then start charging.The store to return equipment is not conveniently located, and the wait is 45 minutes or more. Also, they owe me money and claim it is going to take 8 to 12 weeks. When I asked why so long, I got a cock and bull story about how the program is out of the area; it is only run once or twice a month, then has to be put into an envelope and mailed. Please, do they think we are stupid? Yes they do. With a bill of $170 a month, I got rid of Comcast, but feel their business practices are illegal. I spent a lot of time trying to reach them on the phone, and had to deal with rude people."
1,"This company has a monopoly on Montgomery county cable TV. They deliver poor customer service, and are not knowledgeable about their own products and services. I had 3 separate techs. come to my residence to install wireless internet and after paying for 2 months and not having internet access, I canceled. Now I go to check my credit report and there are old Comcast accounts that were never forwarded when I moved to a new residence (5 years) ago and when I call to resolve the issue, they refuse to pull the collections when I am willing to pay in full. Their response was ""Sorry, the collections department just got a new staff and the accounts should have been forwarded but we were understaffed."" Worst of all, my credit score has taken a hit! "
1,"Do not send me an email. I will not check emails anymore because of the junk mail. Please just send someone out to reconnect my service ASAP. For several days, we have had no service at all. Please send someone right out to take care of this problem. I do not owe you any money (I have an $85 credit) so please put my TV antenna back together ASAP. Thank you. PS: It is now 7:19 on Wednesday, 1/27/10. We have been very patient but I think this has been overlooked. Please restore our Comcast cable antenna. Who or what is the perpetrator? Why doesn't this work either? I have made several attempts to send the email and it keeps asking for the perpetrator? Is that some kind of joke? Thank you so much (will we be billed for the 3 days we haven't had any service at all?)."
1,"I logged into my account and went to check  my personal bill. The address and name of another person appeared. I called Comcast and was given a reference number. I was told they're going to get back to me within 3 days, they never did. Now I went to log into my email and I can not. They say that the user name belongs to someone else. I have been with Comcast for 10 plus years, they now show I became a customer in May of 2008. "
1,"Early in December 2009 , I received a Comcast bill dated 11/21/09 stating ""Effective 10/29/09 you removed internet service at $42.95 a month. You added internet service at $59.95 a month "" This is absolutely untrue . At no point would I ever add internet service at $59.95 a month. Comcast decided this without my knowledge and permission.I called them and said I was discontinuing service as I could not afford it. The agent offered to put me on a program that would reduce my monthly cost to a little over $30 a month. I agreed. I asked the agent if the present bill of $66.80 would be deducted from my checking account. He assured me that it would not, that he already put in the change and the lower figure of $30 would be the December deduction. To my surprise and horror, Comcast deducted $66.80 from my account on Dec10th.I called to see how this could happen and I was told that the $30 amount quoted to me was an ""error"" that was found during an ""audit"". I asked why I was not informed of this and he really did not have any answer , only saying that I should have been told .That were 3 matters of deceit that they told me, one, that my monthly charge would be $30, two, that the $66.80 would not be deducted from my checking account and thirdly, failing to inform me of the so called ""audit"" which changed my billing charge.I returned the cable internet unit to Comcast the next day, December 22. I asked when I would get my refund and was told 6 to 8 weeks! I called again the second week in January and was again told 6 to 8 weeks. Comcast claims I have a refund due of $41.20 but I am up to their mercy on this as I cannot decipher the jargon they use on their statement. When I asked the local office agent to explain it to me, she acted annoyed and just repeated what it said on the bill. That was very rude.Everyone knows that Comcast charges you before the services are received. They should return to me the entire $66.80 that they defrauded me as I objected to that charge prior to the billing period. They told me that they would not charge me that amount and then took it out of my account anyway. And I don't want to wait 6 to 8 weeks for my refund. What company waits 6 to 8 weeks before issuing a refund? No one but Comcast.The difference between $30 and $66.80 may not seem significant to Comcast, but it is disastrous to me, a 75 year old woman on social security and a small pension, as I struggle to get by and provide for Christmas presents for my grandchildren. I explained this to the agent but she said there wasn't anything she could do. I would have to wait 6 to 8 weeks for Comcast to send me a check.In order to give presents to my grandchildren, I was a little short on my home taxes and as I wait to receive my refund check from Comcast, my taxes incur a small penalty. I can only think of Comcast as a thieving, unfeeling company that gets every cent they can through deceit  They can keep an elderly senior citizen's money a ridiculous amount of time without conscience. Please help me. What can I do?"
1,"On December 7, 2009, our family was involved in a 5 alarm fire at the address provided. I called Comcast to have my service disconnected until we found a place to live in. I was told at that time my bill would be $70. I received a bill from them yesterday claiming I owe Comcast $530.00. I called the company and they removed a charge of $70.00 for internet service ""that we never had to begin"". They then told me that I was responsible for $390.00 for the equipment which includes cable boxes and remote controls.I would like to know if that is possible because the answer I got from Comcast was that it's not their problem we were involved in a fire (we lost everything) and we are still required to pay the amount they stipulated for the equipment. I then told them I would mail them a copy of the fire report and they told me that it wouldn't change anything. Can you please help me? Thank You."
1,"The Comcast technician came out to my home on 1/19/10 to bury the cable that was exposed.  While doing so, they cut my phone line.  I advised the technician that they cut the line before they left and told me I had to call Comcast.  They set an appointment to the technicians to return today, 1/20/10, between 11am and 2pm.  No one showed up, no one called and when I contacted them again today, I got the run around including that I had to contact the local Comcast office at 404-266-2278 at 3620 Campcreek Pkwy Atlanta, GA.  It took four people to tell me that and when I did, they just said that people will come out until 8pm.  It gets dark at 6pm--more running around."
1,"I wonder why there is no closed captioning on any news and mini movies in any channels. I am very disappointed and won't watch these if there is no closed captionings because I am totally deaf and won't understand the lip speech at all. Please correct or contact Comcast Cable, I guess in PA. or Indiana."
1,"Comcast required 7 visits to my apartment, in the course of 4 days, to install my service. This was despite the multiple phone calls I placed to the customer service line, to be sure they would send the right service staff with the correct equipment. Time and time again, I was assured the correct people and installation would occur, and time and time again, they failed to so so. After the first failure to install, I was promised no charge for the installation. Nonetheless, the charge has been on my first three bills.Comcast also set up an online account for me, without telling me. This made me unable to log on to pay my bill. After 1 1/2 hours on the phone with customer service, we discovered that aside from creating an account I could not access, they had misspelled my name, and all accounts they had set up for me were thus, inaccessible. Aside from waiving an $11 installation fee, Comcast refuses to compensate me in any way for their repeated and continued customer service, including any upgraded service, which would obviously be of no cost to them.  Comcast does not care at all about their customers. I want to reach out to everyone I can, to caution them away from doing business with Comcast."
1,"My promotion with Comcast service is valid until 6/15/2010 for Basic Cable with DTA support and internet service. However, Comcast has disabled my cable service as on 1/15/2010. The CSR I called wants me to upgrade to the expanded cable service tier, which means discontinuation of the promotion in effect and increasing my monthly bill by 150%. This is an unfair trade practice. I cannot afford that."
1,"I have had Comcast for several years. I moved into a house that had 3 separate apartments, but all shared the same address. We all had individual cable and internet. I had service there for 2 months and received a bill for $550.00. There is a miscellaneous charge for almost $300.00. I went up to the office and immediately tried to get someone to explain what the charge was. No one could give me an answer; it just says miscellaneous charge.I talked to supervisors, managers, and customer support. No one could tell me what it was or would take it off my bill. I know it was for the other apartments' bills. But no one would help me. I tried to explain the set up of the house.When someone would move out, they would disconnect mine. They did not know what they were doing and who they were connecting. This is really unfair that I get stuck with an over $500.00 bill; I refuse to pay it. No one will call me back or even care to tell me what the miscellaneous charges which I know are for the other apartments. Someone please help. This is constantly ripping people off their needs. They need to be stopped doing this to people. It ruins our credit when it's their mistakes. My mother had problems too. She didn't even have cable or cable box, just internet service. And they were charging her bill pay-per-view movies every month. And living in FL, there's a lot of houses that have 1 house with separate apartments and same address. They need to figure this out or charge for 1 line per house. They also charged her disconnect and reconnect fees for the other apartments. Luckily, I caught it only after 4 months or she would have kept paying for it. 2 family members, 2 problems with Comcast. Come on. Please someone contact me about this. I will not stop till it's resolved."
1,"I’ve been without phone service for about a week now. I went through all the steps for activation. I have also talked to a manager about the situation. A tech was ordered Monday and Wednesday. No one came the first time; the second my order was cancelled minutes before the time when were to be at my home. I pay a lot for the tripe play and I have to go without service for a week. This is crazy. I have a business and most of my clients call, plus I have kids. If anything were to happen, they have no phone to call 911. A phone is really a big thing for me and I need it to work. One of my children is a special needs child; we need doctor appointments on a regular and constant commutation with their school. "
1,"I make frequent calls to Ecuador because I have a loved one over there. So in early November, I got a $14.95 international calling plan that I was told would cover 300 anytime minutes internationally. I was never told that it was only for land-line phones. Had I known that, I would have never gotten the phone plan because I only call one number in Ecuador and it is a cell phone number. So, of course as a result, I start making more calls to Ecuador and now I have a huge bill.Another thing that has happened is that when I call Ecuador, the call often doesn't go through. This happens all the time. I'll get strange ring tones or no ring tones, etc. and when that happens, I know the call isn't actually getting through. I've recently looked at a detailed description of the calls I've made to Ecuador and found out that each time I simply dial the number and the call doesn't go through, I am still charged for this.I paid $14.95 a month for an international plan which did me no good as well as incurred $99 of international calls for the month of November since that plan didn't actually cover me and I thought it did. I didn't get the bill for November until mid to late December and so was continuing to make a large number of calls to Ecuador during that time. So when I get my December bill, it will be even higher for international calls. The number of minutes I am being charged for Ecuador is also way too high considering that so many of the minutes were actually me simply trying to get through and not getting through (to no answering machine or anything, simply a bad, ineffective ring)."
1,"I paid online for my bill in November 2009 for $163.00.  And for some reason, there was an error on their end and my bank account was never charged.  Comcast charged me NSF and late fees so I called them stating that it was not my fault.  They agreed to reverse the fees provided that I pay $163.00 and I authorized it.  They instead charged my bank account $311.00 causing an overdraft and a fee of $25.00.  It charged my bank account $25.00 that I do not have, plus the headache and stress that their incompetence has caused."
1,"I visited the Comcast Stores in Marietta to purchase a new service for my home in Marietta on December 23, 2009. After paying for the service and receiving my equipment, the Comcast representative told me me that they would send out a technician to connect my service the next day for an outside connection. The technician came the next day and connected the service but my service did not work. I reported this to the Comcast Call Center and they told me they would send out a technician on the 26th to come and see what the problem was. The technician arrived and he told me that I needed to place another call to the call center as I required a new installation.I reported this to the call center and the following day, on the 27th, a new technician also came out and who also advised me that he only corrects problems and I should again contact the call center. I again called the call center and stressed that I needed a new installation, and, finally, a technician came out on the 31st of December, 2009 and laid a new cable from my house to the pole outside. He told me someone would come around to complete the installation. After calling the call center number everyday thereafter, they assured me that a technician would be out to complete the task the following day. It is now the 05th of January, 2010 and I am still waiting. I called the call center to cancel the service and refund the funds I paid for when I initially took the equipment from the Marietta office. I am not sure if this is an isolated case, but Comcast service is unsatisfactory and plainly non-existent. I will seek alternate services for my house in Marietta."
1,"Well, 5 months ago we were informed by AT&T that there is only one line coming into our house but we have been charged by Comcast for 2. We have a large house and I was told by a tech from Comcast 5 years ago that we had to have separate bills or we would be regarded as stealing cable. There is only one electric line coming into house and one water source. Only one pole outside with lines coming in on one side of the house. Now, we have been trying to get this resolved and by my calculations, they owe me almost $10,000. They are refusing to help me and I have since gotten a hold of the DPUC and found that they do not regulate them but they tried to help. Comcast continues to say that they are investigating, but in the meantime, they have sent my bill to collections while they are investigating and will not return any of our calls. We have asked the boxes to be turned on again but they will not turn them on and they won't give us a reason. I am stumped as to what to do. They did send out 2 men on 12/22/09 to see that there is only one set of lines coming into the house and we were also told by several Comcast customer service people that it is against the law to double bill a customer, but we were unaware of this at the time."
1,"I am a horror fan, a movie buff.  Why do I find the horror movie reviews on demand to be some kind of joke?  I am looking to view movies. I want to know content and rating, not your stupid jokes about the movies.  If you cannot do this job, I volunteer.  For goodness sake, give me a real review, not some stupid comments.  I do not like your movie review comments at all (horror genre), and do not appreciate jokes when looking at horror films.  I want honest reviews, not jokes.  I am so upset with this, it is not funny at all.  Give me honest reviews!   This is just stupid.   If you cannot find someone to do the job correctly, I will do it! "
1,"I would like this email to serve as a complaint against the rudest customer service agent I have ever spoken to in my entire life, who just stated to me after days worth of problems with my service that without reading any of the notes in my account regarding the problems and why my services were transferred, restored, canceled, etc., that she was canceling my tech appointment. She said that the previous agent made an ""error in reconnecting your service"" that the previous agent worked in a different department, and implied that they didn't know what they were doing and that a manager would have to call me back on my cell phone because she was canceling my home phone as we spoke. That was 10 minutes ago and I have still not heard from a Comcast manager. It's a disgrace, Shawn was the customer service (not) agent!"
1,"The problem with all providers of cable, satellite and fiber optic services is that it makes no difference what pricing you negotiate because they will never give you the agreed upon price in writing. It comes down to your word against theirs and guess who wins the first round? Until state Consumer Affairs departments sue to force these providers to confirm in writing the agreed upon pricing and terms the consumer will spend many hours on the phone trying to get providers to honor their commitments."
1,"First, I would like to apologize to your customer service representatives that I spoke with on December 17, 2009. The manner in which I spoke was rude and disrespectful and I formally apologize for that. I have never spoken with a representative from a company in that manner and regret that I did. However, I feel a lack of customer service and customer appreciation led me to act in such a manner. Four months ago, I moved out of my apartment at ** Denver, Colorado 80204. At that time, I called and attempted to terminate the service and was told I had to bring in the modem and cable box in order to terminate service. That was on September 8, 2009 at 1:46 pm MST. I then made several calls and spoke with different representatives. I was told that if I brought the equipment in and brought in my lease showing that I had moved that they would work with me on the bill. I made two calls on November 8th and one on December 3rd. None of this was noted in my account history. Consequently, after numerous calls to your customer care service representatives and one visit to the equipment return center in Denver, Colorado with my lease, I was told that I would be forced to pay the bill even though I was not using your company's service for those four months while I was not at that address. I moved out of the apartment on September 1, 2009 and did not use your company's services after that. The new residence I moved into on September 1, 2009 already had Comcast service when I moved in (under another customer's name) and therefore, I did not transfer service to my new address. I was told by Comcast customer service that you could not have two active accounts at the same address. My brother, Ryan **, moved into the apartment and set up a new and separate account at the old address. Your customer service representative acknowledged that there was a new account at the address and that my account was not being used but she would not terminate my bill and the amount owed, even though I have not had Comcast services at my old address or my new address for the last four months. Essentially, I am being charged for services that Comcast has not provided and this makes no sense to me. No one at customer service has tried to explain why Comcast is allowed to continue billing someone when Comcast is not providing services. I found that the way this situation was handled went against Comcast's customer service mission statement listed on your company's website.I would like to have the amount owed to your company on my account terminated because of this. The representatives I spoke with acknowledged that I was not in the apartment and was not using the services but said there was nothing they could do. This shocked me being in the customer service industry myself. Additionally, the customer service representative that I dropped off my equipment with refused to look at my lease or look to see that my brother had a new account at my previous address and simply stated there was nothing they could do. Your company's inability to work or resolve the issue disturbed me to the point of extreme frustration. I have never worked with a company that has not been willing to come to a solution that both sides find fair. This will be a determining factor in my decision to use your services again if my account is not cleared. Could you please reevaluate the circumstances I am under and clear the balance from my account? There is overwhelming proof that I was not at the address or receiving Comcast services for the four months I was billed. I have a new lease I signed and there was a new account established by another customer shortly after I moved out of the residence. I have been a loyal Comcast customer for seven years and was appalled by the manner in which no one would help me or work with me. If this issue is not resolved in a timely manner, I am unlikely to use your products or services again. Also, I will not pay the amount owed until this is settled in a fair and honest manner. In addition to this, I respect that my account will not be sent to collections and not incur any additional interest penalties or late fees. I appreciate your time and consideration. I realize that you are a busy person being a senior vice president of a large company but I would appreciate a timely response. Thank you for your time."
1,"For no apparent reason, my cable service is not receiving any connection from Comcast as of 2 pm. There was an error ref. code of S0a00 on all boxes, Comcast was called at 3 pm by me and I was advised that my bill is current and the services will return later on within the day. I arrived home at 4:30 pm and, to my surprise, my service was still off. My wife called Comcast and spoke to Wayne who stated that a technician would be out on 12/31/09 between 12 pm to 2 pm. Then I was missing all my sports events, college bowl games and the NFL games. I got the Sport packages which is not servicing me at all.Customer service rep tried to assist my wife with no avail and stated that he would work on this issue by trying to get a technician to come earlier than the last day of the year. When I got home at 9 pm and service was still not on, I called Comcast and advised the customer rep that this was not acceptable. I need some someone here asap. To add insult to injury, the customer service rep advised me that the earliest that someone could see me was not 12/31/09 but 1/1/10. If there was any way possible to get rid of Comcast as my cable service, I would have done it yesterday. Comcast service sucks. I am very angry that I am missing my football. This is the only reason I got cable - to watch the various football games only available on cable!"
1,I have been having trouble with my phone ever since I switched to Comcast. Several techs have been here to try to fix it but to no avail. I was told to contact Comcast when my service is interrupted so they can send someone out. My phone has been out for over 24 hours. I can't call because my phone doesn't work. I need my phone. My health is poor. Please send someone out ASAP. Thank you.
1,"I have had many problems with my Comcast internet service. Last Monday, I called and complained once again on how my internet wasn't working. I was to be home the next day so someone from the service center could come by from 2:00pm - 5:00pm. I sat home 3 days before Christmas for this person to come. At 4:30pm I called Comcast again, and they told me that I had to call back at 5:00pm to complain. So at 5:00pm I called back not too happy that I sat home for 3 hours waiting for someone that never came. An escalated ticket was sent out and now I had to be at home from 5:00pm - 7:00pm. Again, no one showed up. Today is Thursday, December 24, and I still do not have a working internet. I complained to supervisors and they were very unprofessional and obviously not doing their job. I am so unhappy with this service and have told all my friends not to use Comcast. I am at a friend’s house right now using their computer to send this e-mail. Your customer service is horrible."
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for more than 10 years. Comcast has been advertising for over a year about the transition to digital TV and advising customers who have cable that we will receive the digital signal with no interruptions and no extra cost. Now this past October 2009, I was required to get a model DC50X digital box for my cable-ready TV to receive basic signal as have all the people in my area. I have learned from my own experience and one of their own contract technicians that Comcast has been fraudulently billing customers for the latest, now required box. Here's how it goes: They ship out up to two of the boxes free and the customer installs it. Very simple - two wires and a power cord. When you call for a signal, the box won't activate. Comcast sends a tech out, who merely makes a phone call back to Comcast, and it's up and running. Then the customer gets billed $50 to $70 for what they call a failed customer install! In my case, I had other service issues not related to this. I hadn't even installed my boxes at this time and they still billed me for this failed customer install. Comcast is clearly defrauding customers with this latest effort to recoup money for hardware we never should have needed in the first place. Now they want the customer to pay for the fix."
1,"Comcast added a service I did not request and billed me for it. I have called more than three times, each time after my monthly bill arrived. Each time I have been billed the past three months. I have been billed for the unauthorized service despite my requests to have it removed and credited. I have been billed for three months for a service I have not requested. I have made numerous calls to no avail. I am contacting an attorney and filing with the FCC and BBB."
1,"My Comcast specials ran out; cable TV and high speed internet. My bill went up. I knew they would. I spoke to customer care to get the rates adjusted and they did. The six-month specials again ran out. If the subscriptions started at the same time, why if they run for six months? Wouldn't they expire at the same time? Also, my last three conversations with Comcast customer care have resulted in inaccurate and misleading information concerning what and how was needed to qualify for various services."
1,"I came back from vacation, turned on my television, only to read a notice that all TV's had to have a new digital box in order receive the channels from Comcast. A few days later, I noticed the same notice on my computer screen, which is hooked up by Windows Media Center. I called the number on the screen and made the request for two digital boxes. I hooked one up to the TV, which worked by the remote control, and created no problem. The second however was hooked up to my computer. My computer records movies, TV programs that I had set in advance for days and different channels and times. It had been working fine until it was required to use the new digital box. Now, I cannot record anything on a schedule because the box is sending a signal which can only be reached by channel 3. I have been trying for weeks now to have Windows Media Center people walk me through a way to upgrade this problem. They are telling me that I need an IR blaster cable, which does not have a place to be inserted into the remote that has been given to me by Comcast. So I talked Comcast to ask them to have a service person come out to the home to fix this problem. I waited, until the given day, and then finally someone came out, only to tell me that there was nothing that they could do, that this was a new problem, and no action was trained on this matter. Problem is I can't find anyone willing to fix this problem. The box created the problem and the program says at the end of programming that it cannot find the IR cable. Now, I am paying for service that I no longer receive."
1,"I made a previous complaint concerning the discourteous and shoddy service of several Comcast employees. In early September, my 32"" Vizio television was damaged by a Comcast representative. He came out to downgrade my service to basic cable, took out the cable box, left the cables attached to the television, and blew the circuit board in the television. I called Comcast and filled out a damage report. They told me that a person would contact me within six weeks to schedule someone to come and look at the television and determine the damage. A representative came out on 29th September to try and fix the problem but to no avail. Soon after, I was contacted by a person named Linda at ** and we arranged for someone to come on 13th October, 2009 between the hours of 2 and 5 pm to pick up the television. When they determined the problem, (blown circuit board), Linda called me back and asked whether I wanted to have the television repaired or would I rather receive a check for it. Since they could not guarantee that we would not have any more problems with it after it was fixed, my husband and I decided to just take the check for the cost of the television after its depreciated cost and purchase another one. She informed us that we could not receive that (even though we should have been entitled to that amount) but would rather only be given the cost of repairing the TV.She said that she would submit the paperwork and, within six weeks, we would receive a check from Comcast. After the stipulated time had come and gone, I proceeded to call her repeatedly, to find out what had happened to my check. After several irate messages, I finally got in contact with her and she said that she no longer had my television and was not in charge of sending out the check. She gave me the name of the person in charge of sending out my check. This was a Ms. Sharon 88 of Connex at **. When I first contacted her, she was very insistent that she had already mailed out my check; however, when she checked, she realized that that was not so. She said that she had to submit more paperwork and that someone would contact me within a day or two to confirm some information before they sent out my check. After several days of not being contacted, I called her back and left her a message to call me. She never returned my call. Instead, I called back and when she heard my voice, she pretended like we had a bad phone connection and hung up on me. I made three calls back during which she picked up the phone and hung up each time. On the fourth call, she allowed it to go to voice mail and I left a message asking her to just return my television because I would be seeking legal advice concerning the matter. I have still not been contacted by anyone."
1,"On the evening of December 18th, I called Comcast to report a service problem for the cable TV. I was connected to Courtney in Lafayette, LA. After providing her with my name, address, telephone number and partial social security number, she found my account but could not help me unless I additionally supplied the account number or in lieu of that - the amount of my last payment. As I pay the bill online, I did not have this readily available. Yet she still would not assist me because of security issues. I asked to speak with the supervisor, who refused to speak with me on two occasions.I fail to see why a simple request to pass on to service personnel that there is a difficulty at a specific address or area is a security risk either for the company or the person calling in. I realize people have procedures, but they also need to use some common sense. In addition, a request to speak to the supervisor who might have authority to intercede with simple requests is the norm. At best, the quality of the Comcast transmission is spotty but the service dept seems to be even worse."
1,"My aunt moved from Los Gatos to San Jose into a retirement home. She had to give up her phone number in Los Gatos (which she had for 30 years) and get a new one in the San Jose. Changing numbers is not ideal, but the least you'd expect is that Comcast could put a greeting on the old (Los Gatos) number to direct callers to the new number. After dealing with Comcast 4 times, I get told that they cannot do that, for technical reasons. The old number has never been assigned to anybody else though, it just says ""the call cannot be completed"", but there is no reference to the new number."
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for almost six years only because they are the only cable company in my area. In the last year, I have had nothing but problems with their service and their customer service. At my apartment, it took six tech visits and four months for them to diagnose a problem and then explained that they could not fix it but they had no problem charging me for five of the visits. When I asked for a credit to my bill because I was without service or had partial services, they refused to credit my account. When I moved into my new home, they made me wait over a week to install services. Not totally their fault, but because I work from home, I lost out on wages due to my inability to be online. Yes, I know I could have gone somewhere to access public Wi-Fi, but that wasn't the point. Now that I have received my first bill, I am stunned to see that not only am I paying $40 more a month but I was nickel-and-dimed on everything. I signed up for a bundle service and it’s more? Upon calling, the representative was rude and could not help me even though they have a 30-day money back guarantee. I explained that I didn't feel that I was getting my money's worth and the guy had the audacity to tell me I was definitely getting my money's worth as if he has insight to my life and my financial situation. They have to be the worst company when it comes to value and customer service."
1,"Comcast changed my internet service from Road Runner Lite Service at $19.95 per month to Performance Service at $29.99 per month without any prior notification and made this change retroactive to November 1st, 2009. I called to protest this change and they agreed to reinstate my rate until December 15, 2010. I told them I didn't believe they had the right to change the cost of my service without prior notification and that I would pursue the issue with the Department of Consumer Affairs in an effort to force them to honor my original rate indefinitely."
1,"I had a scheduled appointment with Comcast to install cable service which is close to $200 a month. When I scheduled, they told me to be home between 2 and 5. At 5:30, I called and my request was still in the computer. They then told me the tech called at 4:10 and since I did not answer, they put it in the system that I was not home. They then canceled my installation service. Comcast has never called before to see if I am home before they arrive. They have always shown up. The tech decided to skip my appointment, go to the next appointment, and finish out everyone. I called and the best that Comcast could do was reschedule or email the tech. They did not know when the tech supervisor would reply or when they would come out. I scheduled the appointment two weeks out due to my busy work schedule. The drive to work takes 45 minutes. I drove home and waited four hours for service. I had to return to work another 45 minutes and now it will take me almost two months to have free time from work in order to get any type of service. The point of the service was for family to watch TV for the holidays when visiting."
1,"Comcast has consistently and continuously been the hardest cable/internet provider by far. They have absolutely no regard for their customers. I paid over $80 just for continuing to receive internet service and got a phone call by a CSR stating that they were going to cut off my service. I realized that it was probably just a mistake but after speaking to two separate CSR's, I was told that I was going to be cut off anyway even though I had the CSR's names and a confirmation number that I had already paid. Unbelievable! They call you at 6am on Sunday morning letting you know that your bill is coming up soon. Comcast is plain, outright in your face rude and extremely unprofessional. My ex-wife was extremely rude and I got rid of her. Do not even think about calling Comcast for your internet and TV services. They do not care about their customers. They do not care about you!"
1,"Why do I need a television with a tuner in it anymore? Comcast is changing to a ""gotta have our little box to receive anything above channel 30 now."" I can understand a satellite receiver needing a special receiver for systems like Dish Network and DirecTV, you know going into the contract with those providers that you're not going to get the same kind of product, and as far as I know, they haven't changed their service since implementation, but Comcast? Why the heck did I spend $210 on a new digital tuner (purchased through Best Buy with no mention that it would become obsolete in 12 months)? Why the heck am I required to use a special piece of hardware to suddenly support Comcast's signal? I'm more than a little miffed that the digital tuner I bought last year is now worthless scrap. For that matter, what the heck is wrong with the digital tuner that came with the television I bought last year? Why do any televisions in the northwest need tuners at all if there is basically no service provider sending a signal that is compliant with a standard or HD television signal?At one time, there were standards. Standards that meant you could plug something into something else and you knew it would work because it was built to a standard. Standards were meant to protect the industry, the consumer, and in a small way, the government that embraced that standard and endorsed it. The 110 volt wall outlet is a beautiful example. I can pretty much be guaranteed that if I plug a three prong electrical cord into it, I'm going to be able to power a 110 volt device. Today though, even if I've got what looks like a cable for TV, I can no longer be guaranteed that what's there is going to be interpreted as a standard signal my television can consume. I'm very disappointed with the mishmash of products that were allowed to be sold in the US if they were going to become scrap within a year or two. Someone should have indicated the digital tuner program we were saddled with was a pure bunch of bunk. The only thing I can see is that it took the cover off the top of Pandora's box and now all television service providers can do anything they want."
1,"I was approached to switch from my DirecTV service to Comcast Cable for the bundle deal on Nov. 1, 2009. I was told to switch my cable, phone and internet for a really good deal. And yes, the deal did sound good so I said, ""Why not. We will give it a try."" They scheduled me like two weeks later for install because they needed to wait for my Verizon phone numbers to be ported. Well on Nov. 21st, the first guy came out and he was such a whiner about how much cable he would have to run from the pole to the house, etc. I thought I would have to pay for that and with him being such a whiner, I didn't have much confidence anyway. I said, ""Just cancel this order. I don't want it!"" Well of course the sales rep called me and I was convinced he would make sure it would go better this time. So I was scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 28th. Well the tech that came out said he could not run the line in our underground pipe to the house, but would call for there contractors to get a line through it. I was also told my number was not ported, so I would have been given different phone numbers. I told them in the beginning that I needed our phone numbers (my husband has his own business). So that was a problem. Plus they didn't even think I would get service because the cable box on the telephone pole was too far away. Anyway the contractors came out the same day and for two hours my husband tried to help them, but the contractors jammed a piece of foam down in the pipe so they could not get a line through. So with no luck, they gave up for the night. On that Sunday, my husband went and got his compressor. He was able to blow the line out for them and we snaked a line through to make it easier for Comcast to get the job done. Okay, so now to the final Saturday wasted on Comcast was on December 12, 2009. I was given a time of 11-1:00PM and was told my phone numbers would be ready for install. Well 1:30 went by and my kids and I saw a Comcast truck go by, but never came in the driveway. I called at 2:00 and explained to them the tech was not here yet. She said it shows them arriving at my house at 1:30. Not! They went by at 1:30! They sent someone else out here, who arrived at 2:30. I asked him how long it would take because I had plans in the early evening. I also told him to make sure they had my phone numbers ported and he told me to hold on and he would call and check. He was on the phone for awhile, so I called Comcast directly and talked to a nice tech named Bob. He said he would call back and let me know if my numbers were ported. Meanwhile the install guy got off the phone and said, ""No, your numbers are not going to be ported and ready till Dec.14th."" I said what! This was supposed to be done, ready to go. I said, ""Forget it. I'm done with Comcast."" I don't want to deal with them anymore. So the tech called Comcast and canceled. So now the tech from Comcast called me back and he said my numbers were ready to go. I said, ""What! Your install tech told me they were not ready."" Anyway, this was my nightmare experience. They offered me when I installed a gift card of $75 to Walmart and I emailed my sales rep and told him I still want my gift card for all the time and aggravation I had to put up with. I'm sure they won't, but I deserve at least that. Thank you."
1,"What happened to quite a few channels on my system which have been removed by your company? I noticed that a few nights ago when surfing through the stations, some in the teens and some higher up were gone. Does this mean that the cable service is cutting back without any reduction in our monthly amount? Please advise ASAP. Thank you. There should be a reduction in price of the monthly bill with these reductions in service."
1,"I believe that Comcast is engaging in deceptive practices. Comcast claims that the new DTA cable boxes are necessary for them to be able to offer more HD programs. But when the box is used, there are less HD programs available. The only way to get the additional, and some of the previously available basic cable (non-HD included) programs, is to upgrade to the HD box that is available for a monthly fee. This boils down to the need for the DTA box to receive basic cable and upgrade to get HD. Also, an annoying symptom of this need for the DTA boxes is a limiting of some of the features of HDTV sets. Example: The use of the picture-in-picture feature is limited to the few channels still available through a direct cable hook up (no box), even if an HD box is being used as the primary tuner. This condition makes it nearly impossible to watch one program while recording another. Another lost feature is the ability to use the TV set's own on-screen channel info."
1,"I canceled Comcast service at the end of October 2009. I had a refund of over $93. After waiting 6 weeks for my check to arrive, it finally arrived (with the amount of $5.73). I called customer service and was told that Comcast did a query using my phone number and mistakenly linked it with a former account that also had the same number (in the past). Without any further research (perhaps by customer SS#), they determined that it was my account that had the balance and decided with take the $88. I was told that my case would have to go to collections now, which means that Comcast is again withholding my money for an undisclosed amount of time. I informed them that I would be writing the FCC about Comcast's bad business practices, as well as the BBB. I was then given the Executive Office's number and told to call them."
1,"A Comcast representative came to our home to see if we wanted to upgrade to add internet and phone to our present cable. He quoted a price of $95.85 for all three services which included our present cable. It has been impossible to have the agreement, which he gave us in writing, implemented. We went to the office in Wheat Ridge, CO and were promised a supervisor would call. She never did. We went to Comcast Chat services twice and were sent back to New Customer Service. New Customer Service sent me back to Chat. We called Customer Service and were promised a supervisor would call right back. No one ever called. Never listen to a Comcast door to door representative and it is a waste of your time to try to get anything resolved through Customer Service. The best bet is, try another company."
1,"I had an appointment with a technician to come to the house to install a cable for internet access and to check the connection for HD TV (not receiving a signal). They were to be out on Dec. 8, 2009 between 8 and 11 am. They said the technician showed up at 11:05 and no one was home. You would have to believe with 4 vehicles and 3 people at the house with garage open that someone had to be there. When I called, they said a dispatcher would contact me before 2 at the number I gave them to call which the lady on the phone even verified was the number to be contacted. I never received a call. When I called the number again, they said a technician would be out between then and 8 pm and was a must do. When I called back at 7:45 pm, they said the technician called and had no answer which is bull because it's my cell and I had on me for one reason - to answer Comcast's call and there is no number listed and I know they didn't call or it would be listed on my cell."
1,"Comcast called and asked if we would like to save money by having all services - cable, Internet and phone - on one bill. They promised a bill of $19.99 per month for phone, but charged lots of extra fees - $5.40 for having a non-published number and $5.00 for phone equipment plus lots of taxes and other fees.I tried to get the phone equipment charge and non-published number charge but they refused to do so. If their service doesn't work without a box, like other services did, then they shouldn't be allowed to charge for this. They also would not tell how much the box really costs, and don't have an option to buy one instead of paying a monthly charge for it for Infinity. Also, it doesn't cost any money to not publish a phone number, so charging a consumer for not publishing a phone number is outright highway robbery. I am looking for an attorney to sue this company, but heard that people aren't allowed to sue Comcast anymore."
1,"   Comcast Some Staffs working at Rockville, MD 20850 are very rude! and gave me wrong information.I have never seen such rude customer services in this country. I was mentally tortured by them. Their rudeness intimidated me and the wrong information that two staffs gave me misled me. But I didn't give up and kept looking for chances to get what I paid for. After waiting in the lengthy line again and again,  finally I found a staff who are able to help me. But again, she is extremely rude as well. "
1," We refused to sign his paper because Comcast said there would be no charge for the checkup.  The tech said if we didn't sign he would not get paid, so we signed.  We are now getting a charge on our bill plus late fees for the service call.  It turned out not to be our house, but the actual cable line in our town period.  I called and spoke to a rep and it was going to be removed from the bill.  It wasn't, and I got a late fee. In addition, during our phone call to Comcast we were told that we didn't need a converter box.  I told them I didn't have a converter box, that it had been taken back to their carrolltown office (Adelphia at that time) in 1998.  Katie then looked back on her records, stated to me that it was a non-billable charge anyway. ( I had been paying for the box all that time) and that Comcast owed me over $816.00.  We asked for a refund.  I was told ""NO"".  We will give you a $20 credit. Sumara at the Pittsburgh office transferred us to Brian, who said that if we didn't have proof that the box was returned then he didn't need to give us anything, plus he was very rude to us for asking.  We explained that his Comcast rep is the one that told us that Comcast owed us the money because we were being billed for a non-billable item.  All our bills would show that, so even if we had the box it was not a charge that should have been on the bill. All we wanted was the service charge and the late fee removed, and they won't even do that.  How do we convince them to do the right thing? Physical damage: unnecessary holes put in my house to run wire that was not needed. Economic: we are old and on a SS: income. We can't afford extra bills, and we could use the money they owe us to put some oil in this winter.  Personally: We have had Comcast (and whomever they bought out along the line) for over 30 years and we feel that we should be treated fairly, or they should have to answer to someone. We can't be the only ones that got charged a non-billable charge, and the ones that have not discoved it are probably still paying it.

1," My comcast FL bill was changed to an address in Cartersville, GA without my authorization.  I have no relations, friends, or family, nor have I ever been to Cartersville, GA.  It is unacceptable that I should lose my telephone number due to the carelessness of Comcast Cable.  Losing my telephone number is not an option. "
1,"   I have been a Comcast customer since they took over my previous provider.  So about 6 years now.  For the past two months, my service (cable, phone & internet.) have been non usable.  I called Comcast the first I noticed this.  They said they would send a technician to my home to see what was going on.  Well the day came and gone that the tech was to come out.  The problem is getting worse.  So I call again and reschedule.  Again the day comes and goes.  So by now I am very annoyed!  I call again.  They claim he came out and no one was home.  I said not true.  I took off work and was home all day as well as my wife who works from home.  The customer service rep argued with me to the point I hung up.  I thought was petty to fight about. So I call back and got another appointment scheduled.  The day comes and the tech actually shows up!!  He discovered a my cable box was defective and the line running into my house was bad.  He fixed it the best he could, until they could replace the line.  Comcast calls me the next day to let me know that on November 22nd they will be repairing my line outside.  I said GREAT!  Well the 22nd comes and goes. No repair. Mean while I'm paying 160 a month for nothing.  I call back to find out what is going on.  The rep puts me on hold for 20 minutes.  She returns saying, when a truck in available they will be out.  I said WHAT?!  You gave me a date and time.  She said they never did.  I said fine. A week goes by nothing.  I call back. Talk to a rep who gives me an excuse ""when we get permission from the twp. We can then do the repair."" I said ok this is new.  I call my twp office.  They told me they gave them the go ahead a week ago.  So I call Comcast back.  I was on the phone for an hour, arguing trying to get this repaired.  The rep told me I was inconsiderate, knew nothing about my services and hung up on me. At this point I looked up the local office here for Comcast.  I drive there and had to pretend I was a delivery person to get in the building.  I find the office and ask to speak to someone in charge.  A gentle men comes and talks with me.  I explain to him the situation and how I was getting the run around and treated.  He said there is nothing he can do.  I asked for a credit on my bill since I paid for service I cannot use.  He credited me a whole 36.88!  I told him to eat his credit and canceled service.  I ordered Verizon and Love them.  I will never use Comcast again!So by now I am very annoyed!  I call again.  They claim he came out and no one was home.  I said not true.  I took off work and was home all day as well as my wife who works from home.

1,"   My wife & I recently moved a short distance within the same city, and transferred our Comcast service to our new house, canceling the service at the old house simultaneously. When they installed equipment at our new house, they did not do a good job, and that is another nightmare story. But later, we also noticed that we were being double billed for both addresses for a month or two. After many hours on hold, we finally got a rep to tell us that it was their mistake, & that theyd send us a refund check, which we thought should be at least $200. We got a check for $20 and 84 cents, so we still figure were owed around $180. After many more attempts, and an online chat, Comcast said that I would have to visit the local Comcast office, which I did. I waited there another hour, & was amazed at the long line of angry customers, and only one customer service rep there to help people. Again, they agreed that we were owed money, and that theyd credit our account. Next month, we get our invoice with no such credit. If anyone knows of, or would like to organize a class action law suit against Comcast, wed be interested in seeing some justice!"
1,"   service was insalled with used equipment,installer was rude, and uncooperative. had a few of no service because wrong equipment was installed, another man came and corrected ,service was good for a few days,then my outside line was tapped with a splitter by another serviceman to supply my neighbor with service, resulting in a weak signal and poor video service,i complained and a new man came and ran a new line from the pole and said theres a problem at the pole some other guy came and worked on pole but i still have poor video, i have been billed almost 500.00 for the first month of which i have still have poor video i even went to the personal expence of installing a signal booster and for a few days i had good video after that i have had poor video since ,apparently comcast is unable to provide watchable television to me and i dont think i should have to pay such high prices for a system that doesent work. what do i need to do to get watchable t v and why should i pay for this type of service,"
1,"I called then and their computers were conveniently down.  I then called the tech who never left a work order with me.  He amazingly got into the computer and said it was a mistake.  I said you did this to others in here.  I have spoken to several people who subcribe to comcast and they have the same prbolem.  I filed a complaint with the federal trade commission for this illegal billing of something I did not get.  The change over started in september.  Many still don't have boxes the excuse is they have to get them.  This is poor business practice and then to bill me on top of it is totally uncalled for.  I Hope our government agency puts as stop to this switch and bait billing.  I don't like to receive bills for something I did not get.  There are seniors who just pay bills and it is time we watch out for them.  It is about time someone put a stop to this.  
I did finally get the bill taken care of playing phone tag being transferred several times.  I was on the phone for several days.  If I had a choice I would never do business with them I would rather not watch tv than put up with this stress who is protecting the consumers.  They were suppose to call each person for setting up a box they did not call me at all.   I only caught a tech who hooked up a defective modem and told me my tv was out. My tv is working fine. He put another box in.  After my complaint he walks out the door and the cable box quits working.  I had to call again.  I am entitled to receive what I pay for within a reasonable amount of time.

1,"monopoly in my state, they are priced well out of range for many average income families. I was without internet service for over a month because of an error on their part and never compensated except for offering me a $20 discount on that months bill. I asked for wireless, but it was not installed and therefore can't use any of the itouch products my family has. In order to get someone to fix that I will have to pay through the nose to have someone come set it up. I have never been so disappointed with service from any company and can't wait until the day I have an alternative to using them!"
1,"   Since we had this company through different names,our cable programs have been interupted by means of bad transmission of programing.I have reported bad cable reception ma times but, thetny always give me an excuse and never once offered money off or free cable for a while. More often then not some channels go out or don't come in right. Something needs to be done about the way we are treated as customers. When we get bad cable we should be reembursed for the times we could not use our cable. I pay about 73.00 a month for this service and I want to have good service for the money I have spent but, I wish now I would have complained to you sooner. Is there any relief from this bad business with comcast? I would like money off my bill for all the times I had to go with out good cable. Please report this and do what ever you can to help this bad programing cable scam.  Undo stress from cable that is unable to watch. My wife and I rely on the cable stations but, get negative feed back,pay your bill or we will turn you off. Never how can we be of service to you. My wife lies in bed most of the time and watches the tv. When the cable messes up and nothing is done to make up for it that depresses my wife and myself enough to effect our lives as we know them. We pay for programming that we do not get and that is just not right.  Undo stress from cable that is unable to watch.

My wife lies in bed most of the time and watches the tv. When the cable messes up and nothing is done to make up for it that depresses my wife and myself enough to effect our lives as we know them. We pay for programming that we do not get and that is just not right. "
1,"   I called Comcast on Aug 21, 2009 and was told that all I had to pay to get my digital turned back on was $171.38. I asked if that inlcuded the surcharge and was told no, when I called back a week later I was told I had to pay over $350.00 to have my sevice turned back on plus a $5.00 surcharge. I paid the bill and htought I would not have to deal with them again until my next bill was due. I got my next bill about a month after I payed the full amount and it was for $350.00 dollars and if I didn't pay by Oct. 17th I would be shut off, then on Oct. 11th they shut off my digital cable and phone service. I received a bill today from them the second since they turned off my phone and digital cable and they are still charging me for digital cable and phone service. I want to know how this is possible how can I be charged for a product I am not even using, and if I call and ask them they never give me a answer but tell me I must pay for it. The total bill is $698.00 dollars and over $350.00 of that is for services I don't have since I didn't pay for 2 months at one time.I received a bill today from them the second since they turned off my phone and digital cable and they are still charging me for digital cable and phone service.

1,"   This summer Comcast went to a new billing system. When I received my first ""new bill"", the charges were not correct.  They only charged me for the movies we had purchased from on demand.  I called Comcast to get the correct total and told them that I owed more than the bill stated.  The rep assured me that my bill was correct.  I spent 12 minutes (according to my cell phone records) trying to convince the rep the bill was wrong. I finally asked to to look at the bill and see how much I was charged for the cable service.  She said, oh, I see what you mean and asked me to hold.  When she came back she stated that my bill was indeed correct and that it was all I owed. I stated that that could not be and she stated they were having a ""promotion"".  I stated that I lived on a budget and did not want to get a big bill down the road and would she please see that my account was corrected. The next month the billing was still not right.  Again I called and tried to convince the rep my bill was wrong.  No, it's not.  That's all you owe I was told.  Again I stated that I did not want to get a big bill down the road. I was assured again that the amount stated on the bill was all that I owed. In September I got a bill for $295.16 for the services that had not been previously billed.  Again I called and asked why I was billed when I was told that I didn't owe anything other than what was on the billing statement.  I was told that there was a record I had called in but nothing about a problem with the billing.  I stated again that I could not pay this all at once and was assured that I could ""take all the time I needed"" to get the bill caught up. When my next statement came in it had a note that my service would be discontinued if the balance was not paid in full.  Once again, I called to explain the situation to the rep.  I was assured that my account would be flagged and that my service would not be interruped.  During this time I made weekly payments online to try to catch the bill up.  My service was interrupted.  This time I went on line to chat with a rep.  I explained the whole situation again and was told the bill had to be paid in full before service could be restored.  How could they turn off my service when it was their billing error, not mine, and I had made every effort to correct the situation.  All the rep had to do was look at my billing history to see that what I was saying was the truth. I managed to get the bill paid in full and now this month they have actually charged me late fees and collection charges.  Unbelievable.  Unfortunately I cannot discontinue service because my husband is disabled and he enjoys the free movies offered although we do purchase them occasionally.  We have been Comcast customers for years and years and usually purchase the baseball package every summer.  I don't know how they reps are being trained, but evidently it's just tell the customer what they want to hear and go on to the next.  I am extremely disappointed that Comcast would treat their customers this way.  If we ever are able to switch companies we will. The only damage was that I had to let other bills go in order to get our service restored for my husband since I had to pay the bill in full and not ""take all the time I needed"" to fix their error.

1,"   In the month of November our services(phone,internet,and cable) with Comcast were cut off due to non payment. On Friday November 20th I had payed my bill to current status. When I called on Friday from my work phone(because I do not have a phone at home and no cell phone)Comcast said that they were going to send a technician out on Saturday from 8am-11am to set my service back up. I stayed home from work and I was up and ready at 8am. At 10:30am on 11/21/09 the techincian left a door tag saying he had missed me. I was there and there was no knock on the door. So I called again and told the man what happened. He said someone would be coming back out later that day. No one came. I called on Sunday 11/25/09 from my apartment leasing office. She said that she would call the technician and try to see if they could come out. She asked if I could stay were I was at to give me a call back. So I waited and waited for 2 hours in the leasing office. No call from Comcast. Then I called again on Sunday 11/25/09 and I talked to a lady named Heidi.Heidi was nice and sweet but she did not know what the heck she was talking about. She told us that we would have to have new equipment because our equipment was old. Not true at all. We have the updated versions of everything trust me, my husband wouldn't allow us to have outdated electronics. Then she said that we have to have another installation done on Sunday from 4pm to 8pm. I called on Sunday evening from Kroger which is a grocery store because I have no phone. When I called this time they said yes that a technician will be out and to be expecting him. Around 8:40pm no one had shown up. 
I went back to Kroger used the phone and finally talked to a lady named Ms.B. After all this run around she told me the truth saying that the technicians don't work on Sundays and they will not be out today. Then she explained that we don't have to be home because all the technician has to do is hook it back up from the box in the back of the apartment. She told me that they would be out on Monday to hook it up. Monday morning, 1 cable box is hooked up but the other t.v , phone and internet is not hooked up yet. So I called again and the lady sent a signal for the other t.v. to work which it did then she said someone is to be out Monday night for the phone and internet connection. No one came again. I called again on Tuesday 11/24/09 and spoke to a lady and said they would be out on Tuesday from 2-5p. My husband was home and no one showed up for the 3rd time. Tuesday evening and my husband called this time they said that our modem was on hold for the internet and phone. Why? I have no idea. They never told me why. So on Wednesday I called again and I told the lady and she transferd me to a guy and would finally resolve the issue. He took the modem off hold. I am sending this to you because there is no reason for this miscommunication from the employees at Comcast and they need inform the customers the correct information and not what they want to hear. Comcast has clearly not understood what it means about customer service. They give customers the run around. They also are quick to turn your service off when you don't make a payment but when you do make the payment they are not as quick to turn the service back on. I work and train on customer service to new employees. I would never train my employees to tell the customer what they want to hear and not get the issue resolved. Get the issue resolved period.

1,"   This started when I moved back in May of this year (2009). When I got to my apt. I transferred over my Comcast Cable and Internet. About 3 days later both my internet and cable were shut off. I called and the person I spoke with stated that I had requested for my services to be shut off. Now why would I shut off services I just had turned on? So for 2 weeks I had neither. So I had them, of course, fix this. I was suppose to be on a new special because of this issue when I moved into the house I am residing in. This is in July of this year (2009). Unfortunately since I did not hold their hand and make sure that some one was doing their job I am missing 2 months of the ""special"" discount. Now while this do not mean much I was counting on this.  I called last Saturday, November 21st and was told that a supervisor would reach me. I called today and was put on hold for about half an hour waiting for a supervisor. Then I was told by supervisor that there was nothing he could do for me. Also no supervisor called me because there was never a request for one. I am really getting tired of Comcast and their non existent customer service.

1,"   I was one month late on my bill on 11/16/09 (160.00) for a billing cycle from 10/14 - 11/14, my services were interrupted. I contacted cable regarding the amount due, i was told one price and asked if I wanted to make my payment over the phone, I declined as I knew that someone would have to come to my home to reconnect.  I was transferred and then told that I needed to pay 330.00 because a new bill had gone out for services 11/14 - 12/14. I asked why do I have to pay for services not yet received especially since I was disconnected before the new bill came out.  I was told that is there policy and that the entire amount needed to be paid in cash (no debit/credit card) would be accepted. My services include cable, internet and phone thus I have no phone service at all."
1,   I called to see if I could buy my own cable TV/telephone/internet modem and was told I could not because of its telephone interface.  They raised the monthly rental from $3.00 to $5.00 (a 60% increase) and I have no recourse becuase competitors are not available (FiOS is not available and satellite dishes are not allowed).  Therefore Comcast essentially has a monopoly.  That means I am paying $60 per year or $300 over 5 years for a simple modem.  A major ripoff with no alternatives!!  The Public Service Commission in Maryland does not regulate the cable providers and the local county cable administration says there is nothing they can do.  Can you help??
1,"   Comcast has started scrambling the digital signal to all subscribers in my area. I have a digital TV that will now only get channels 2-31, instead of all the channels I pay for. Comcast requires me to pay for an additional converter box in order to receive the channels I pay for. My digital TV now is limited to an analog signal, and I have lost all of the advantages and digital features of my TV. I have asked for a de-scrambler, but Comcast says they don't have that technology available. Since they are scrambling the signal to protect from theft, they should automatically de-scramble the signal to paying customers. They do that, but only in conjunction with a converter box that converts the signal to analog. They only allow 1 set-top box and 2 converters per household. If you need more, you must pay $1.99 per month for each extra converter. Our digital TV's are now getting analog signals, and we are paying extra for it!"
1,"   I moved in August 2009 and transferred my Comcast service to my new address. I pay my bill in full and on time. I kept getting bills for my old address and when I contacted a CSR over Comcast's chat service, I was told that that account was closed and that I would not see any more bills. Well, today I got another one, for two months' worth of payments. I called at 8:45 AM. I spoke with a CSR who told me that the account had been sent to collections and she transferred me there. When I spoke with the collections agent she told me that there was still a modem at my old address which was why I was being charged. I explained that I didn't live there anymore. She told me that I would have to prove that I had returned the modem by bringing a receipt into a Comcast store. Well -- I don't have the receipt. She said that I would have to prove it. I said: ""are you telling me that for the rest of my life, I will be charged for service, because I can't find the receipt?"" She said, AGAIN: you have to prove that you returned it. I asked to speak to someone else and she told me no one was available and that I would have to leave my phone number with her. Again, I asked her if I would continue being charged until the day I died for this service. She said yes, you will be charged $45. I asked ""per month, or a one-time charge?"" And she said ""a one-time charge."" Why didn't she say that in the first place? Answer? I didn't ask.So one final time, I asked why I was being charged for service that had been transferred, and she sent me back to customer service. Well--this CSR looked into it, and found out that Comcast had forgotten to turn off my service at my old residence. So, it was their fault all along! She said that they would be crediting me the money and closing the account. I will believe it when I see it. And she did not once apologize or take responsibility on Comcast's behalf for this error. And I am still mad about that collections representative.When I spoke with the collections agent she told me that there was still a modem at my old address which was why I was being charged.

1,"We never talk to someone local, it's someone in a different state, like Tennessee. I use the internet for business and when it isn't working, I can't work. I am sick to death of this!!"
1,"   This all started about a year and a half ago with outside cables being left above ground until someone tripped. They were negligent until i called the corporate office and then it was corrected and I was compensated. Then I had trouble with a TV burning out from having their cable box connected. I got no where with that. Then my  home phones stopped working and it took several visits only to tell me I should by the cordless with one reciever. Next, my so called promotion ran out and my bill went up $100. Currently, my DVR box stopped working and I was told to return it. After a few days I finally made it there and the new box would not work for three days when someone was on the way to fix it. Customer service has been horrible and their advice has sucked ( sorry for the language). Currently they have some much better promotions and I am told I can not switch over. They also have been billing me for an extra DVR box for a while now and i have to wait five days for an answer. To me this is absolutly unacceptable and I have o choice but to switch over services.Next, my so called promotion ran out and my bill went up $100.

1,"   They are taking people money. I worked for them an got the inside scoop. They will lie to keep business and sugar coat the true. Why should you pay comcast all that money when can get it online on your pc and home tv. i get 3,500 hd channel for one time fee of $49.00."
1,"On Nov 10, 2009 I called Comcast Cable in reference to my internet. I was told that Comcast would be out on Friday 13, 2009 my wife took off that day she can wait for the cable company. Around 1:15 I called Comcast to see if they was running later. I was told that the appointment was cancel on the 11. When I ask why the apointment was cancel no reason was gving.I was told that they come back this Wed between 2-5. I am trying to run a business and I keep having a lot of problems with Comcast. The service is really poor. I have filled with the FCC and BBB several times against Comcast. In the neighborwe live in we are only alow to get Comcast. I have talk to some people out side of this area and to find out with the same service I have other customer are paying about 50.00 dollar less a month. Not only are we getting poor service we are being ripped off. The level of customer is really poor. I really hate dealing with this company. You would think in a bad economy company would do want ever they need to help their customer.In the neighborwe live in we are only alow to get Comcast.

1,   Comcast tells me with the exception of one channel change I can get the same cable tv service at a much discounted price (along with 1 year contract) but NOw I'm told that no! this is not available.  Apparently what was said and done are two different things.
1,   I have been contacting them for over two months to remove a low hanging cable wire that all other utility companies say belong to them.They continue to make promises but no action.I had to get upon the roof and tie it up so that it will no longer hang.It continues to fall low enough to cause harm.
1,"   I have had cable Internet service since 2000 and never switched service to other company. My record also showed that I paid $395.45(pre paid 1year contract) since 2003. My last Internet payment was 1/11/09($395+$36.xxcable TV=$434.71, with $395 prepaid for all year). And in July 2009, I got bill which indicated that my Internet rate changed to $57.xx/month. Prior to the change, I had never received any notice regarding the rate hike. Back in June, I canceled my cable service with Comcast. At the moment, I had already confirmed with Comcast service rep that the cancellation of the cable TV would have no impact on my internet rate, because the prepaid internet service was carried over from that of previous company (the company was taken over by Comcast). For the following months, several Internet bills with increased rate were sent to me. When I called the service hotline, many service reps didn't even acknowledge the existing prepaid service rate. Finally on Oct. 5th, we had chance talking to business service manager Ron and residential service manager Jerry, they reconsidered my situation and on Oct 7th, when we talked to service rep Manu, he confirmed we should call December 10th to renew our existing prepaid service for $395.45. Unfortunately, when I called again to confirm this arrangement, the answer we got was changed again. Comcast insisted that since we canceled our cable TV service, they permanently removed the special prepaid code from my account. It is a very frustrated situation because I have already prepaid the service since the Jan of 2009, and obviously, the original term should be honored through the entire year. However, apparently the service term for the Internet was changed right after the cancellation of the cable TV. Comcast accepted my money for the entire year of the Internet service thus has to honor its own term, that's a business integrity issue. Yesterday, I again received the Internet bill and it again shows the increased rate for Internet service. So, I called again and this time, the service rep said he was in somewhere in Mexico and didn't have capabilities to deal with this matter. Since July, I have called numerous times to Comcast and almost each time, I had to spent at least an hour on the line and each time I would get different answers. Yet the problem still remains. Comcast just can't keep its promises and something has to be done!!!"
1,"Today they were here again and the tech refuse to put a 12 foot peace of cable in again he called his super and then he left again with out doing anything.So I called cable and made a complaint about this and told them not to come here anymore that if I had anymore problems I would call the FCC and comeplain to them.So I just got a call from the cable Company and they told me they are comming here this afternoon to fix the cable,and I said what I did not call the cable Company to come back here again they are driving me nuts every tech that comes here puts the other techs down and im getting tired of hereing this.The main thing here is the Cable keeps going off and on all most everyday and they tell me to call when this happens and the tech on phone runs a test and tells me the cable connection is very low and we will send a mobil tech to your house and they always come 3 to 4 hours late and by then the Cable is working again so I don't under stand why they are giving me a hard time on this when the tech in the office is seeing a problem. I tell them to talk to the office people. But to this day they have not fix the cable line and refuses to run a 12 foot peice Cable wire to fix problem."
1,   I was transferring my service from Weston Florida to Hollywood Florida I scheduled the appointment online 2 weeks in advance was told I would be able to keep same boxes they would just reprogram. so Friday the 30th I wait between 8-11 and noone shows Up I call and they say the tech left a door tag no door tag. I fight with them they set up an appointment for Halloween between 11-2 at 2pm on the dot the tech arrives we walk through i explain what we need he doesn't have my basic Digital boxes so I have to pick them up at a locations if I want them mind you Im transferring service same amount of boxes etc. then he ask me if I have a drill cause he didn't bring his I of course allow him to borrow my drill. then he ask me if I know where a home depot is cause he doesn't have a drill bit. so we both leave me to get the boxes him to get tools. I am of course giving a problem at comcast center cause they are 2 different accounts until the tech calls boxes in or some bs. anyways i get back to the house the tech is hooking everything up 4.5 hrs pass he has to go up on pole finds the tap in on the pole is broken so he calls his service center which informs him to call the line supervisor darryl which tells him to unhook someone else from tap and hook me in so he can close the call that the neighbor that loses cable will call in and they will eventually send a line team out please remember I wasnt on phone this is just what the tech told me. after that the supervisor calls back and tells him to forget the first idea and just split from the tap in with a splitter. so we then go back inside where my modem and one basic digital box isnt working and he doesnt know why so he tells me monday I can go get these replaced and then hook them up and everything should be working fine. monday i go to center and they wont give me modem a tech needs to come out after fighting 3 days later a tech comes out and gets my cable hooked up. when the first tech left I had a cable wire hanging down below 4 feet in my backyard. everyone I talk to says sorry and they will be calling me back still nothing. so 2 days ago on my flat screen i started to see a greenish purple line scrolling through tv I thought it was my tv going bad so i bought a new one come to find out its the cable maybe its cause a pole team still hasnt come out and my service isnt really working but trying to get some answers is like getting wisdom teeth pulled. and Im getting false bills for the install charging me for 6 outlets when tech only put in 4 but also i didnt get paperwork that day.

1,"   I wasn't aware off that I was late with my payment (have been a customer of comcast for a long time) until I was notified and last week my service was interrupted, I immidiately arranged a payment through my bank with bill pay and called Comcast, which started up my service again and it was good for a week until Tuesday when it happened again. I called and complaint and told them I made payment through my bank and this check from the bank was mailed in it would take 4-5 days, well needless to say nothing came to them yet and I made a payment over the phone just to get my service back and I told them over and over by phone, by email my payment has been sent to them from my bank via bill pay and they don't get it, I think they don't want to hear this at all. I also called them from my home phone when my service was disconnected and I could not get in, so I had to use my cell and it worked. They blocked my phone call from my home the day of the disconnection so I could not communicate with them at all. After my service was reinstated all of a sudden my home phone worked again to contact Comcast. How funny is that, not to me at all. I just received another email this morning from them payment needs to be made. WEll I told them I paid yesterday, I send a payment through my bank. I did not even receive a new billing statement yet for November. These people are just ignoring my concerns and do not want to hear what I have to say. In September our houshold and others around us had problems with the TV, black outs etc. it was even in the newspaper, well we did not get a credit for this, we had to pay the whole amount what was due for the months. Is there anything what can be done. We have not been late with bills before, we have been customers for at least 10 years. I want that Comcast listens to my complaints or my statement about my bill paying and not just ignoring me. The people on the phone I spoke too, where helpful but not the email people, they just ignore what I have to say. I know they deal with non paying customers all the time, but I am not a non paying customer. I am sitting between 2 chairs and trying the best I can."
1,I am really upset that I had had Comcast for over a year and they have constantly screwed up! My bills are wrong and no one can give me the right information! My service is crappy! Sometimes I can't order movies..I have to call in to get them to fix it on the computer. Our internet goes out all the time and we don't even have service for a day or two! They have lied about when the due date is... So that I can't get my deposit back b/c they say I am not paying on time! When I am!!! Costumer service won't always let you talk to a manager! They will keep you on hold for hours! I will be so glad to be done with them!!! Good ridence!
1,"Service in this area is under continuous maintenance and the outages are starting to occur almost daily. For a company with the monopoly on cable service in this town you'd think the governing business gurus would demand perfection or at least a competitor in. Oh well, guess it's back to Qwest -- at least they were reliable more than 75% of the time."
1,"   After some shopping aorund for a monthly TV service, I ordered Comcast Cable TV on October 20th, that is 20 days ago. When I ordered it I was told that it would all be set up the next day. When the installer came, he ran a cable into the house and informed me that the cable coming to my house from the underground box was damaged and they would have to run another. The work was promised to be completed within 3 to 5 business days later. They said they had to get a construction permit from the city to run another cable underground. I have been waiting since. I have had three installer show up at my door and bring me the converter box without me being informed and without any prior scheduling request or setu; they could not finish the work because they said an underground cable needs to be run. I was also called by five or six different individuals from Comcast telling me they are in charge of my ""case"" and they promise followup. I was told Comcast is still waiting for my city office to sign off on the permit they submitted weeks ago. I called my city office and found out that no permit has ever been submitted, my street is cabled for Comcast.  My city office also informed me that the permits for Comcast are usually signed off within a day or two. I keep calling Comcast three to four times a day and am not getting any callbacks or service.I have had three installer show up at my door and bring me the converter box without me being informed and without any prior scheduling request or setu; they could not finish the work because they said an underground cable needs to be run.

1,"3) Most importantly, their billing is conusing and I believe deliberately unclear- I was on a 12 month promotion for $99.00 per month for 12 months- from Aug 2008 untilAug 2009- despite the fact I never got the service until October 2008 (see above) I was still taken off the promo in August 2008- when o ur bill jumped almost $70.00 per month- WhenI contacted Comcast to end service in Sept 2009 they offered me 109 per month plus tax they said 118.51 per month - I agreed- I paid the higher August bill of 161. and change in Spet IN PERSON at their Manahawkin offcie and specifically asked the girl what date I was paid to- she informed me I was paid in full until Sept 9th, 2009- then my new rate of $118.51 should have been in effect- I paid $120.00 for Sept 9th until Oct 9th 2009- but Comcast says I am in arrears for $277. and change! There is no way since I specifically asked when I paid the bill- they break the cost down per service (phone, cable, internet) eventhouoght they sell it as a package making it impossible to understand or see what charges are- they sell you something then charge you for something else. I have twice requested a supervisor call my cell phone as above , but have not received any calls and the charges are still mounting. I want my damaged floor and wall repaired or money to do so, my missing 1/2 month credit and the CORRECT billing- I should only owe the 118.51 for October 9th until Novemebr 9th- Can you help? Can anyone help? How do I file a complaint? WhenI went to pay my last bill in Manahawkin other customers said they have experienced same problems but give up and they never get resolved or only get resolved after hours and hours of arguing- isn't there any federal or state agency that regulates this company!!!"
1,   I called customer service about my internet service and spent 26 minutes on hold before I gave up completely.
1,"   I was recently informed in a conversation wth a Comcast Representative that my internet modem rental fee was going to be increased from $3/mos to $5/mos.  This is a violation of the agreed 24 month contract that started in 07/2009 to 07/2011.  Comcast even admitted in an online chat with me that there was no standing for the fee increase.  Here is a partial section of the transcript.... Satya>Butch, show me where does it say on the contract that the MODEM CHARGES would be incresed within the 24 month contract period?  The contract was written by Comcast and no where do they stipulate that the charges is subject to increase.  YOU prove this to me!  I did not write the contract, Comcast did. Butch>The thing here is,it is not stated that there will be or should be an increase within the contract period for the modem but whether the rental is guaranteed not to be affected by any increase My contract stipulates that only ""After the 24 month Period, Comcast's then current applicable charges will apply."" This has resulted in increased fees in this tough economic time where all three members of our household are unemployed. There is a significant economic impact to this fee increase. Also this situation has taken an emotional toll because Comcast refuses to adhere to the agreed contract, and we feel powerless against such a big corporation. Please, I need your help in preventing this violation of agreed contract by Comcast Cable.Butch, show me where does it say on the contract that the MODEM CHARGES would be incresed within the 24 month contract period?

1,"   For two weeks, our home is having internet problems where we cannot get a connection or it is so slow you can leave, eat, come back and a simple page is just opening. I work from home and need internet access. Every time I call cable I get a different reason why that is happening, they schedule a tech to come. Each tech finds a different problem but they are never the one who can fix it so they say another team is going to be dispatched. When problem isn't fixed, another tech visits and says they don't see any changes were done but they claim it's a different problem. This circle keeps going. Customer service is of no help. There are no apologies or credits given for all the non working service we are receiving. I still have internet connection problems.  I work at home and can't do my job. I need to go to a Panera or McDonalds to do reports that need to be sent. I am loosing productivity. Very frustrated and increased blood pressure due to aggravation.

1,The Comcast idiot suggested I buy a better package.
1,"   I got overcharged on my Sept. 09 statement. I called customer service to rectify and this was rectified. During the conversation the rep offered me a triple play package which included internet, phone & tv with HBO and Stars for $129.99 a month for 1 full year. I accepted the offer and he told me he would switch me to a local rep to schedule the phone installation. We connected to this rep and introduced me to them and said goodbye. The next rep took a few moments and then said there was an issue and immediately switched me to a 3rd rep (Cathy). Cathy proceeded to tell me they can't make good on that offer and proceeded to try and get me to take another package. I replied that all the packages she was offering gave me less services and channels or would cost me more money then the offer I had already accepted. She then asked the original reps name as a method of discrediting my position. I repeatedly asked to speak to a supervisor and was refused over and over. Finally she relented and connected me to Michelle. Michelle/Supervisor proceeded to tell me that the only option was to accept less services or pay more money. She used the phrase ""I'm sorry you feel this package was misrepresented"". I mention this as I told her that her characterization of ""how I feel"" about this situation was not the issue and another tool to make me unsure of my position and that it wasn't a matter of how I feel, but a simple fact that I was offered a package which I accepted and then switched to another rep that reneged on the deal. Their argument was that they don't offer this package any longer and they have no other option then to give me less or charge me more. As far as I can tell, this is a classic bait and switch. These transactions are done on the phone. Comcast uses the vagueness of verbal communication to keep customers off balance, create doubt, discredit and re-characterize statements to their advantage.They ask you for the initial rep's name which leaves you unprepared as they only use first names and they can insinuate that we as customers don't understand or misconstrue what was said or have no proof. The only reason a customer would have to record names and ask for ID numbers is that they expect to have problems. If you don't have that name, then they reply, we can't verify what you are saying and the subsequent reps use that against the customer. When I asked for contact information to file a complaint, the supervisor was evasive and refused to do so until it was apparent that I was not going to accept any of the options she was offering. Essentially that I wouldn't accept an offer for less services or more $.   Cathy proceeded to tell me they can't make good on that offer and proceeded to try and get me to take another package.

1,"   I called to request a change to my account.  I was transferred between three CSRs over a total of 25 minutes because each one of them would tell me something, and then say their computer wasn't working.  The third CSR hung up on me."
1,"   I had Comcast Basic Cable for approximately twelve years and always paid my bills on time.In early 2009, I was not able to access the Internet on my home computer and after countless calls to MSN, my Internet provider at the time, was still not able to resolve the problem.  I assumed the cause of the problem was with the Internet provider, and, therefore, telephoned Comcast to inquire about their services.    They offered me Internet, telephone and cable service for a price of $70.00 for the year.    At that time, I told them I might be moving within the year and their representative told me to just disregard their one-year agreement form which they subsequently sent me by mail.   After signing up with Comcast, I discovered that I still wasn't able to get on the Internet, and their Technical Information Specialist told me to telephone their billing department to request that I not be charged for Internet services.   The bills I received from Comcast continued to show a charge for Internet service, and I faithfully paid all bills with the exception of the $21.00 a month for Internet service.     I moved to a new location not served by Comcast in mid-September 2009, and the bills continued to come.   I telephoned Comcast, and the representative told me to just disregard  the bills since my balance was zero.After returning from a ten-day trip in early October 2009, I received both a bill for $21.00 as well as a notice from a collection agency for the same amount.  As a result, I wrote a letter to the collection agency explaining the situation and also telephoned Comcast.   The representative at Comcast said that I did indeed still owe $21.00.  (I might add that the billing period was for October to November 2009, and my Comcast service ended on September 9, 2009.)"
1," When we got through to comcast, they stated that they could no longer honor the three year contact but said I could have that price for one year and then pay the regular price after that. That is not what my contact says though. Several hours lost time on the phone to comcast for my wife who is a cpa."
1,"   Comcast came to my house to install service. The guy saw a HD DVR box in my house and asked whats that. My wife told him that it was a box from another account and that we own it so it stays here(its my sons, who got charged for it after they sent his account to collections; he since then paid it off). Throughout the install which took like 2 hours he some how got his grubby little hands on the box and took it out to his truck (STOLE IT.) He never mentioned anything or gave a receipt for taking it and on top of that he didnt even do a good job because they had to send out another technician to fix it the next day. We called numerous time to customer service who just keep on saying he probably took it because he thought we were exchanging it or that we wanted to return it. That is not the case especially since we told him not to touch it in the first place. They just keep on giving me the runaround saying a field supervisor will come out. I have wasted 3 different days trying to wait for there supervisor. No luck. I am ready to just file a police report and have the police handle it but there is one big problem we have no paperwork on that box because my son is not very good at record keeping for himself. I asked comcast if they could just track it down by finding the technician who took it and see what boxes he brought back that day because there would be an extra one that is mine. His reply was that yes we can do that but you would need to provide a serial number and all this other crap. Which is really stupid since they could just connect the extra box with my address in there system easily. I guess I should have never trusted COMCAST to come into my home. I learned my lesson now.We called numerous time to customer service who just keep on saying he probably took it because he thought we were exchanging it or that we wanted to return it.

1,"   I transfered my Comcast account from Maryland down to Virginia when I moved into my new home. The mess began when the tech came out to install my internet and cable service. He told me the box where the cable connection was to be looked as if it got ran over by a lawnmower. He had to call other guys in to look at it and before too long I had three Comcast guys and their trucks on my block looking into it. After their discussions, the cable now runs from one side of my house to the other and then down the street to another box, much to the dismay of me and my neighbor who asked me why I didn't go with Fios (I had to have dry wall cut into my supposedly pre-wired for Fios new home) just to get my phone line with Verizon hooked up and that's a whole other story!). Now I wish I had because the cable was due to be buried yesterday but due to ""weather,"" the cable won't be buried until the middle of November. I was told by a CSR that because it had rained recently in my area that the cable couldn't be buried. OK, the damn thing has been out in the rain for three weeks but now because of the rain it can't be buried? I don't get it. The fun doesn't stop there. I lost my email connection because someone failed to tell me that when my old account would be closed it would disappear even with transferring my service from Maryland to Virginia. It took three phone calls and about an hour of hold time to finally get to somebody who could get my email working again and let me know in plain English that the work order to put my email address with my NEW account is in progress (until my email goes out again). Then the icing on the cake was when I got a bill stating that I hadn't paid the previous bill--basically the bill was printed two days before I sent my payment in for my bill. They can't wait to bill you for any new serivce you may add. Gotta get the moola. I'm debating about going with FiOS, but I really want to tell off some upper management guy that their customer service needs work, lots of it. I'm waiting to hear that the ground is frozen and they can't bury the cable yet again. Meanwhile the neighborhood looks like Kabul with a cable running down the street and then around my house.

I'm waiting to hear that the ground is frozen and they can't bury the cable yet again. Meanwhile the neighborhood looks like Kabul with a cable running down the street and then around my house. It took three phone calls and about an hour of hold time to finally get to somebody who could get my email working again and let me know in plain English that the work order to put my email address with my NEW account is in progress (until my email goes out again). Then the icing on the cake was when I got a bill stating that I hadn't paid the previous bill--basically the bill was printed two days before I sent my payment in for my bill.

1,"Everytime I call I get nothing but rotten excuses, disconnections because they can't even transfer the phone correctly and still, no credit back on our account and no working TV/Cableboxes.  "
1,"2/2009 - 181.75; 3/2009 - 96.23; 4/2009 - ; 5/2009 - 83.51. 6/2009 - 84.96; 7/2009 - 85.05  and then...8/2009 - 121.63; 9/2009 - 97.57; 10/2009 - 117.64 I called comcast, yet again. they will credit my account.  When asked what happened, Customer Service didn't understand the billing either.  I do believe this is NOT an honest error, I think this is Comcast being dishonest & hoping customers won't notice. Is there anyway for the Federal Government or some Regulatory Group to Audit Comast billing overcharges?  This is a whole other profit center for them. This cannot be legal.  What recourse is available to overcharged customers?"
1,   For many years I have been trying to get Comcast to arrange for the publication of my phone number.  They have repeatedly told me it's Verizon's problem.  This is NOT true.  Customer service response has been exceedingly frustrating. missed business opportunities
1,"   I have received 3 calls within the last 2-3 months soliciting for cable service.  Each time I tell them I am on the Do Not Call Registry and to take me off their list.  They always say they will, but the calls are still coming in. The call today was a robotcall. "
1,"There should be other providers that you can choose from besides Comcast.
I been scam by the company numerous times.  I have had my services changed without my permission. Several pay per view movies were ordered through Comcast employee using my idenity to make fake accounts. There was a time when my services were shutt off from Comcast employee getting the wrong address for disconnection on their part. I called that night and the representative told me my services would be back on in a hour but instead my phone and cable was turned off until the next day. 
The next month they charged my for this reconnection fee.  I called up was told by the representative that someone lived with me moved out of my apartment cancelled the services. Nobody is on my lease except for me!
I have explained to Comcast employee but nothing was done about the situation.  I have explained to them that you billed and disconnected the wrong person.
When I asked Comcast a refund for a mistake on their part for the disconnection of the wrong idenity they refused to refund my account!
Later,I was billed for reconnection fee on this Comcast employee mistake.
This goes beyond just a simple mistake this a huge idenity theft scandel.
Later, they turned around and made fake debt back in 2004 and demanded me to pay for this phantom debt or they would threaten me to disconnect my service.
There was nothing shown on my credit report going back 2004 of such debt.
I ask to validate it or I'm not going to pay.  To this day I haven't received anything in writing from Comcast of such debt.
I fould later that Comcast uses that as a tatics when they get caught in their lies.
There some shady crap about their billing process as well.They say you pay one month in advance but that is bull.  My bill is twice as much than what was quoted to me over the phone.  I know if your promotional rate is $39.99 for cable and $19.99 for phone my bill should not be $154 or $182.00 for that month.  They say my bill is high because of some pay per view movies and 411 calls.  That would mean I order over 10 movies in one month at $4.99 each  I could buy a few DVDs for that price or order Netflicks  and have the movies sent to my home.

1,"   I first signed up for their services on the month of august 2009.  The company installed they services on August 21st, which in ended up being one week later than expected.  Therefore, they provided me with a complimentary 3 month free of showtime due to the inconvenience caused.Then after that three weeks later i called to check on my balance of my account to make a payment and i was already in a past due balance.  I never received a bill from them because they had a wrong billing address in my account which they go from god nows where.  They fixed it but my question is how come if they had the wrong billing address how come i received the welcome to comcast letter in my right address which is the address where i reside. they have been overcharging my account and placing me on past due status due to this inconvenience.  I like their services and will like to continue with their services but i would also like to be compensated with what they offer in their agremment.  I feel betrayed and lyed to by comcast and i dont think is fair for customer to be fooled with offers that they wont fulfill at the end.

1,"         I opened my Comcast bill rec'd today, 10/19/09 date on bill. I saw the total amount owing of 635.38 for two months. I was shocked. There are 14 ***** movies charged on this bill. The dates are Sun 9/27, from 6:30am to 2:30 pm,Mon, 9/28 8pm to 10pm, Tues 9/29 6am, Wed, 9/30 12pm, Thurs, 10/4 6amto 1:49pm. I immediately called customer service, complaining that I did not order these movies. I am a single 45yr old mother with a 12 yr old son. I do not have a husband or a boyfriend and no other males in my household. My 12 yr old does not even know what *****s are. Many of the orders were during the week when I was at work (M-F 8-5) and my son was at school. I asked if there was any way somebody was getting into my cable from a remote location, they stated that is impossible. I asked because I live in an apt. complex, they stated the movies were ordered from my home, all of them off of my DVR in my living rm. I live in a 2 bdr apt and there is no way these would have been ordered in my presence. The charges on Sunday, 9/27 had to have been done in my presence and they were not. I watch football all day on Sundays,my son was not at home that day, he was at a friend's home. I told them this and that nobody was at home during the daytime hours that week and they insisted again that it came from my home. Of course, images of some pervert breaking into my home and ordering ******while we were gone came to mind, they stated again there was no other way any breach on their end happened. I have found information that there are illegal black boxes that are sold and all the criminals need to do is look up codes on a website and they can then get into someone's cable, including ordering pay per view. Comcast is not taking my complaint seriously, I am afraid now that someone is breaking into my home while we are not here because they refuse to acknowledge that it could be any sort of illegal activity. I heard a story from one rep at Comcast (my 2nd or 3rd call) that there was only one other similiar complaint he had personal knowledge of and that was when he states the husband admitted to ordering the **** movies. I insisted over and over again that there is no male in my household other than my 12 yr old son, I felt as if they were implying silently that perhaps my 12 yr old 7th grader was ordering the **** without my knowledge, in my small 2 bdr apt. There were also some charges on my 9/19 bill from 8/22, four movies. I did not pay attention to my 9/19 bill or I would have complained earlier. They stated there was no way they could remove the charges, insisting they were mine. They did tell me how to put a block on the pay per view, which I did. I asked to speak to a supervisor, they stated there was no supervisor present. I asked for a phone # to file a complaint, they stated there is no number for this but I can fax verification of where I and my son were during some of the charges (work and school) and I could also include a complaint with the faxed information and I could write to the ""executive"" customer care in Fife, Wa. So, I have to jump through all sorts of hoops to get them to investigate this. I have called the Sheriff today and left a vm for his assistant to contact me. I would appreciate an investigation to determine if I have a pervert in my home or if it is on Comcast.  I want these charges removed, I refuse to pay for someone else's filth. I would appreciate if Comcast would take this seriously and not imply that it was my 12 yr old son or that I am being dishonest. I know, through internet searches, that Comcast is aware of the illegal activity in regards to stolen cable and unauthorized charges, but they are not about to take any accountability for this, instead they make their faithful, long term customers feel as if they are at fault.   I would like Comcast to acknowledge to their customers that there are ways for other people to get access to your cable and order movies from pay per view without your knowledge or consent. I would like to see Comcast treat their customers with respect when they call in with a serous complaint such as mine and not be so jaded as to believe that all customers are lying when they call about something like this. Seriously, a little concern and empathy on their end would have gone a long way.  I want these charges removed, I refuse to pay for someone else's filth.

1,"    Failure of service with client. Did not follow thru order. Cut off cable anteena wire. SPEFICALY TOLD NOT TO TOUCH. Notified of instalation on a Tuesday had to call to see what happend as to why i was not installed. Was told cable company cut wire by mitake. Was told would repair on Wensday between 8 and 11 a.m. Was called at 8:15 a.m. could not respond called back at 10:30 responded was told appointment had been cancelled. Was trasferd to Mary who told me appointment could be set between 5 pm and 8 pm  TODAY. Called to confirm appointment was told NO appoinment was set up. Spoke with William, Supervisor who sated he would call back within 20 min. to say technician would be coming Today. HAVE NOT HEARD BACK!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"   Scheduled appt for 10/21, received two confirmation calls the night before.  No one ever showed up on the 21st, when I called they said the appt was cancelled incorrectly on their end with no call to me after I waited 3 hours.  I asked to be rescheduled for the next day.  I got a call on 10/22 at 7:38am telling me they would be there in a few minutes.  (my appt was guaranteed between 8-10am) By 9am I called comcast and they said they would check and call me back.  They never called back.  I called again and they still didn't know what was going on.  At 9:45am they called and said their technician wasn't around and they couldn't send anyone until a 12-4pm slot.  I have to go to work. After two days of this, I am more than disappointed and frustrated."
1,   I have been charged for 10 months for a broken DVR. I have been told 9 times that i would be called back or responded to by email. At no time was I ever called or emailed .... Not once. I have had 5 DVRs that ceased working after either months or hours. I have spent over 10 hours in total attempting to obtain from Comcast the service that I pay for. Disgusting.
1,"   Our televisions have been getting interrupted signals for over two months.  We have installed the comcast boxes to ensure we receive an uniterrupted/non-corrupted signal, but it has not worked.  Every 5 seconds or so the screen freezes on all tv's so it has ruined over two months worth of watching.  "
1,"   I called Comcast Cable Co. to get help with my phone.  During the course of the tech service call, I was called an idiot by one of the technicians at around 3PM PST onOct. 15.  He was impossibly rude during the entire call.   I want an apology and for this technician to be fired.  "
1,"   Comcast has the most confusing printed bills in the world for a reason. Money.After returning their boxes, turning off their internet and going to basic service they were still charging me for full service. I called them. I was told that Comast bills a month in advance but I would have these charges removed from my bill next month but I had to pay even though it was the wromg amount. So tell me how much my bill will be monthly. I was told $67.15. I asked repeatly how much will my monthly bill be after I paid this hugh bill. $67.15 per month. Okay I even took this guys employee number down ( which was made up)For 3 months I sent $67.15 per month. This is the amount Comcast told me to pay. Now they have cut my service off and turned me over to collections because my monthly payments are actually $87.50. Now all these short payments have piled into $300.00. I fought over an hour with a supervisor last night explaining again and again that I paid the amount Comcast said I owed. Over and over I asked him why he didn't pull the taped conversation I had when I was told to pay $67.15. He was sorry for the miscommunication but pay up or else be cut off. I'm on a fixed income. I made the original call to them to stop them from charging me for what I didnt have and to find out what my monthly bill was going to be after all my service cut backs. $67.15 is what they told me and thats what I've been paying. This is their fault not mine but they will not take responsibility. They want the money and thats it. "
1, I really hate to think that I must pay for a service I cannot use. Because it has become slow I'm having difficulties with my downloading. When it states I have no connection I feel as if I'm paying for a serice that is not up to par.
1,"   About a week ago I experienced some sort of network error that could not be repaired through comcast tool. I went without the internet for a week, and personally I feel I shouldn't have to pay for those days since it stated it was a Comcast issue. I'm sure [they] have hears other complaints since I know of three other people this has happened to recently. My money, and time have been wasted due to [their] errors."

We called a few days later to check up on the install time/Date and make sure everything was on track. We found out that Cable internet would not be available in our area and the modem order could not be canceled at that time. But were told to send the Modem back with the installer. Easy enough.
On the day of the install, My wife was home. The installer did a crap job and even cut out some of the maintenance loops left by our satellite installer. Complaining that our install was too complex he left a coax cable running the length of my living room. The installer took the modem(this becomes part of the issue) and lets us know that we should follow up with ComCast if we did not get a credit within 10 days.I get home and in about 10 minutes re-rout the wires to follow the old Satellite wiring path and was up and running. We instantly found fewer channels then we had before and an interface that seemed years behind what we had with our satellite provider.
After 10 days we started with the on line chat. After a few minute wait we explained our issue and gave the person both the account numbers and order numbers. He was unable to find our information and after several different attempts he finds the account and informs us he can not help us we need to call billing.
We did and after 20 minute in the Queue and another 15 minutes catching up the next person on the entire case we are told their system is down and we would need to call back.
We did and after 25 minutes in the Queue and another 10 minutes catching up the next person on the entire case we are told
to go back to the website. We ask to talk to a supervisor and being savvy we check the exact URL and find its the same one we tried before. We wait several minute just to have the person come back on the phone and tell us that the Call center supervisor would not be able to help us because the order was made on line. We demand to talk to a supervisor and after a few minutes he comes back tells us that we will be transferred and after about 5 more minutes the phone picks up. Then hangs up.
This time the chat person tells us that they are not able to help us either again and tries to send us to the 800- again. I decide to try the FCC and fill out there on line form. The run around is just too much and also go the Comcast.com and figure a quick e-mail to them will help too. I email 3 different groups. Rick, Customer service, and support. All say they give response in 24 hours. Ya.. That was a lie too.
After 24 hours we decide to try one last time.. We start with the chat being that we have been directed to both the chat and 800#. We are told after 25 minutes of chatting to call the 800# again. This time we let Derik know we are tired of the run around and inform him of our complaint to the FCC. We try to explain how we are asked to go call or talk to someone else each time, and that this is all over $109.90 that at this point no one even sees we have been charged for from Comcast. This despite the fact we can give them the order # and the account #.While in the chat we call the 800- number too. We find that our account is now ""locked"" and that only a supervisor can help us.. We still have not been contacted.

After 24 hours we decide to try one last time.. We start with the chat being that we have been directed to both the chat and 800#. We are told after 25 minutes of chatting to call the 800# again. This time we let Derik know we are tired of the run around and inform him of our complaint to the FCC. We try to explain how we are asked to go call or talk to someone else each time, and that this is all over $109.90 that at this point no one even sees we have been charged for from Comcast.

1," I pay over $300.00 per month between two homes for Comcast services. My only true issue has been with Comcast, Danbury, CT. Please call if you require any information I would be HAPPY to explain the 18 phone calls I have had to make to Comcast in less than one year - including the three times they have had to come to my home."
1,"   Payments were made to wrong acct, comcast refusing to refund to correct account, numerous calls made to comcast, spoke to numerous agents with no success. Ongoing situation since August 17,2009."
1,"   Over the past 6 months or more, I've noticed my ""On Demand"" highly-advertised feature of Comcast Digital Cable has basically gone offline between 2 or 3am and about 7am more than once a week. The past month has been especially bad when trying to rent films on ""On Demand"" and halfway through, several films cut out completely and a screen came up saying ""Unable to Process Request. Call 1-800-594-1234.""  As I've done at least half a dozen times, I called Comcast. The number provided says they're only available starting at 5am. So I called 1-800-Comcast and was put on a hold line that said the wait would be 15 minutes. I waited 20 and finally got ahold of someone. After a 38 minute conversation, I was told management had recently had a meeting 1.5 months ago about the late night On Demand issue. This is a minor part of my complaint. The customer service rep admitted that from 3am-7am for about a week to a week-and-a-half every single month in the Chicago market, On Demand goes down for maintenance. He offered a weeks worth of credit, but I quickly calculated that I'd have to call back in 7 weeks to get another bundle of credit for the downtime. He said this is fine, but offered no other solution. When I asked him if he personally thought this was unethical to require customers to call and ask for this credit when they advertise a flawless product, he simply told me about their meeting and that as a late night worker, this is all he deals with. I do not blame him for anything, in fact he was polite and informative.  I do blame Comcast for charging exorbitant prices for a product that is simply not what they advertise to the general public... especially to people who don't have the patience or ability to call and inquire why their ""On Demand"" doesn't work at certain hours for an entire week or more. How many people are they ripping off if there's more than a total day (28 hours by my calculations and by admission of their customer service rep) of On Demand per month unavailable to their customers? Every 7 weeks I have to call them up for a credit of the On Demand not available to me nor anyone in Chicago.

1,"   This is minor compared with the horror stories I've been reading, still ...Last month I lost service  for 4-5 days when a comcast technician erroneously disconnected my cable by accident in the process of installing cable for one of my neighbors.  It didn't take me that long to figure out I didn't have cable, but I wasn't able to get a technician for 4 days.Then on my next bill, I get a charge of $27.99.  They charged me to fix THEIR mistake.  Sheesh.I complained to a very polite customer service person, who was very apologetic but unable to help me.  She kept referring me to their little insurance policy where you pay a monthly fee so you don't have to pay when the technician comes by.  Yeah, that's nice, but I shouldn't have to pay for THEIR screwup.Then on my next bill, I get a charge of $27.99.  They charged me to fix THEIR mistake.

1,"   I typed 132,78 in the online bill payment amount instead of 132.78 and Comcast tried to take 13,278.00 out of my checking account.  I called immediately after I realized my error but Comcast would not cancel the payment.  They admitted the have no edits or checks on the amount field and they do not provide a confirmation/cancelation option screen like most other merchants.  They offered a refund if they could determine it was really an error but it would take at least 7 business days. Cleaning out my checking account will cause all my other bill to bounce. Meanwhile Comcast enjoys an interest free loan of 13k."
1,"   I don't know what the deal with Comcast is but I hope they are not trying to target and scam elderly people.  
My dad got the computer from my brother who works as a tech support personnel in a computer based business.  My brother had used the computer before he had given it to my dad.  My brother knew it was internet ready.  My brother took the tower and brought it to his home because he already has internet, a much faster speed than what my father was ordering, and wanted to see if it would work there.  Sure enough it did, even with the faster connection.My brother called Comcast and what is really sad about the whole situation is that the Comcast representative didn't appeared surprised that this had happened.  My brother got the impression that the Comcast representative had heard this before and that Comcast wasn't doing anything about it.  Instead, it appears they are allowing these technicians to take advantage of the elderly, non-computer illerate people, etc.  Shame on them.

1,"I am writing to dispute the Collection Notice I received in connection with ComCast.  For my entire adult life I have worked very hard to maintain good credit; I have NEVER been sent to collections and should not have been sent to collections this time.   I am deeply troubled about this error and the ramifications I will experience on my credit reports.   I am hoping that you will resolve the error so that I may go on with my life with the good credit which I worked so hard to maintain.The history of my interactions with ComCast are as follows:July 21, 2009: I called ComCast to cancel my service.  At that time I was told that the last day of my current service was July 30, 2009, and that I would be receiving an adjustment, a final billing statement, and a check for $6.00.August 11, 2009: I received a Disconnection Notice from ComCast stating that I owed $21.65. I called ComCast and spoke with Matt.    I didn't understand why I was receiving a Disconnection Notice because I had already cancelled my account and was expecting a credit.  Matt told me to disregard the Disconnection Notice and that I would be receiving a credit in the amount of $34.76 in 4-6 weeks.September 29, 2009: I received the Collection Notice from Credit Protection Assoc. I called ComCast immediately to straighten things out.
1)	First I was told that it is true, my records show a voluntary disconnect and I should not have a bill.  The agent said not to worry, he took care of everything and would send the verification to my house.   Then he disconnected me.
2)	I called again and I was sent to Houston and was told they could not access my records.
3)	I called again and waited 5 minutes and the agent told me she was hearing another call and couldn't hear me, then I was disconnected.4)	I called again and spoke to Fernando and was told that the system wasn't working properly.  He said I owed the $21.65.  I asked him to check the call log for 8/11/09.  He checked the 8/11/09 call log and indeed it showed that I was told I had a credit, although the amount was not logged.  He said he couldn't do anything because the system wasn't working.I have no problem paying a $21.65 bill and I certainly would not be foolish enough to jeopardize my credit score over this amount.   I am contesting the Collection Notice from Credit Protection Association based on what ComCast told me not once, but THREE times.  I am enclosing my notes.   All agents I have spoken have found my cancellation call in their logs and Fernando found the call on 8/11  in which I was told I had a credit balance.I will be making the payment tonight to expedite the process of clearing up this matter.  What I am most concerned about is the damage to my credit.   4)	I called again and spoke to Fernando and was told that the system wasn't working properly.  He said I owed the $21.65.

1,"   My complaint is about services provided by Comcast Cable Services in Albuquerque New Mexico.  I recently acquired Comcast Cable and Internet Services for my Apartment Home.  By doing this it has led to Inconsistent services such as my TV reception, on-demand services and internet service to be inadequate.  I paid for these services to work when I called to have it installed over three weeks ago.  Angela who is a Sales person came out and installed cable wiring in a not so professional way.  Angela broke some sheet rock from a small corner on the bottom part of the wall.  The next day I switched out my cable box for the fix.  To this day Sep 24th 2009 I still do not have On-Demand working, and my internet is jumping from 468 kps to 1100 kps.  I took my cable modem in to have it changed today and a splitter.  They are installed and im still having a problem.  All this after having five techs come out to my apartment.  One of the Techs came out to my apartment and reported back that he was never here, the system says CANCELED.  I have been told by Mindy that i am not paying for on-demand it is part of my cable service and they give it to us free.  I pay for this as part of a package and it is important.  I pay for these services and wish to have them work or comcast should let me know this is the best they can do.  Then I can cancel!  Supervisors are not calling me back I called Executive Offices at: 1-215-665-1700 and spoke with an executive assistant.  Still no fix as of yet.  A customer should not be treated this way.  I have had cable 3 weeks and 5 techs came out, i am waiting for another.  This is ridiculous!  Can someone help to insure businesses do not step on the little guys.  What ever happened to quality service WORK and trust of companies."
1,"I have 2 TWO accounts in my name...one in Boulder (NEW) and one in Golden (OLD).  I would like the Boulder account to also be set up for autobill to my credit card but it doesn't even appear on comcast.com under my account. BTW, I called and spent 20 min on the phone with Comcast this morning only to be redirected here--to a dead end. All I want to do is CONSOLIDATE both bills to be billed to a credit card each month so I don't have to write a check.  I can't access the Boulder(NEW) account to do that because I can't even see it on website. only see ""Change account name"" under Account Summary. There is no option to add an account My Golden account is set up to automatically BILL TO A CREDIT CARD.  I want my Boulder account to do the same. If I were able to access my Boulder account, I wouldn't be wasting my life talking to [them].  NO--I can't access my Boulder account. Why is this so difficult to understand? If the account isn't there to begin with, what good will it be to reset my password? Why can't [they] list both accounts under my ONE name? I gave up.  Like talking to a turnip. SOME CEO at COMCAST needs to be accountable and make himself visible instead of playing the ""Man Hiding Behind the Curtain"" as in the Wizard of Oz. No where on Comcast's website is there a way to escalate complaints to a regional manager or VP, etc.  Oh, and when I set up the order to install new service, they didn't do it right and they had to come back a second time, which resulted in more missed time (for me) from work to meet their window/timeframe of when they could be available. Customer service is a joke in this company! They prefer to keep their heads in the sand and their hands in customers' pockets.

1," Comcast is the only provider in our area, so they can take advantage of their customers however they feel and do."
1,"Paying Comcast Triple Play odes not really make sense, sionce you cannot get good service"
1,"    In April of 2009 I purchased a new home.  We previously had service with Verizon FIOS and were told that we could not get Verizon at our new address and that the provider was Comcast. We ordered telephone and internet service with Comcast.  The service was installed and for a period life was good.  Suddenly we began having problems with our service.  Our service worked intermittently.  We contacted Comcast.  An appointment was set up for 10 am - 2 pm. My wife and I spent the whole day waiting for the tech and at approximately 2:15 called Comcast.  I explained that we had waited all day for a service tech and no one had shown.  I was put on hold and told that someone would call me back within 10 - 15 minutes and guess what: no one called me back. I called back about an hour later and told the customer service agent (CSA) that the service tech never came and that I had called and was promised a return call which I never received.  I was put on hold and the CSA came back and asked me what color door I had.  I said it was blue (as is my neighbors) and she said that the tech had knocked on a blue door and got no answer.  I told her that this was not possible and that both my wife and I were home all day.  I also asked if it was procedure to call a customer if there was no answer or if they left a note and she said that this was the procedure.  I told her that I had not received a call or a door tag and she just said she couldn't comment on that.  I asked for a supervisor and was told that none was available and that one would call me back within 30 minutes. I never received a return call from a supervisor.   Finally another appointment was made.  Before the appointment was to occur I received an automated message that my problem had been fixed and my appointment was cancelled.  Surprise, surprise - the problem still wasn't fixed.  I called back Comcast on THREE (1, 2, 3) occassions and they assured me that the appointment was still on.  I waited all day and of course - no Comcast tech showed up.  I could go on and on but .... I finally switched to Verizon on July 24.  It is ironic that I was told by a neighbor that apparently on the day that I switched service providers Comcast found that a node was out.  I was also told that many of my neighbors also had service problems with Comcast. Up to this point I had spent numerous hours on the phone with Comcast, had been made many promises which they failed to fulfill and had spent days waiting for a tech to show up. Immediately after I cancelled my service I turned in my modem at the Comcast service center and got a receipt for it.  I was told that it would take 4 - 6 weeks to receive my refund.  And after 4 - 6 weeks did I receive a refund?  NO! I called Comcast and was told that they had no recipt of my equipment return.  I told the CSA that I had a receipt for the return.  He told me that ""Comcast would have to check their inventory to locate the equipment"".  I told him that as far as I was concerned that was not my problem.  I had a recipt (which I faxed to them) and that what they did with the equipment after I returned it was not my problem.  He assured me that this was the way it would be.  Once they located the equipment I would receive my refund. So I called the Office of the Comcast President, B. Roberts, at 215- and spoke with F. Lively.  She assured me that the actions of the CSA were not correct and that the issue would be resolved immediately and that I would receive a return call that same day.  Did I?  OF COURSE NOT! I feel that Comcast should be held responsible for the loss of time and mental anguish that customers experience at the hands of Comcast.  I encourage anyone that is considering Comcast to search the internet for complaints against Comcast.  They are loaded with disgruntled Comcast customers.  This doesn't surprise me at all.  What does surprise me is that there are several posts from Comcast employees and past employees that condemn the actions of Comcast. I certainly hope that some bright young attorney will consider a class action suit against Comcast for damages suffered by their Customers, past and present, for their actions which have damaged their customers.  Ultimately I hope that Comcast will conduct their business with respect for their customers and their lives. I also asked if it was procedure to call a customer if there was no answer or if they left a note and she said that this was the procedure.  I told her that I had not received a call or a door tag and she just said she couldn't comment on that.  I asked for a supervisor and was told that none was available and that one would call me back within 30 minutes. I never received a return call from a supervisor.

1,"   Learned 07/28/09 from Experian that Comcast placed a delinquent account on my credit report from 2006. I have not had any accounts with Comcast since 12/2001. Advised by Comcast Operator, Kelly on 07/30/09 that the account was closed in 2001 and left in good standing with a credit balance. I have called Comcast six times since 07/30/09 and continue to receive the same info. On 08/26/09, I was advised by Comcast Operator, Tory, that Comcast sent a letter to the Collection Agency dated 08/26/09 reporting the error and to update the matter immediately. I requested a copy of the letter, yet never received. I have requested someone from the Finance Dept. to contact me at least six different times and never received a return call. On 09/21/09, I contacted the Collection Agency. They indicated the matter is still in collections and they have never received a letter from Comcast.  09/21/09 contacted Comcast again and spoke to Operator Jeff to advice him of this info. He stated that the letter of 08/26/09 was sent and the matter was closed. I indicated that it had not been handled, collection agency never received letter and this is still in collections and on my credit report. He opened a new matter in their computer system indicating this information but continue that he could not give me any contact info. and would yet again request someone from the Finance Dept. to contact me.  I have contacted the City of Alexandria Government Office as well as the Attorney General's office, but have received no resolution, no letter, no return phone calls from anyone.  Negatively impacted my credit rating which caused great problems financially upon refinancing my home. Spent hours on the phone and computer trying to resolve the issue directly with Comcast of Alexandria, the Collection Agency and Experian and it continues to be an ongoing battle with zero information and zero resolution. I am a single mother of two small children and have been on hold for two months while trying to get a home equity loan and cannot do so until this matter with Comcast is resolved and I receive this information in writing.

1,"   As a long term user of COMCAST's extended basic analog service, I listened in 2008 when COMCAST advertised that there would be ""NO IMPACT"" to their subscribers when the analog to digital change occurred in 2009.  When the change occured, I incurred a significant amount of time, energy and frustration to receive less service than I had before. I am now forced to have COMCAST Equipment in my home and pay for service that was free before. I experienced a number of days of incomplete service when the digital system was not equivalent to the earlier analog.  I was charged for a service call by COMCAST to install an amplifier because the digital signal was NOT as strong as the earlier analog signal.  Complaints submitted to COMCAST web were not responded.  So I formally complain of COMCAST false and misleading advertising in 2008.

1,"   Technician #5052 came out on Tuesday 15th September, 2009 to remove cable boxes.  We were downgrading to basic cable and did not need it.  He left with the boxes and did not remove cables from 32' inch Vizio tv. Tried to turn on TV and nothing happened. Just a blue screen. When he was leaving, he did not even give me the work order sheet to sign! Very sloppy work! Called Comcast and they sent someone else out on September 19th, who said that he could do nothing.  He diagnosed it as having the 'blue screen of death.' It is a two year old TV!  Comcast is giving me a run around to have it repaired... they have to send someone out from THEIR office to verify that the tech is responsible for the damage.  I requested an independent contractor so that the findings would be un-biased.  This was denied.  They then informed me that it would take at least two weeks before i would be contacted by this person and then even longer before they would come out to look at the TV.  So my family has to do without television for that length of time while they string us along! This is not acceptable! "
1,"   in reviewing my comcast bill i noticed alot of hidden charges in addition to excessive billing cycle.which should be every 30 days instead of every 15 days. starting date of june 18.2009.also i can not veiw my bill online when checking causeing me to become late with payments ,so it shouldn be noted that this is very unprofessional and something should be done to better service to all paying consumers.in concluion i would like to have my bill looked over for possible slamming."
1,"What a mistake they were nothing like I thought for a internet provider. We always had service interruptions and slow speeds. Come to find out they had to take a trap off our line to be close to the speed that we were supposed to get and after a month they tried to charge us for more TV channels. The funny thing is we do not have any TVs in the house so finally after 3 months they removed the price difference but never gave is credit for it. Also if you do not pay them right away they turn you in to a credit service and trash your credit even if it was their mistake about the billing, I know this because it happened to me 7 times and even tho they issue was taken care of and yes a 7 times were errors on there side my credit is still tarnished from this to this day. Oh and by the way it was not like we were out in the sticks, we were located less than 6 miles from the main Comcast building.After 5 months those smart asses came back out and put the trap back on the line and did not tell us and flat out denied it when I asked them but I could see the trap on the cable up on the pole. After I told them that they were full of it they fessed up after about an hour. I was out of service for the total of 41 days in a 1 year time and many service glitches. It never would surprise me when I came home from work and found out that I had no internet. Finally in April 2008 we were pleased to find out that AT&T Uverse was available with high speed internet in my area.We called them and it was hooked up in less than 5 business days and running. Since then we only had 2outages and they lasted no longer that a few minutes and the speeds are much faster than Comcast ever was. Customer support is really good threw AT&T also. Biggest thing is about Comcast is they will keep changing and raising your bill and you never know month to month of what it will be.About a month ago we had new families move in to the neighborhood and I told them the horror stories about Comcast.

1,"   Comcast was initially supposed to set up service in my home on 9/5/09 but due to the line in need of repair, they told me they needed to come at a later date. They scheduled me for 9/11/09 from 2p-5p for repair & installation of services (cable, phone, & internet). Friday morning, I returned home around 11:30a to find that one of the Comcast subcontracted techs had left a voicemail to notify me that he was going to be late. I was not aware that anyone was supposed to come out before my scheduled 2p-5p appointment. Another rep. from Comcast called, about 30 min. after the tech., to inform me that the tech was going to be late & that there was no ETA. I called Comcast to find out what was going on & was informed that a pre-wiring was scheduled for 8a-11a. No one had notified me before & that a pre-wiring needed to be done nor that an appointment from 8a-11a had been scheduled. It would not have mattered anyway, however, because the tech was late anyway; almost 2 hours late! The employee from Comcast, Cody, came as scheduled at 2p to proceed with the installation of services, but informed me that the pre-wiring had not been done & that he could not proceed without it. He called his supervisor & the supervisor of the subcontracted techs. He installed a temporary pre-wire (which meant running a wire through my sliding glass door with it being cracked open, leaving my home unsecure). He installed it this way with the underst&ing that another pre-wiring tech would come out by 5:30p the same day to fix the wire & install it correctly as per Natanya in the Richmond Comcast office. I paid $183.95 installation fee as per Comcast policy under the good faith that the services would be complete that day. Well, I waited until 5:30p & no tech had come. I called Comcast &, of course, the local office was closed so I spoke with several people in different call centers who could not get in contact with Comcast dispatch. They sent several emails to Richmond concerning the situation but I did not hear from anyone, a supervisor, until almost 10p. He informed me that he had just received the email as he had been in the field all day. I told him I appreciated him calling me back but was thoroughly disgusted with the type of service I received & that I did not wish to have services with them anymore. He stated that he would check to see why the tech never came to do the pre-wiring & get back with me.  I would like to know why no one ever came to complete the services & why did they ask me to pay money for services they knew were not going to completed that day. I have yet to recieve an answer from the Richmond office as they are closed on the weekends apparently. Their subcontractors are goign to cause them to lose money & customers. They need to rescind the contract with that company & hire a company who is going to do the job they are paid to do.

1,   1st of all my cable started out being $129.00 a month then it jumped to $227 a month. I requested several times for a technichion to come out & when he did come it was two hours later. My dvr & two cable boxws hasn't work for over six months. Thats ridiculious how much the bill is every month & they would'nt compisate us for our cable not working & not telling us that the cable services went up extremely high! & our computer iternet is very slow....
1,   I Called Comcast Cable about The cable boxes they installed.The boxes over heat.They told me I still oh them $24.84.And the only way They would Replace The Boxes is to pay.My Cable had bend out for two weeks.They only credit me for one week.and said I oh them $24.84.I told them my service was not working properly.They Said they would send someone out to look at the boxes.And If no one answer the phone on that day the worker will leave.I stayed home all that day and no one ever showed up or called.My service is still not working right and I payed the monthly bill.I called comcast and got no answer.
1,"   I have documented each and every call have made to Comcast in chronological order, I also attempted to have the Customer Representative name and id's documented but on number of occasions rep refused to disclose their identification number. 10/3/08 I called to upgrade cable box and to add cable modem. Customer Representative: scheduled a appointment for tech to come on Saturday 10/4/08 to check and install cable modem, also rep stated if I like I can have the cable box shipped and that will ensure I have a good box, so I stated that would be fine. 10/4/08 Tech came out removed old cable box and setup the cable with TV, until I get a new HD cable box and tech fixed and installed new cable wire from the main cable box and he also installed a new cable wire to TV. 10/6/08 Called customer service due to having problems with cable modem, tech was scheduled to come out on 10/7/08 to check the signal to cable modem, problem was fixed when tech came on 10/7/08. 10/7/08 Received new cable box and I called to activate the box, but during activation ran into problem so Customer Representative Schedule for tech to come out to fix the box because cable boxes codes were not getting updated when customer rep attempted. When tech came out to the house he stated box had no problem, problem was with account setup at Comcast end, since this was a bulk account codes must be wrong in the account so I must called customer service to have the bulk codes corrected, I stated ok, and tech stated he will inform his supervisor. 10/8/08 Called customer service and spoke to G. Leahong, rep didn't provide his id number. Rep stated I need to go to customer service center along with letter from manager's office. 10/11/08 I went to customer service center in Audubon, I was told they can't help, I must call customer service center. 10/15/08 Called customer spoke to customer rep Cory, id number: 110485, he stated I need to call business service center at 609-289-8035, when I called on numerous time, I got a voice mail. Then I called customer service again and explained the situation, I was told that customer rep will send an email to bulk account supervisor and to have someone call me on 10/30/08. After this I received a call from Comcast quality assurance dept from E. Gaddy, ID#: 421, he asked if the problem is solved I explained everything he stated he will call the bulk account dept and have someone call me from their but if no one calls to call him back, I asked if he can give the phone number where he was able to reach staff from bulk account he stated he could not because he was calling bulk account dept from special assistance line. 10/31/08 Called quality assurance dept I was told E. Gaddy is busy but he will call me on my cell, also I explained that no one from bulk account dept called on 10/30/08. Called, spoke to Rep: L. Abraham, I was told to call back after getting home since rep won't know if cable box is updated with new codes. Called again at 5:30pm spoke to  rep: Roger who without informing me stated if I can wait I stated ok then next voice I heard was of rep Ashley, ID#: 39A, she again stated the tech has to come out and check the cable box even though I told her that problem is with codes in the system not with cable box, she stated still that problem is with the box, she scheduled for tech to come out on 11/3/08 between 2-4pm, but if channel s come up to call back and cancel the appointments. 11/3/08 Tech was no show. 11/13/08 Spoke to customer rep: Karen, ID#:7Z8, she was again telling me the same old thing problem is with box, then I asked her to transfer me supervisor, I then spoke to supervisor J. Klick, who again spoke about the problem with cable box and she also schedule an appointment for tech to come to the house to check the cable box on 11/15/08 between 10-12pm. 11/15/08 Called 800-316-1619 at 11:55am, tech was no show, spoke to rep: Stan ID#: 18862. Explained everything AGAIN, he stated no service call was setup he again stated problem is related to codes in the account relating to bulk accounts, he was asked to transfer me to supervisor who refused to disclose his name but managed to schedule another service call for 11/18/08 between 2-6pm. 11/18/08 Tech came and checked the cable box and stated he is unable to fix the problem because problem is related to codes in the account setup, only very a few staff members are allowed to do that.  After he left cable box started to display a message box is unauthorized and to call Comcast. After the tech left I called customer service and spoke to Customer rep: Tony ID#: 119609He got his supervisor (Jay, ID#: 9AA), who started to say that I need to call bulk account dept, I explained the whole situation to him then he stated he will call them which he did and problem was fixed. To make sure I will not have the same problem once I get 3 more HD boxes, I asked Jay, he clearly stated I just need to get 3 more boxes and hook them up and I should not have any problems. I THANKED him for his whole heartedly for his assistances. 12/5/08 I went to Audubon customer service center and got 3 more HD cable boxes, came home and installed them, but while checking make sure all channel are coming I noticed that on one box I was missing all Premium channels, on another box missing encore on demand, N channel, Travel Channel, and then on the third box missing some channel as well. 12/11/08 Called customer service and explained the whole thing again.  I spoke to customer rep: Victor ID#: 2064, He then transferred me to bulk account rep Tonette, ID#: 118785, who stated I should not be getting any Premium channels, then I asked to talk to her supervisor Michael, ID#: 118389, who reassured me that the problem will be fixed and he will have a bulk account rep call me on my cell phone on 12/12/08 in the evening.  Now Tonette stated she is from bulk account dept, so why her supervisor stated he will have the bulk account representative call me? 12/15/08 No one ever called from bulk account dept. I called the customer service AGAIN spoke to Jeff, ID#: Y03, he stated that I should be not be getting  any Premium channels  or any sports channels or encore on demand, I protested by explaining that is NOT true until 12/11/08 I has getting all the channels on one of my TV, but once I added additional boxes, I am missing channels and since I called last week my one box is now missing most of channels it was getting prior to 12/11 or 12/12/08. If that was the case then why after 11/18 if started receiving channels that I was getting prior to 10/3/08,  then I asked to speak to Jeff's supervisor, he put me on a hold for 12 minutes then a female voice came on the phone, and   identified herself as a team leader, I asked why was I transferred to team leader when I had requested to speak to supervisor and stated her name is KIANNA, ID#: U0F, stated the same thing I should not be getting any Premium channels and I stated then WHY everything was fixed on 11/18/08, and if it is a matter of documentations then it is Comcast internal issue because one of rep did not documents the initial setting up of the account, more over prior to 10/3/08 I was getting all the channels on the cable box, then why on 11/18 a supervisor was able to assist me and fix the issue.... Since being treated so unprofessionally, I lost couple more channel and I am sure she has documented interaction from only her side and I truly wish I can have this matter resolved as soon as possible without dealing with any other customer rep as unprofessional a s KIANNA, ID#: U0F.  Also, I would like for Ms. Kianna to receive more training in customer relations as well as learning how to listen to customers before responding to their issue whether they be minor or major. 12/18/08 Tech came out to check the cable box but AGAIN he stated the problem is with the code at Comcast end not with cable boxes in the home. Intaller Job#: 429 9/5/09 I found out that comcast has been charging me for hd service, while never taking time to notify me.I happend to find that out becasue I was activating my new cable boxes. Best of all rep stated that HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT, then he just dropped my call. If any of you are wondering, I have yet to receive any call from comcast about resovling this issue. For past year comcast have been charging me $6.00/month. you can do the math.He got his supervisor (Jay, ID#: 9AA), who started to say that I need to call bulk account dept, I explained the whole situation to him then he stated he will call them which he did and problem was fixed.

1,"One of the 3 cable boxes quit working on 8/29/09. I decided to stop the service on that box. I returned the box to Comcast on 10th St., waiting in line for 45 minutes. I also wanted to downgrade my plan to delete premium channels. The representative said I had a plan and I couldn't do that now. I have had Comcast since 7/2007. Now, the 2nd Comcast cable box is not working and they cannot come out until Monday at 1-3pm and won't adjust my bill until after the correction. I do not recommend Comcast and will change service if the service is not corrected before Monday."
1,"All my higher channels (35 and up) disappeared for a couple of days, so I called Comcast yesterday, September 2, 20009, to report the problem thinking that maybe there was a malfunction and I was being a good Samaritan. But nope, to my very unpleasant surprise I learned that Comcast finally made their way to my area switching to digital, which I thought meant, unless I was on an antenna, there’ll be no problems or need for a converter or digital box. I definitely wasn’t aware that half the channels I’ve been receiving would suddenly disappear unless I purchase an upgrade for $50.00 per month. That’s a $33.71 increase - 3 times more - in order to continue to get exactly what I’ve been getting for $16.29!So, to my further surprise, the Comcast rep told me that I’ve been getting these higher channels for free. Ha! That’s odd because $16.29 is not free and this so-called $50.00 upgrade package to keep what I’ve been paying for is unbelievable! How do these guys friggin get away with this crap? How is this sort of thing not against the law? Quite simply put, I can’t afford any more than what I’ve been paying. I don’t want to lose half the channels I’ve received all these years and I don’t want be gouged by Comcast any more than I have already. "
1,"I switched to a package deal with Comcast in February of 2009. Beginning April 27, 2008, we began to have major problems: no cable TV on the third floor, no phone service for 14 days, internet will not work unless you use the ethernet and skip the modem. One serviceman cut the 2nd phone line and said that would fix the problem. After two days, we called again. This serviceman brought a new modem. The 3rd service man said it was an underground problem and stated he would call for service to go underground. No response. The 4th said we have a wiring problem. The 5th said we need another router but it would cost us $50 to have someone come out to hook-up the router. Today, I talked to Marlene. She said no September service was available. They charged us full price for internet, cable and phone."
1,"I had Comcast cable/phone/internet installed on July 13, 2009 and I am ready to cancel them. Every afternoon the service goes out and my phone is dead. What is going on? I am out of work. However, I do typing and depend on a working internet provider. Comcast just tells me it will be up shortly (after I use my cell phone minutes). I need a dependable service. Comcast sure wants their dependable $182 monthly charge!"
1,"Since 2006, one of the charges on my Comcast bill was HDTV Digital Converter for $39. Starting in July 2009, Comcast changed the description of this charge. It now reads ""HDTV Digital Converter 6 @ $6.50 each for $39. It suddenly became obvious to me that I had been paying for 5 extra HDTV digital converter boxes (I have only one HDTV digital converter box in my house). Comcast had overcharged me a total of $1,050 over three years. Eight different Comcast customer service representatives verified that it was a billing error, and eight different customer service representatives told me that I should have been checking my bill more closely. One customer service representative told me that he would do me a favor by crediting my account $195 since Comcast is only required to refund up to 3 months of erroneous charges. I think I deserve a full refund. Comcast's previous billing methods were deceitful and misleading. If I was being charged for more than one converter, the charge should have been listed as converters not converter. The customer service representatives told me that I should have known that $39 was excessively high for one HDTV converter box; however, since I purchased the HDTV converter box within a plan/bundle, I did not know the specific breakdown of charges. I am also used to Comcast's high prices, so I did not think twice about the $39 charge per box. Honestly, that is how I was thinking. By the way, I still cannot find a price list anywhere on Comcast's website that lists $6.50/converter box."
1,"They came out to install the Triple Play on Friday, August 21st. I already had cable. Since that date, I have had nine separate techs at my house over the course of a week. Last Thursday, the tech left saying it wasn't the correct signal yet but he'd be back. I've never heard from him since and neither he nor the other Tech who actually worked for Comcast (vs. a contractor) and gave me their cellphone numbers will return my calls. I still don't have working internet and we are on Day 11."
1,"I signed up for Comcast back in July 2007 for a basic cable package. I was excited because I had all the channels I wanted. Then, shortly after I received them, they cut half of my channels out without informing they were changing over to digital. I had to pay the same price for the channels I was now not receiving. Then, I left to go out of the country so I discontinued my service. I came home and asked Comcast if we can reconnect my cable service. I asked them if I will receive CNN and Fox News with the basic cable service and they told me oh yeah you will receive even more channels, so I am like great sign me up! The Comcast service rep told me I have to be home between 12:00pm and 4:00pm because that is when the guy is going to hook up my service. So I waited and I waited and I waited. Finally, I called Comcast where is the guy who is to come hook up my cable? She told me there was no connection with my account. I am like what! I told her I called the week before and asked for them to hook up my cable, and they told I had to be home between the hours of 12:00pm and 4:00pm. She told me I do not need to be home when they hook up my cable and that she would try and get someone out to hook up my cable. They hooked up my cable finally, and I got all the channels I wanted like they said. I left the next day to go out of town for a week and a half. I came home and half of my cable channels are gone! I am like ugh! I called Comcast and asked them what the heck is going on. They told me oh with basic cable you only get 32 channels. I hit the roof going what! I told them that I talked to the customer service person and they told me I would get these certain channels with basic cable. The service person said no, you do not get those channels. I said I want my service shut off. I no longer want to deal with your service. They told me I still have to pay $37.29. I was like what? I was not the one who made the mistake here. I then called customer service again this morning to talk to a supervisor. I shared with the supervisor the complaint I had with Comcast that I shared with the other customer service person and felt I should not have to pay for their mistakes. The supervisor told me, oh that Comcast messed up and gave people several people more channels than they should have not gotten now, as if that was going to make me feel better. I told him they need to honor their customers because they are the one who made the mistake not us and that we should not have to pay for their mistakes. He told me I still have to pay the $37.29. He told me I can file a complaint with Comcast if I wanted to. Like that they were really going to do anything about it. I did not think asking not to pay the bill was a big asking price for all I have gone through with Comcast. Help.Well I, along with others, am paying for their mistakes. I had put my time into trying to get them to remove the charges because of their mistakes. I paid the same amount of money for channels I did not get back in 2007-2008. Money is lost here and time."
1,"Our cable service through Comcast was not working. We were not receiving the channels that we had paid for. I called to arrange a service technician to come and fix the problem. The appointment was for 8/30, between 10-12. No one showed up and no one called. I called customer service and the representative said she did not know why there was no one here. She said she'd contact the service center and they would call me with an update within 15-30 minutes. They did not call. I called customer service again and again, I was promised a 15-30 minute response time. Again, no one called. Finally, a technician showed up at 1:45."

1,"Comcast came to my home to add the internet on August 13, 2009. The technician arrived and went to the office in which I was having it connected. He drilled through the wall and hit a wire. As a result of this, I lost electricity in two of my bedrooms. He was unable to hook it up in the bedroom, so I asked him to temporarily hook it up in my family room. He left and I contacted Comcast the following day asking them to have someone out and take care of the electricity. I spoke to a supervisor who did not call me back until the following day. This went on for a couple of days. An electrician was finally sent out on August 20th. The electrician had to cut 4 squares out of the wall in the office in order to find the wires.I then started contacting Comcast to let them know that I needed to have someone come back out and hook the internet up where I actually wanted it to be. I also let them know that I would need someone to come out and fix my wall. I no longer dealt with the supervisor I started with. I was passed to another supervisor who I have been talking to. She told me she would take care of it and would call me back before she left for the evening. I never heard back from her.I then called Comcast and I was directed to another supervisor because the customer service agent wouldn't put me through to the second one I was dealing with. The process of my explaining the situation started all over again. This went on from August 21-30th. I am still waiting on a phone call regarding the wall and the hook up. I have spent many hours on the telephone explaining what is going on. I have taken two days off work. I waited for the technician on August 13th and another day waiting for the electrician. I suppose I will have to take more time off work waiting for someone to fix my wall and the installation, again. I've been sitting on the floor in the family room for over 2 weeks because I have nowhere else to put my desktop computer on."
1,"I was sent a letter in the mail saying my ""bundle promotion"" was ending and that I could sign up for a 12-month offer of Digital Starter Cable and Internet or accept my higher rate when my ""bundle promotion"" expires. When I told them we were not told we were receiving a ""bundle promotion,"" I held for 20 minutes, and then talked to Chris. Chris proceeded to tell me I was wanting for a Cadillac but willing to pay for a Toyota Tercel. I will evaluate alternatives to Comcast and plan to never use their services again."
1,"Comcast Cable is running a monopoly in my area. There is continuous poor service given by this company. I have heard it from everyone I know and there is nothing we can do about it! They are the only service provider in the area! Their service is horrible. They constantly set up service calls with 4-hour window and then don't show up or even call! What is a consumer to do with this? Why doesn't the government step in? If you google Comcast complaints, the lists are endless and there is nothing we, as the consumer, can do. They get away with it. This is a monopoly! Something has to be done. They raise their rates constantly and the service they offer keeps declining. It is not right! I was given a 12 to 4 pm window; this go around and no one showed up or called. From 4 pm until now, every telephone line in the local office is offline! They should be held accountable and a consumer should be given different companies to choose from."
1,"Well they ran an underground cable for my TV and I complained that during the machine cutting, my sprinkler system, water line and the electric line to the 4 solenoids to the different areas, the main box for the timer keeps blowing the fuse. Comcast told me that when the bill is paid, they will send someone to fix it. This is not a professional way of doing things. When they did fix the low voltage line, they didn't do it right. They just wounded the wires and taped them. They didn't seal them or weatherize them. It's a shotty way of doing things. I just bought this place and my yard is drying up. Tell these people to come to fix it before Layton gets on my case and fines me for having a dry lawn."
1,"On August 22, I saw a Comcast truck working on a service box on the lawn between my home and a next door neighbor's house. They proceeded to run an 18 gauge cable 180 feet from the box and down the street crossing my driveway and continuing down crossing other driveways. They put an orange cone out on the sidewalk nearest the box, but on the sidewalk. They left without finishing the job. Today is August 25, and they have not been back to do whatever it is they planned on doing. The cable left out has been a hazard to the children playing, people walking up their driveways, trash men, and mailmen. There is a potentially hazardous box left unsecured with cables running out of it.I called Comcast yesterday and was told they are scheduled to come tomorrow, Aug. 26 and there is nothing they can do about it to expedite an unsafe situation. I asked to speak to a supervisor and when connected to another person, it was to no avail. Today I called again, and was redirected to an office in Canada where two youngish sounding women, kept telling me they were sorry, but nothing could be done. I was never notified previously by Comcast when any work would be done, and what work was being done. Consequences: An unsafe, hazardous situation for children and adults. Spending useless time on the telephone causing me to use up my valuable work time."
1,"I switched to Comcast three months ago with triple play service (cable, internet and phone). Within three months, I have twice experienced total service blackout; all three services blown out. The very recent it happens around midnight. Unfortunately, I was working. Everything went out just like that. Thereafter using my cell phone, I called and the customer service agent told me that they are doing maintenance and the services were out until 7:00am, seven hours service outage without prior notice! These people don't care. They can do maintenance without any advance notice to their customers. Basically, they can cut you off whenever they want for any reason. How hard is it to send a maintenance notice to clients, while they can get you in any way when bills are past due even a single day? The customer agent I spoke just said, ""Sorry, there is nothing we can do."" But then the next day when I called in, the agent said, ""Yes, there was maintenance and you were supposed to be notified. Sorry if you didn't know."" I asked to talk to the supervisor; the supervisor basically said the same story and offered me a credit for $2.99. I lost my work and someone in the house who was doing online exam end up failing because of Comcast's mess. Bottom line, Comcast, they don't care or value their customers. What they care is the money they collect. I decided to cancel my services and I advice anyone looking for these kinds of services to stay away from Comcast. They don't deserve to be awarded with free money!"
1,"They sold me the HD Premier ""triple play,"" which includes digital voice line for a total of $179.99. Then on my bill, they charge an extra $3 per month for the modem. I asked how this made sense. If the $179.99 includes digital voice and the modem is necessary to have the digital voice, then how can they charge me extra for it. It is fraudulent to claim one price for the service and then say that you need an extra (not previously mentioned) to use the service."
1,"After years of terrible service and increasing monthly bills with misc. fees, taxes and charges, I have turned off my cable service. There must be a class action lawsuit against Comcast. They have all kinds of TV advertisements for special promotions that are never close to the amount billed. My area experiences numerous outages, yet the credits for downtime do not come close to the fees charged monthly. This monopoly must be broken."
1,"On August 3, 2009, I called Comcast and explained the services I would like to order. (I was matching the services apples for apples to what I currently had.) I requested phone service with unlimited long distance, internet, and cable with a basic line-up with DVRs. The lady gave me a quote for this of $140.82 a month. I agreed, and the appointment was set up for the 13th. She said she would handle the phone service disconnection, and I needed to call my other providers to cancel service, so I canceled service for August 12.On Wednesday, August 12, 2009 (1st day off work), Comcast has an appointment between the hours of 11:00-2:00. Comcast called my home at 10:15 to tell me the install tech would arrive between 12:00-1:00 (I thought great, I can get a few more things done.) The tech arrived at 11:00. He assessed the situation and said he would have to call a supervisor out because of 250 feet of cabling that would have to be done and would inform me of the supervisor's decision. I don't know if the supervisor ever came out, but by 12:30, the tech was gone and never informed me of what was going on. So, I assumed maybe he went for lunch and would return. He never returned, so I started calling Comcast. The first customer service rep told me to be patient and someone would contact me shortly. It didn't happen. I called 4 more times to Comcast. I was told that they were sorry and they would have a supervisor call me back in 30 minutes - same story by all of them. I was at the house waiting on a call till 8:30.Now, I'm very angry. It's a wasted day of vacation. Now, I have no internet service and no TV, and I'm left out in the cold with Comcast. I called my boss to ask for another day off work, so I can get my service with Comcast because certainly they would take care of it. (It's the 2nd day off work.) I started calling Comcast, and I'm passed around to 3 different people and repeated my story over and over again. I'm finally told I would have to wait for a callback with an appointment time. But I'm reassured that something would be done today. I received a call from Comcast letting me know I have an appointment set up for Friday, the 14th.On August 14 (It's the 3rd day off work, but an exciting day because we were going to really get hooked up with service this day. I live in a house with 2 guys and no TV.), the tech arrived around 10:30 and also a cable crew. They both agreed that the cable they were about to lay would not give me a signal at my house but they have to do it anyway and try it. The cable crew completed their work and left the cable on the ground, because they felt they were going to have to upgrade the cable later in the day. The tech was here until 4:00. He was able to get my internet hooked up as well as the phone service, but there's no signal for the cable TV and no DVR boxes. I also told him I didn't want the voice mail. He said he would disconnect it at the box. (He didn't do this.) He said he would call it in and a crew should be back this day to replace the cable and bring boxes. So, I waited till 6:00 and called. I was told I have to request an order with Comcast, so I called Comcast They told me that this would be an additional charge of $60; I was quoted a original price of $140. Once again, I was passed around to 3 people and repeated my frustrating story over and over again. The last person I spoke with said that for 3 DVR boxes, my bill would be about $140. I told them to bring them (2 DVRs and 1 HD DVR). I was told to call back to the dispatch center for an approximate time of the new cabling. They said they would send a supervisor out Saturday.On August 15 (It's the 4th appointment for Comcast, and I had no time off work.), the supervisor arrived around 1:00, listened to my frustrations, installed an amplifier, and informed me I would be charged for this. He came inside and checked the signal strength. There's not enough strength for cable. He agreed that the cabling inside and outside all needed redone and that he himself along with a crew would come on Monday, the 17th to do this. (It's my 4th day off work.) No one ever came on Monday, so I called dispatch. They have no order in their system. I would have to call Comcast. Now, I'm very pissed. Comcast customer service what a treat; once again. I was passed around. They told me someone would call with an appointment time. It looked like it would be Friday. I got a call on Thursday with an 11:00-2:00 time. Ok for me.On August 21 (It's the 5th day off work.), I got up and went to use my phone and I had no service. I tried my internet, and there's no service. So, I decided not to make another aggravating call to Comcast and just waited for the tech to show up and he could address it. I went out on my deck to water my plants, and my garden hose was missing. I thought how strange someone would steal my hose. An hour later, I saw a man on my deck returning the hose. I was frightened and run in the house to call the police. As I was phoning, I was looking out the front window and realized it's the cable crew leaving my house. (Thanks, guys, for showing up, but you should have informed me that you were here and I would have no phone service for a while.)The tech showed up at my house at 1:30 to install an amplifier. I informed him that an amplifier has already been installed over a week ago and I thought he was here to bring me my DVR boxes and replace the inside cabling. He said he could not do anything, except what was on his order and that his order showed the equipment that I had in my house and I already had DVRs. It's not true. I asked him if he could at least come in and check the signal strength since the ground cable was just replaced. He came in, checked it, and told me no and that the whole house would have to redone and the original installation was done wrong. Something outed the splitters. He said I would have nothing but problems. He said before he left my house that he would be calling in with his recommendations and also let them know I have no DVR boxes. I called dispatch about 30 minutes after he left to see what was next. I was told once again to call Comcast. They have nothing in the system. I called Comcast and explained. She told me she wanted to read the notes on file and would call me back. She called back and transferred me to the technical department. This gentleman I talked to said he would get someone out tonight with the DVR boxes and set an appointment up for the re-cabling on Saturday, the 22nd, so that I didn't have to take another day off work. Well, guess what? No one showed up Friday evening, and no one called for an appointment for Saturday. What I did get from Comcast on Saturday was a bill. I feel I should only be charged for internet service and phone service. I should not be charged for rental of the boxes that are not working and are not the right ones anyway. I should not be charged for digital voice that I didn't want, and the tech was to disable it anyway. I should not be charged activation charges or other fees due to my time off work and aggravation. And still, there's no cable TV service. I was still waiting on my boxes and cable TV to be re-wired on Monday, August 24. I called dispatch, and I was told they have no order in the system and couldn't do anything till Comcast send a work order. I talked to Heavier, the supervisor, who made a promise to me and didn't fulfill it. He gave me a line of ** that I didn't appreciate. I want someone to follow through with this and be accountable. I next called Comcast to talk to a supervisor. I was told she would have to call me back. I told them I would hold till she was available. Tandra, a Comcast supervisor, told me she was going to do an investigation and get back with me in a couple of hours. She also gave me a customer satisfaction department phone number. I will be calling now. (I'm angry, frustrated, and out of vacation days.)"
1,"I called Comcast to install an additional cable outlet into my parent’s bedroom because their TV in that room didn't work when digital was switched over. I came to their home three times from an hour away just to have them not call or show up. Finally, when they did come and complete the work, we were charged for two additional outlets and I was able to resolve that issue after two arguments that there weren't two put in. When I called to set up the first appointment to have the installation done, the man offered to get a free digital box. I questioned the free work and he told me we were paying already for that package and we could have the box free if we wanted. He encouraged, so I asked my mother and she said only if there was no additional charge. After receiving the box, they had constant problems with it. The cable company was saying it wasn't their equipment but it was my parent's TV. Finally, they sent someone out after they weren't sure what to do. The technician discovered it was the cable box and left a new one. A few days later, they again had the box fail and just said enough and they decided to drop the box off when they were near the cable company at their next doctor appointment. (It was more trouble than it was worth.) I received the bill twice now and was shocked to see all the charges. They were in fact charged for Broadcast HD from having the box that we were told was free and also were charged service charges of $36.99 each time they came out that we were never told would be a charge to send a technician for their faulty equipment. I have called and left a message with a manager since the lady on the phone refused to resolve this issue and also asked to speak with the original person that set up these appointments and told me the box was free. I haven't heard anything back and would like any information on how to resolve this issue. I am upset that they can do this to people and they surely get by with it because some people won't fight these issues."
1,"Comcast has a monopoly and doesn't care what they do to your home. We just bought a historical house in Galveston. The house was built in 1873 and had one cable line, which Comcast said was not active. After considerable delays and broken appointments and no-shows, a subcontractor of Comcast came out to the house to wire us for internet and cable. He arrived right before dark and proceeded to wire out the outside of our house in the dark. The next morning we saw what he had done. He ran six black wires all around the street side of the house - being on a corner, that meant that these ugly black cables were strung all over the visible outside of our house. The internet didn't work and a Comcast employee came out and fixed it. He was followed by two other sets of installers to fix the box and the internet which worked so sporadically that it made watching TV a real chore.The wires had been spliced and were spliced again, making the signal barely usable for internet and DVR box. These latter men actually laughed at the installation and commented that it was one of the worst installations they had ever seen. We called to have someone come out and do something about the wiring, but they told us there was nothing to be done. Eight wires, six new ones and two old ones wrap around the front of our house, go up the side of the house and look horrible. No one at Comcast cares. Since they have a monopoly on cable TV, they believe that they don't have to satisfy a customer. Please bring on some competition, Comcast needs it to be honest."
1,"I've had financial difficulties so I was paying my bill late for about five months. My bill is due on the 4th and I was paying it whenever I could. I got my finances together and wanted to find out how to get the late charges off my account, because if you're late one month, they add late charges for the next month. I talked to a woman on the phone for about forty minutes. She explained to me when my account is due. She told me that to get the late charges off my account, I would have to pay my bill before the 14th and the next month, the late charges would be off. I paid my bill before the 14th. I got my bill and there were late charges."
1,They overcharged me for the move of service from one residence to another. Website says free movement of service but $141.80 was charged for the move. I called the company and the lady argued with me that I agreed to the cost of the move and upgrades to my service.
1,"We requested cable, internet, and phone service to be changed to a new location but requested that phone service be kept at old location. Comcast cancelled telephone service anyway at old location. They are making us wait five days to get new service and will not give us our old phone number. We have a son who has leukemia. The hospital, doctors, and school all have our cancelled phone number. We do have cell phones but we only previously gave out our cancelled home phone number. This is leaving us in a precarious situation. It will consume large amounts of time to contact every medical contact."
1,"Comcast customer service and the competence of their employees leave much to be desired. I understand that call centers have a turnover rate like burgers in a fast food joint, but how about investing in a little training and quality control? Everything started several years ago when I received a bill in excess of $600 for my $44.95/month internet service. The charges, it turns out, were justified, but due to an egregious billing error on Comcast's part. It turns out they were billing someone else for my service and Comcast corrected the error. They demanded immediate payment in full. Eventually, we were able to work out an arrangement and the balance was paid over time, but don't think I didn't have to fight tooth and nail to get them not to cut off my service.Later they, pulled the bait and switch on me twice. I was coaxed into signing up for television service with a 6-month promotional rate. After 4 months, the promotional rate ended without explanation. I was able to get a similar promotional rate for another 6 months, but not long into that, my internet connection stopped working. After several frustrated phone calls, I finally reached a competent young lady who discovered the rate code I was using was no longer valid. Why are they canceling promotional rate codes that are actively being used? Eventually, she was able to find a valid rate code and the service was resumed.Finally, I decided to cancel my television service, mostly because I just didn't have the time for it. I called Comcast and they canceled my TV service. The next month, I had new charges for a different channel lineup. This was the last straw. I called to cancel my service entirely, they reversed the incorrect charges for the new service I had not ordered and informed me my service would be canceled on or about the 20th of April. Fine. The following month, instead of a final bill with a few dollars due, I have new charges for the previous month of service! Comcast recognizes the order to cancel on 4/20 and once again, assured me everything will be taken care of. The new charges are reversed. Next month, more new charges for television service! They did manage to cancel my internet though. Of course, another frustrated phone call and assurances that the problem would be corrected followed.Now in August, I'm fighting off the collection agency for services billed after I canceled. These goons hired by Comcast are even less understanding than Comcast. They demand payment, period. They accept no explanation, there is no appeals process and they won't even bother to check with Comcast to verify any of the information I'm giving them. Only Comcast can reverse the collection attempts, but I can't even get through to them anymore - ""The phone number you entered does not appear in our records."" So 4 months after attempting to cancel my service, they've completely removed me from their system, yet somehow I still owe them money? Great. I was somehow able to find a hole in their automated menu and got through to a real person. Now the middle of August, I have once again been assured by Comcast that everything will be taken care of. I called back several days later to verify and they've confirmed that my account now shows $0 due. I guess we'll see."
1,"I ordered service (Internet and digital cable) from Comcast when I moved here mid-December 2008. This is where the problems began. Setting up the Internet service on their network required installation of software on my computer. Fortunately, I had the software monitored as it was installing so that I could fully remove it afterwards. This software installation requirement means that an end user cannot use Linux as their only platform when activating service with Comcast.Nothing in the DOCSIS specification forces end users onto a particular operating system, nor should it. Within the first 72 hours of activating service, I was losing connectivity to the Comcast network, but not in the sense of the modem or the router losing connectivity. Instead, the Comcast network kept trying to force me through their self-installation mechanisms as though their network forgot my modem's DOCSIS mac address.For the next three months, I would lose connectivity, but not by the loss of communication with the modem. Instead, the Comcast CMTS would refuse to communicate with my router (or PC, when connected directly) regardless of the lease time remaining on the DHCP assignment from Comcast's CMTS. Starting in March, the only change was the duration before I would have to reset my equipment to maintain connectivity. That time frame went from losing connectivity every seven days to every four days.This all changed from being an annoyance to a borderline complete service interruption on August 16, 2009 at 7:30 pm EDT. At this time, I lost connectivity and had to restart my router before the CMTS would give a new address. Following this reboot, I am now losing connectivity every 1 hour and 45 minutes, give or take two minutes (though this two-minute window may have to do with the time it takes to reboot my equipment and obtain a new lease).Currently, the 1 hour and 45 minute window means that to maximize my network connectivity, I would have to reboot my network on average 13 times a day, which by any reasonable person's standards would be considered completely unacceptable. Additionally, this reboot must be done manually as the Comcast CMTS is not permitting a DHCP release and renew, which means that any equipment that follows the RFCs related to DHCP (or it's predecessor BOOTP) must either get a successful release or wait for the lease timeout before the new lease (in this case 30 days). Under these circumstances, without manual intervention on my part, I would have Internet access for 1 hour and 45 minutes out of every 30 days.I contacted Comcast about the connectivity issues and was told that an appointment could be set up for Tuesday of next week at the earliest, even though they do see that I am receiving a poor signal from their network. This precise change from exactly four days between reboots to precisely 1 hour 45 minutes is just too exact to be related to a physical network problem - and instead screams of a configuration issue on Comcast's network. This is especially evident considering there were no changes on my network to coincide with this severe reduction in an already poor quality and overpriced service.Now, for some background on my networking history:I have worked in telecommunications as a technician for the last decade (full 10 years) and am Cisco-certified. Additionally, I work for an ISP and perform both installs and re-grooms on ATM, Frame Relay, VPN, and MPLS private networks, in addition to Internet connections with or without BGP for customers with circuit sizes ranging from 56k up to bonded 10GigE and everything in-between.I have also had cable Internet service with the following previous providers (based upon my residence at the time): Cable One, Charter, Time Warner, and now, Comcast. Over that history of Internet access, I have tried various routers from several different vendors and the current router and modem have operated successfully for months on end (longer than the DHCP lease time for each of those networks) without the necessity to reboot my equipment (modem or router) at any time besides those of my own choosing while operating on All of those cable providers listed previously except for Comcast. It has only been since operating on Comcast's network that it has been necessary to constantly reboot."
1,"I ordered this service 2 weeks ago for installation of a phone and cable jack in the office with DVR free for 6 months, regular box for the Master's bedroom, and basic for the 3rd room. When the tech entered my parent's home, he started by saying what he would not be able to do, not introducing his self or his company. We have a wireless router and wireless printer. He was not helpful in ensuring that all these were operational and was not the most helpful tech I have seen this company have. We are still needing assistance getting our fax/printer combo to function and would still like cable installed in this room. Once I signed off on the bill, I noticed charges that were not incurred during installation nor were these charges discussed at the time of ordering."
1,"A Comcast employee driving vehicle ** was here to service one of my tenants. As he was leaving, my puppy ran out into the common hall area. I, a couple of seconds later, heard the puppy yelp. I went out the common hall area to investigate. As the gentleman was going down the stairs, I asked if he had done something to my puppy and he became extremely rude. When I asked if he had kicked or stepped on my puppy, he said no, then called me stupid. At that time, my mother appeared from the front porch to find out what was going on. I told her the gentleman had somehow caused pain to my puppy which caused him to yelp. She asked the gentleman if he had done something to my puppy and if so, why. The gentleman then called her stupid as well. I don't think a person who clearly has no people skills should be a representative of Comcast. To call me stupid is one thing, but to call my mother something different than her birth given name is something totally different. I expect to hear from a representative of Comcast very soon in reference to this matter. I thank you for your time."
1,"On July 3, 2009, I bundled my landline into my Comcast contract with my existing contract of internet and TV. Since that time, 40 days later, I have had service interruptions with all three services and do not have internet or phone or TV stations that I want to watch. I have called Comcast so many times I estimate I have spent 40 plus hours on the phone with them total since adding my phone on July 3rd. When I talk to CSR, I have to go through the entire scenario again. I am convinced they do not keep a case file when you call. They send out technicians who do not know what they are doing and you spend hours waiting for these technicians to come out and do nothing. They then send maintenance crews out who report back to Comcast that the problem is resolved when it has not been resolved at all. This requires me to spend several hours on the phone again, calling Comcast to start all over again.One CSR, after spending 2 hours on the phone with her, told me it was my modem. I went out and purchased a modem and returned that evening to have Comcast tell me it was not my modem. I have no access to my landline, internet, email or TV channels that I wish to watch. My bill for this month is $250. After spending 10 hours on the phone being transferred from department to department, I finally got a customer service rep who agreed after 40 days of no service to refund my monthly bill. But this problem has gone over a month's bill. I asked him not to send a tech out my house who couldn't do anything and he sent one anyway. I unknowingly signed their yellow sheet which has on it that I am responsible for the bill and that I am not requesting further services at this time. In addition, the tech said he was putting his phone number on the service paper and that I could call him anytime tomorrow if the maintenance guy did not fix the problem. When I looked at the service paper today (problem still not fixed), I realized that he deliberately did not press hard enough on the original for his phone number to come through to the copy. Comcast systemically lies to its customer. It is institutionally deep and part of Comcast's underhanded training policy. I am still waiting for internet, phone and TV services after 40 days of interrupted service. Comcast denies this service interruption is a result of adding in a landline, but I believe it is and they are not willing to admit they cannot provide those services to this area. However, they are willing to take my money for services they cannot deliver."
1,"I am amazed every day that a company as badly run as Comcast can stay in business. I have had them replace either a DVR or cable box about once every other month. I have had them take up to 6 months to bury a cable in my yard. The last time I ordered 1 adaptor for digital to analog and 1 cable box, they sent me two adaptors (only one of them worked and they took 2 weeks to come out and fix that). I called them 4 weeks ago to bury a cable (that they laid down because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the old one). They hadn't come out for 2 weeks, so I called to check on them. There was no call logged from my original request. Needless to say, I waited 2 more weeks to get them out here. As soon as AT&T completes their roll out of web TV which they are currently working on in my area, I am done with Comcast. I hope everyone drops them like a bad habit and they go down in flames. Anyone working for them deserves to be out of a job!"
1,"Comcast raised their prices again! I am disabled, and my husband is a senior citizen. We cannot afford these prices with our income! We could always give up some food! I hear their profits are up 53% the first quarter this year! They are vampires sucking the family life line out of today's financially stressed families. I asked the customer service person on the phone to send me a breakdown of the service charges and tier level charges but was told I had to ""go pick it up"" at an office. That is a great service for the elderly and crippled! Comcast is a self-feeding glutton!"
1,"It's not new that everyone hates Comcast, but we have been trying for weeks to have Comcast simply hook up our cable. This is the 5th time they have either showed up to our apt, not called and simply left (while we were sitting waiting for them), called at the last second to cancel and now for the 5th time, simply not showing after the 5th time we have either taken off work early or stayed home from work. Comcast has twice provided 12-hour windows in which we've been here and both times, had not shown up. They do nothing but say sorry, with very little effort to investigate and ensure the problem won't happen again. As you can see, it happened 5x for a very simple cable card. I have never had a worse experience with any other company."
1,"On August 13th, around 1:00 am, while I was on net checking my email, my Internet service got interrupted with wide area outage. When I called the Tech Support, they said that their engineers were working on it. They had no ETA so I decided to follow up with them in morning. According to the automated service, there was still an outage. I then decided to speak with one of the Tech Supports and they claimed that there is no outage in my area (I don't know who to believe now). I asked the CSR to help me out by escalating my request. They said they have escalated my request and for me to expect a phone call within an hour. However, it has been more than hour now and I still have not received any phone calls. What a service. Comcast is a very monopolistic company. Their CSRs are very immature and they don't know what the hell they are talking about. I wish I could have another service."
1,"They used a dubious practice to gain customer, offered a ""promotional package"" which was not honored as the area just 30 minutes away is not Nashville. Yet, their representative came to the door here with a promotion which was less than half of the one delivered.  Bait and Switch is the basic term used."
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for many years. I never have been a satisfied customer, just one who gave up complaining once the level of service was at least tolerable. Anyway, my latest issue with Comcast is one that I believe all Comcast customers should be aware of and complain to the Better Business Bureau, local news stations, or state attorney general's office about. Since the much talked about nationwide digital conversion took place, Comcast has decided to do an internal digital conversion. They are migrating channels in an effort to save bandwidth, and this migration means that all customers who are currently receiving signal to a TV without any type of box will have to install a digital box or DTA (digital adapter) in order to continue to receive the channels they currently pay Comcast for. Comcast says this will not cost the customer any more, and in support of that, is saying they will provide (for free) up to (2) DTAs. Any additional will cost you $1.99/month. I don't know about you but I have a whole lot more than three TV's (Comcast is offering a total of 1 digital box, and 2 DTAs), so that means if I want to keep my same level of service on all my TV's, I need to spend more per month. This means more electrical equipment plugged into outlets in my house, costing me more per year to run (admittedly, not that much). It also means having to hide stupid little boxes on all my TV's (try hiding these things around small flat screens), as well as having to deal with yet another remote for every TV. But the best part is that once you install these little suckers, you can kiss your ability to use VCR's and DVR's good-bye. Why? Well, think about it, these recorders need to be hooked directly to all cable channels so they can tune the selected ones in at the selected times for your recordings. The problem is the boxes only output one channel at a time. So unless you only record on one channel, you're screwed. But, that's okay, Comcast is more than happy to sell you a DVR subscription.Personally, I feel Comcast is guilty of pulling a bait and switch on their newer customers, and just plain screwing the rest. I mean, didn't I see ads from Comcast touting how their customers had nothing to fear from the digital conversion? Don't you think they got a whole lot of new customers from the fear-mongering ads? Do you think that any of those new customers were told that virtually within weeks or months of their signing on-board with Comcast, that they would be facing an internal digital conversion that would force them to take on more equipment and/or pay higher monthly charges? I doubt it. I'm sick and tired of being pushed into an ever smaller corner with respect to my television entertainment options, and feel it's time for us all to push back. Write anyone you can think of about this. Don't stand for it."
1,"Comcast was enticing with their $99 triple play option, but I was skeptical because I had bad problems in the past with them. I spoke to Joe at **, extension ** and discussed my options. I wanted to be very careful because switching from DTV was going to cost me $120 early termination fee. Not only did I speak to him, but called him back with questions. I wanted full disclosure of the fees and my monthly bill, which Joe gave me. The bill came. The service was to the penny of what was disclosed, but wait a minute, what is this extra $5.81? I called and was told, ""Too bad. That's for rental of the modem."" Rental of the modem? I demanded it be taken off of my bill. I was also told, ""Too bad. Everyone pays that."" I asked for a supervisor. Same crap. I did a live chat with the company. I was told the same crap! Is that not the old bait and switch routine that is illegal? Yes, it is, but Comcast doesn't care. Now today, another issue I discussed with Joe, ESPN classic was removed from my line up and I will have to pay and extra $7.95 a month to get it back. Shame on you, Comcast. You are still the dirty birds I remember from the last time I hooked up with you. Now, I am stuck for two years. I have a feeling they won't come through on the rebate I was promised either."
1,"As of today, 8/11/09, Comcast has transitioned their basic cable service to digital for its customers. Error notices appear on your TV that these channel are no longer available, only in digital format. This eliminated all but the basic TV channels for customers paying $21 a month for service. There is now no HGTV, CNN, The Weather Channel, etc. You only get a handful of channels.Customers must now add (Comcast) equipment and now pay a monthly charge of $55.75. After the digital transition, everything was fine (in my home anyway). Now, overnight that has changed. They have screwed their customers and once again gotten away with it. This is a crime. In this economy? Regulators have obviously allowed this to happen and people need to complain to the FCC and their local county Cable TV Franchise regulators.Comcast said they notified customers. I never received that notification however."
1,"I received approx. $28 charge on the bill to have their tech guy come out to fix their service. How can Comcast be charging their customers to fix their service? It might not seem like a big deal, but when you multiply all these charges that consumers should not be paying for, it borders on illegal. At no time did Comcast tell me when I called them that a charge was being imposed. It just shows up on the bill."
1,"Each month after the initial start-up of $99 per month, the bill kept going up and up. The Triple Play Package (phone, tv, and internet) you chose had no meaning; they mislead you. They come back 3 months down the road to say they did not charge for the internet. Then later you find all of the charges and you call and call, and still no resolution. And they still charge more and think you are supposed to be good with it."
1,"Wow, this site is great! This will be one of numerous complaints I file against Comcast. I am a really nice person and I could not be any angrier than I am currently. I moved on June 11th down the street and simply wanted to transfer my service over. On the first appointment, the technician said he did not have a long enough cable to complete the installation. I said I have one at the old house and will be back in 5 minutes. He said okay. When I came back, he was gone! I called support and they said the techs have to stay on a schedule, but they can reschedule the appointment. The next appointment I was ready for them and they didn't show up. I called and they said the tech called to say he was on his way and no one responded. I was in a place where I don't have signal, but I would have been home at the appointment time for the entire window. The third time the guy simply didn't show - no call, no nothing. I called support and without apology they said they don't know why nobody came, but all they can do is reschedule me. I asked for a supervisor and they hung up on me. I immediately ordered DirecTV and that has been installed successfully - the first time! But there’s still no internet. I made another appointment since Comcast has a monopoly on internet here and they finally came about 2 weeks later. Three weeks for the first appointment date I got internet. Then, I got my bill and it showed that my request for cable cancellation had not been received and they decided to start charging me for renting their modem, which I never did. I called 1-800-Comcast and they said it was the wrong department and transferred me to Maryland. Maryland said since I lived in DC I would need a different number, and for some reason I got transferred to NY! They said sorry and transferred me back to 1-800-Comcast who finally got me to the cancellations department - after 4 hours of holding and transferring! The cancellations department said everything was fixed. Then I got another bill - no changes. I went for the live chat and after doing that for an hour she said, “It's all fixed. Ha-ha-ha.” I just got my bill: $236.10. Nothing has been fixed. The modem’s still on there. There are no payment credits, no missed service credit, the cable still being charged, and the internet is not prorated for June. And there are some late fees! I just contacted live support again. They said there is nothing they can do, but a supervisor will be contacting me soon. Yeah, right, I'm not holding my breath."
1,"I was having playback problems with my DVR, both picture and sound, so I set an appointment to get a new one. When the technician came, the first DVR was making mechanical noises so the technician went back to his truck and brought in a second DVR. After 2 days, I was experiencing gaps in playback of no sound. So, I called for another DVR which had 30 shows existing on it that I had to manually erase, and Channel One On Demand does not work even after unplugging for 30 seconds to reset the unit (no help). The sound only works when I have it on full volume (totally unacceptable). In other words I got some old broken box. What gives with Comcast quality, it is sadly lacking."
1,"My payment was late and I received a notice to pay by August 5th to avoid interruption of service. I called and paid my past due balance on the 4th (I was out of town taking care of sick grandparents and my house-sitter told me about the notice). On the phone, the customer service rep informs me that everything's already been shut off with sort of a ""too bad, so sad"" type of attitude. Thinking it was ridiculous, but understandable since my bill was paid late, I went ahead and paid another $205.00 for installation of new service (note the cost of service went up from what I had before). We set an appointment for 8/08/09 between 8 and 11 am for installation. When I got home, I saw that notice indeed said that I had until the 5th to pay. I called Comcast back wanting to keep my old phone number and was informed that they didn't even have an appointment set up! I could hear the woman laughing at me over the phone. She thought it was hilarious and refused to send someone out on the original date of my appointment. My account has been debited $535.00 and I have no phone, internet or cable services. Hopefully, I don't have to call 911 during this time.Services were disconnected before the date on my due notice. The home phone number was given to someone else (I must change numbers). The package I had has now gone up over $10.00 a month in price from the one I was guaranteed for a year. They are charging me installation fees when no new installation should even be required. I currently have been charged for services and yet have none. This is just as if they stole the money out of my account. They have taken my money and provided nothing that they were supposed to. This is completely unfair and they only get away with it because they are practically a monopoly here and they know that there is just absolutely no accountability for the way they treat their customers. "
1,"I had some medical/financial issues and my cable was turned off on 5/30/09. On 7/26/09, I called to pay and restore services. When my services did not come on, I called and was told I did not make a payment (sarcastic). I have a confirmation number. I asked for supervisor who told me the rep put my money on the wrong account from 1996. I don't I owe a bill (I need my money; no help). Then, they said I damaged a box. Another rep said I owe service charges. They cannot even give me a solid answer as to where my $237.00 is. There’s no luck with five supervisors."
1,"I have been calling Comcast almost on a daily basis, as I am receiving a terrible signal to my television. Numerous techs have been to the house and have confirmed that the problem is not with my system but outside my home. Additionally, one tech confirmed that my entire neighborhood has been having the same trouble. I am paying for a service that I am not receiving. I take time out of my daily schedule to meet with the techs. I am completely frustrated and feel I have no power over my own products and that someone else is controlling my life."
1,"On 6/26/09, I made a call for a service appointment, because my On Demand wasn't working. I had 9 technicians here and numerous calls to the call center, and it still isn't fixed. I have had 6 new boxes installed, and at times, other issues occurred. I lost my premium channels (HBO, Starz), there's no universal caller ID, and the other box in the house doesn't have On Demand either. There was a day we got strange messages on our TV, and even the tech didn't recognize them. After the 5-6th time I spoke with a technician's supervisor, he assured me the next technician who comes would be a senior tech. Well, guess what. He wasn't. So my issues fell on deaf ears. They kept sending techs to replace the box, and the issue was still there.After the 9th tech visit, I got a supervisor involved because the tech replaced the DVR box I had with a non-DVR box. Stupid. So the supervisor scheduled an appointment for today versus an appointment on Saturday without me knowing, and I got a recorded call that it has been cancelled since I didn't confirm it. I didn't know about it. I gave Comcast 10 tries to fix my issue, and these were the chances I got for a confirmation. This supervisor George should have tried a little harder. Now I have no appointment, because today's appointment wiped out this Saturday's appointment, and the next available is Tuesday. I am through. You bought Patriot Media, and it seems like you cannot handle your new customers or don't care to. So, you have forced me to go to Verizon, which I don't want to do; but I have no choice. I just wanted someone to know what I went through. I needed cable more now, since I am bedridden since June and will be till November. I need all cable has to offer to keep me occupied. I am not paying my last bill. I feel for all the time I sat here waiting for a tech to come and all the hours on the phone that I deserve a free month!"
1,"All I wanted was cable TV installed to one unit with DVR and wireless internet capability. A rep showed up on Monday, 8/3, and as soon as he left, everything died. He had the wrong box (with no DVR), and the box he left did not work adequately. I have spent the rest of the week (through today, 8/6) trying to get it fixed. They lie and say anything to get me off the phone."
1,"I continue to have ongoing service and billing issues with Comcast from equipment failure to incorrect billing. The current issue dates back to the end of 2008 when I added on a bundle package in which I got internet, phone, and cable. When I received my first bill, I noticed that it stated HBO, SHO, and STARZ. I called Comcast back in November, and they stated it was an error. The December bill came, and it still stated I should have HBO, SHO and STARZ for the next couple of months. I continued to argue with Comcast, until a customer service actually took the time to look at my bill and my account; noticed that on my bill, it stated that with my package, it included HBO, SHO, and STARZ; and added the channels on. At no time did this rep state that it was for a limited time. On my July 2009 bill, I noticed that I had over $50 of additional charges for HBO, SHO, and STARZ. I filled out a complaint with the BBB, and I called Comcast because the cycle of billing and service issues was occurring again. Mr. Micheal contacted me, stating that if I wanted the charges removed, he would also have to remove the channels. I told him that at no time was I told by Comcast that those channels were only for a 5- or 6-month period and that evidently, Comcast just thought that they could shut me up from complaining by adding the channels for a limited time. Well, against my request, Mr. Micheal removed the channels. For the new bill for August, I am back at square one; the bill states that I should have SHO, STARZ, and HBO included with my bundle package. However, I don't have the channels. I left Mr. Micheal a message on July 27 that he never returned. I called on August 5 to speak to a manager, and they again transferred me to Mr. Micheal, who blatantly stated that he was not going to correct the problem and he stands by his decision to not allow me to have the channels, though it says I should have them on my bill."
1,"I got a phone message around 5:30 p.m. on Monday, 8-3-09, from Luke, Tech Supervisor, with Comcast. The phone message indicated that they needed to cut up my driveway in order to install underground cable for a neighbor two doors down. He asked me to please call. The call came at 2:21 p.m. They had made a similar request about a year prior and requested to string cable through my property. I denied access for this application because I was out of state and did not understand their intention clearly and it just plain seemed like a bad idea. They did the work at my rental house without my permission. I returned the call the next day. I got no reply and still have not gotten a reply two days later."
1,"We started by having a couple of problems with our cable television service. The first problem is that while watching TV, the picture pixelates. The second problem is the digital recorder records all programs in a series even when set to record only new programs. We called into the customer service center. They tried to fix the problem over the telephone, but could not. They then set up an appointment for a technician to come out. In the last month, we have had at least 4 technicians and one supervisor come out. Although they have replaced lines and switches, the problem continues and now we are having problems with our internet connection which we did not have before. We have been told that the problem is outside our house with their equipment. In addition, although our television equipment does not show the errors, the technicians have seen the picture pixelating.When I received our bill, I noticed that we were charged for 2 service charges. When I called in to question them, I was told that when they have to send out a technician, there is a service charge. I replied that I had never been told about a service charge and, furthermore, if I had called a utility company about my service not working and that company came out and discovered the problem was with their equipment, they would not send me a bill for a service call. I was then told that if I purchased the $.99 monthly wiring insurance, then I would have insurance to cover my wires. I informed them that their ""insurance"" would not have covered our problems and they agreed. After being on the telephone for over 45 minutes and being on hold waiting for a supervisor, Alleen, the customer service rep, waived my service fees. I don't know what else will happen on my next bill as we have had several service calls since then and our problem is not resolved."
1,"I have had Comcast ""high-speed"" internet for about 4 or 5 years now. This is only because they have a monopoly on the cable service here. Anyways, I have a stack of pink copies from technicians about an inch thick if I squeeze it together. Every time they manage to get it working right, it only takes a couple of days, weeks, months to go out again. The most recent problem has been occurring since I signed up for the double play option for both digital TV and high-speed internet. I already had both, but the customer service representative I talked to one night said that I could save some money by signing up for the double play, which, if you read their available options pamphlet, shows the same internet service that I was already paying for. Hah. The download speed stayed about the same, but the upload speed dropped from 2.5 Mbps to 1.5 Mbps, which is a big problem for any online gaming or uploading files.Also, since being put on the double play option, the internet has gone down almost every night - sometimes two or three times in the same night. The outages last from 15 minutes to several hours. I have called and set up technician appointments. Unfortunately, the problem does not seem to occur during the daytime hours that they can come out. The phone customer service people always verify that there is something wrong when I call and always want to send out a technician to check it out. But they can't or won't come out at night when the problems occur.The past week I have had two different technicians come to my home. One swapped out my modem because it was hot, but found no issues with the signal. It went out again that night, so I called again and they said it was a repeat so they would send out a more experienced technician. He came out and said my upstream power was fluctuating and he would get a line technician out probably late at night when the problem was occurring. Later that same afternoon, not at night, a line tech came out and did some work on the lines. He stopped by and said that he fixed something and to call them again if I still had problems. The next day, yesterday, the TV with the digital box hooked up to it went in and out all day on every channel and once again the internet went out at 11:30 p.m.I called the 800 number to tell them it went out again and the representative verified that the signal was not good. He wanted to set up another technician appointment. I told him that unless he could get someone here at night when the problem happens, it would not do any good. I know this from the past 4 or 5 years of experience with Comcast. They must be doing something at night that causes this problem and then switching it back during the day hours. Because at least 20 times technicians during the day come out and find no problems, yet the internet will still go down again that night or within a couple of nights. I usually don't have problems with the internet customer service phone people or the technicians that come to my house. Generally, they are pleasant and somewhat knowledgeable about what they can try to do to fix the problem - well, except when I have called the television service people who seem rather stupid.The problem I have is with their system or ability to provide the service that they sell. Because of that, I really wish that there were other options for the service in this area. Comcast would lose this customer. The politicians that allowed them to have a monopoly without ensuring proper regulatory policies were in place need to be out on their rear ends. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. Since I have had the double play, if I run a trace route (tracert), now the first hop always comes back with 3 time outs. The second hop comes back with times almost twice as long as it was before I got the double play. The double play says 2 Mbps upload speed in their services available guide, not the 1.5 that I get.Separate note: why do they not inform people that there is going to be scheduled maintenance in the area that night? At least then their customers could be prepared for the outage. Instead, the service just goes off and when you call you get a recording saying that it was planned. Apologies if this came through last night, but my internet went out again at about 1:00 a.m. and it didn't come back up until 10 minutes before the Comcast technician arrived this morning at 8:30 a.m."
1,"I'm still on hold while writing this, at 58 minutes so far. The canned message keeps saying that my call is important to them so to keep holding since calls are answered in the order received. There's no excuse for a hold of going on an hour. That shows me that my call is anything but important to them! As far as I'm concerned, Comcast owes me $50 because that's what I earn an hour."
1,"Why does the service shut off and then eventually come back on? This has been going on for weeks. I haven't watched a complete TV program. I have noticed it more frequently since the digital change over. What’s going on? Whenever/if I call the techs, they want to send somebody out and then want to charge me for it. Then, if that's not enough, if you go through the same process again, next week you get tagged again for the charges. Why? When can I get a break and get something for my having to put up with this kind of service? Damn, I nearly have to rent any movies if I want to see the complete show. You miss bits and pieces of a program and you can understand what’s going on. When are you going to resolve the problems?"
1,"Comcast has made changes to their cable service which requires me to purchase additional hardware on a monthly basis just to view the television channels that I am already paying monthly to receive. This change is an underhanded way of raising their fees, plus, it requires me to have more hardware, more remote controls, and more power consumption all at a time when my income has been cut in half by our terrible economy."
1,"After 3 years of being a loyal Comcast customer, I called to cancel my cable TV but keep my internet. The girl informed me that there would be a $25 disconnection fee plus I have to hand deliver their cable boxes and modems. The woman on the phone didn't seem to care about my business or doing anything to make the situation right. Even when I told her I would be taking my business to WOW. I said I'm trying to cut back my expenses and all Comcast is doing is overcharging for everything. I don't feel I should have to pay this fee. But out of fear of damaging my credit, I will reluctantly pay it. "
1,"I am writing this after Comcast put me through 48 hours of hell but it really started over a year ago. I am an avid football fan so I decided after over 15 years of basic cable with Comcast to get a DVR. I researched the DVR and found that it was limited in recording size by 160 gig HD. There was no option to upgrade it internally or externally. Comcast had also made sure the customer could not offload any recordings to a computer or get a different DVR. Everything was no, no, no. I decided to live with it expecting Comcast to eventually allow customers to upgrade.About two weeks ago, with football season approaching, I decided to revisit the DVR situation. I was surprised that it was identical to last year. Comcast has disabled or blocked every possible way to get more recording space. My DVR can record only 20 hours of HD. One HD football game lasts for 4 hours. I could almost fill this DVR up in one weekend of football. This was when a coworker mentioned I should get TiVo. The more research I did, the more I found the answers where yes, yes, yes.The TiVo was highly upgradeable in every way. There was one problem. There is a multitude of horror stories on websites such as comcastmustdie.com and others of Comcast customers who have attempted and failed to get Comcast to do one simple thing (install Comcast cable card in the TiVo box). After researching the situation and considering that I hold a Masters Degree in Information Systems from Kennesaw State University, I figured I could walk a Comcast CSR through the process.I knew from my research that I would be better off to go to Comcast and get the m-card because every part of this process could be done over the phone. It's a simple matter of typing some numbers in a computer (m-card pairing) and sending an initialization hit from the Vinings head end. I also knew that many of the service reps sent out have no idea what they are doing. I won't even go into the trouble I went through to actually get the m-card from Comcast.When my TiVo arrived, I followed the instructions and made sure that the latest software was installed. On Monday night, July 27th, I was ready to make my first of about ten calls to Comcast customer service. The CSR was named Pat. I knew from the online forums what numbers she needed such as host ID and data ID. She said she didn't need all those numbers - that everything would start working in about 45 minutes. Nothing happened so I went to bed and started the next morning.I didn't get the names of every CSR I talked to but I know it was at least 8, and maybe 10. The fact that the first one I talked to didn't set up a case file proves that their entire existence is a joke to Comcast. With a case file, the eighth CSR I talk to will know this. Asking them a question is equal to asking the guy that bags my groceries what to do about my cable TV. Sometime on Tuesday afternoon, one of the CSRs mentioned that she could schedule a field rep to install my cable card the next day. I was exhausted so I reluctantly agreed knowing I may be paying $17 for more misery.Lamont arrived at 12 noon today in a Comcast truck. I started bombarding him with technical information about Val:V missing and the Auth:MP problem. He didn't know what I was talking about but he assured me he would get my cable card working. I took some notes. He called someone at ** using my phone because his was malfunctioning. He told them he was getting an illogical equipment message from the first person (the dispatcher) he called that could not help him. He said it was job number **. He switched the m-card I had received from Comcast with another one. He also solved one mystery.From the second I received the m-card, I was billed for digital service a/o. He said the Comcast rep had charged me for an additional stb instead. These charges were on the bill that I received on Tuesday. I was able to check the conditional access screen (which he knew nothing about) and see that the Val:? had changed to Val:V but Auth:MP still displayed which needs to be Auth:S. He said I was 36th in line to receive an init hit from the Vinings head end. He said I should have all my channels within an hour and he would call back to verify.He assured me that if the init hit failed, he would return to fix it. Indeed, some unencrypted HD channels displayed as he was leaving. I commended him and told him I would keep checking channels until he called. He gave me a receipt and took my Comcast DVR and the original m-card I had received from Comcast. That was about 5 hours ago and no call. Below, I have provided every piece of information Comcast may need to correct these problems. I believe it would take a person with basic knowledge of how to use a computer and telephone about 5 to 10 minutes to fix this problem.The grief this has caused me has made a permanent negative impression on me concerning Comcast. What is the price to pay for that? Right now, my options are limited. I have invested in a TiVo DVR, a year of TiVo service, and football season is coming up. My personal knowledge of technology ensures me that a time will come in the near future that I can rid myself of this Comcast. Consider this: I intended to eventually have Comcast cable, Comcast Internet service and Comcast phone service. Now, I intend to eventually rid my house of all traces of Comcast.In the meantime, this is what must happen in the next 24 hours. I want every single channel that I am paying for restored and an email or phone call from Comcast assuring me that I have been refunded for the erroneous charges and that I am not charged one single minute for the DVR and m-card Lamont took with him. I also will not be charged for Lamont accomplishing nothing. Make sure the $17 is removed. Considering what I have been through, I should receive a month's credit but I can assure you at this point with the time and money this has cost me that would be an insult. You will however give me what's mine. I will not waste my time on the phone with another Comcast CSR and I would prefer that no one else from Comcast be sent to my house.In the event that all of this does not take place at 5:00 pm eastern on Thursday, July 30th, 2009, I will draft a cover letter and place that and this entire email in letters to the president and CEO of Comcast and every member of the board of directors of Comcast, the FCC, the governor's office of Consumer Affairs and the BBB. I also intend to post this email on comcastmustdie.com and any other websites or forum that will allow me. Next week, I plan to start requesting meetings with the President, CEO and members of Comcast board of directors. These people need to hear in person what Comcast is doing to its customers."
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for 8 years. I have used their service (expanded basic cable) in 2 different apartment complexes in the greater Houston area. I scheduled Comcast to install cable and Internet service to my new apartment on 7/24. I gave the representative my new phone number. I was told that a technician would be out between 5-8 p.m.I called Comcast at 6 p.m. to confirm that the technician was coming. I was told that Comcast had tried to call me, but got no answer. I thought that was weird considering that I had my phone right beside me all day. I asked what number they called. The representative told me the number from my previous apartment. I told her that they had the wrong number. She corrected the phone number and said that someone would be calling me shortly. No one ever called or showed up on Monday.I called at 9:30 on Tuesday morning. I was told that my problem had been noted and was labeled ""accelerated"" and since it was early in the morning and slow, someone would be calling me within an hour to send the technician out. No one called. I called back at 1 p.m., and was again told that they were sorry, I would receive a call within an hour. No one called.I called back at 3 p.m. I was told that they were sorry for my inconvenience and was given a $20 credit to my account, and again was told that I would receive a call within an hour. No one called or showed up. I called back at 4:30 p.m., and was told that they could reschedule my installation for a week from that Tuesday or they could resubmit the acceleration, but it could take up to 72 hours (first time I had heard that). I opted to resubmit the acceleration.I called Comcast on Wednesday at 1 p.m. and went through the same story with yet another CSR. I am still waiting and still have not heard anything from a Comcast technician."
1,"I have always had a problem understanding Comcast invoices, and I have always suspected that their invoices are fraudulent, never matching up to what their reps promise verbally. Moreover, if just one of your payments is late for whatever reason, the bills/invoices to come continue to become even more impossible to understand. Their invoices are designed to obfuscate, confuse, and deny access to what they are really doing; bilking the customer out of monies beyond those fees that are agreed to be paid for services rendered.They have no customer service to help sort out their invoicing tactics either. They have an actual store nearby which I went to, but was waiting in line for over 45 minutes, before my back couldn't take standing up any longer. I went home and called their customer service number instead, only to find that it was simply a recording with no links to anyone. Their website had a link with a question, do you wish to open online session with a customer service rep? Clicked on the link and an hour later, I was still waiting to contact someone at Comcast. Isn't there a federal law that requires handicap access, which Comcast has violated here? Feds, where are you?Most critical of all is that it is fairly clear that Comcast is engaging in some kind of illegal billing. This company should be investigated by the authorities, and shut down, to let a more honest broker of communication services replace it. What is really needed now though is for someone from the District Attorney's Office discreetly subscribe to Comcast services and discover the rotten eggs in their billing practices. Comcast is a company that behaves less like a communication company and more like a Jersey mob shop."
1,"Shelbyville, IN is one of the only cities in the country where Comcast Cable does not offer standard basic cable for around $15.99 per month. When the HD changes took place this year, Comcast offered a $10.99 per month special for that service. One in every four people in Shelbyville is disabled, and a large majority of the population is elderly on a fixed income. Yet, Comcast does not give the option of the standard cable in Shelbyville, IN. The elderly residents are forced to choose between paying over $50 per month or not having cable at all. And most of them can not afford a new TV. Jeff, the manager of the Shelbyville office, has been saying for years that they are going to start making that service available; but it never is. They think they are saving money by doing this, but the fact is a lot of people just do without TV."
1,"On March 4, 2009, I discontinued my service with Comcast due to moving to South Florida. My account was paid by credit card and upon receiving my bill in April, the account was noted to have a $22.62 credit on my account #**. In April 2009, I returned to my residence in Orange Park, Florida and had my cable and internet access re-established with Comcast. The young man who came to install my services said he was not the regular installer but was here to do the job. His installation number is **, and he made the statement to me that the modem is running slow. I'm not sure this is working properly. If not, you can take care of it at a later date. These services were completed on April 2, 2009. I paid $156.50 to reinstall Comcast internet and cable. On the evening of April 3, 2009, Orange Park experienced a rather bad electrical storm and my internet went out. On the morning of April 4, 2009, I called Comcast to report no lights on the modem and that I did not have internet service. The young woman from Comcast said there was no signal at my house and scheduled a repairman to come out on Monday to see what the problem was. I waited the entire day but no one showed up. I called that day and according to your voice message, the appointment for service was the following week. Now mind you, why would I want to want an additional week for a repairman if I hadn't had service since the day I had the cable re-installed?I spoke with Eric on April 6, 2009 and he couldn't seem to help me. He kept putting me on hold and then he dropped my call into the Orlando cue and I spoke with someone there who didn't know how I got her and she couldn't help me. I called back the local Comcast number and spoke with Ellen who was very apologetic about the entire situation. She informed me Comcast was very busy and they could not come out to my house to diagnose the problem until Thursday April 8, 2009. I informed her of the above situation and asked her why the other Comcast representative didn't tell me this information but just made an appointment for a week later. Now mind you, I have been without internet service for six days from April 3 to April 8. Per Ellen, she said a $20 credit and no internet charges for April 3-April8, 2009 would be on my bill. I spent over 45 minutes of cell phone use just trying to get someone to come out and fix the problem. This is very poor customer service.When the repairman finally came, he said the cable from the box to the house is completely dead. He also replaced the modem. My bill came this month, and yes, there is a credit of $20 and $7.15. There is also a charge for $30 for T/C Trip charge. Prior to my discontinuing Comcast in March 2009, my husband and I were great Comcast customers. Our account was always paid on time actually before the bill was due. I am very disappointed in Comcast. It appears that lightning must have struck your outside cable but you charged me $30 for this to be assessed. I find it kind of strange that prior to the cable being re-installed, I had the $2.95 service plan and had no problems. I reinstalled the cable and the day I reinstalled the cable/internet, there is a problem with lightning and I get dinged for the service charge. This is not right. I want a tracer to find out where my $22.62 credit is and I want the $30 T/C Trip credited to my bill for next month. I have already paid this month's bill. I have tried to call and speak with someone/anyone about this problem. No one seems to know how to handle the problem. I can be reached at ** should you need to speak with me about this problem. I am enclosing a copy of all bills, credit slips and installation receipt. In this bad economy, cable TV and internet services are a luxury, not a necessity. Can you afford to lose me, a good customer? Check my account. It has always been paid on time. Thank you."
1,"I have been having trouble with my cable. Mainly, it’s with the TV that has a box where you can not see the TV: it is blank. We go days like this and when you make the appointment, they take at least 4 or 5 days to come. If you call on Monday, they come on Thursday. Call on Saturday and they come on Tuesday. One calls and they treat you as if a child is calling with the following questions after telling them yes: “Do you see anything now? Are you sure you are looking at the screen? Is the problem happening to all the TVs?” One asks for a supervisor and they say no one is around or on duty no matter what time or day one calls. They proceed to give you another rep who knows less and starts to ask the same questions and treat you as a child. Please, if we pay late, they cut you for one month of service. They claim to give you a credit, but the bill is always higher and you still have to wait the days. I have 6 kids here and run a daycare and they only know they cannot see TV."
1,"This is a scam, elderly abuse and fraud. They are complicating the accounting methods and then correcting it over the phone and changing it after we pay and then keeping that extra money for their pocket. I got a promotional price of $29.99 per month for 6 months, which comes to about $38 per month for 6 months. But somebody in accounting is reversing after correcting the paid bill and showing the balance in the next bill. I called again and after 15 minutes of talking to their supervisors, it is corrected to $38.00 and the supervisor said, “Okay, now it is corrected so you can mail your payment and there will remain no balance in your account.” I received a bill showing past balance of $89.07 and new charges of only $17.69 instead of $38.00; then, it’s showing a credit of $36.02, but it made a total due of $106.75. Very tricky accounting. They are cheating the elderly who do not understand simple accounting.I have been sending $38 per month, so how do I owe $106.76 now? It should be about the same amount of $38.00. This has been happening every month for the last 4 months and the supervisor corrected the amount over the phone and said to send that payment of $38 and I will owe nothing and we are even. Then the new bills arrived and showed no corrections. They are reversing it after the correction, cheating, and tricking. The same thing has been happening with AT&T. If you do not check, they will take your money and they got away with that. Strange thing is that the supervisors, accountants, and customer service all belong to one group and they are all crooks stealing from customers for their pockets. I rather blame Comcast for billing and accounting fraud. Thanks."
1,"I am very angry right now. I spent a lot of money at Comcast adding a router, adapter and installation. My brother's XP desktop had the adapter and it kept losing the signal. The first technician came here and changed some settings, changed my password and couldn't manage to keep the computer connected. He said we would have to go to Intel and follow their instructions, left and said he was going to contact his supervisor and get back to us as ""I was not going to fool around with technical stuff I did not understand."" I called and a second technician came out. He happened to be the one that made the initial installation and had had a hard time. The computer is older and slower. I tried to explain to him that the computer would not hold the signal and what the first technician had done and said. He stated that he remembered the computer and since my other computer was working okay, it was not Comcast's problem. He never looked at anything. Comcast set up the settings, not me and the first technician changed stuff and I don't know what he did. My son looked into the diagnostics and found that the computer had been set up for a corporate network connection and I had to disable that. I did not set it up that way and either the installer of the adapter or the first technician that came the other day did that. The second technician made me feel stupid and didn't even take the time to look at anything. My son was the one that found the problem for me, as the computer had worked fine previously. All of a sudden, we started getting a message that said ""we would get a better connection if the adapter were plugged into a high speed port"". That message had never occurred before and that is when we started having problems. We may have never understood what was wrong if my son had not been here. I'm just very disappointed as the first technician's supervisor never got back to us, the problem was not written up properly, and the second technician wouldn't even look. I don't want either of them at my house again. I also hope that from now on we get better service."
1,"On Thursday, cable box died. I called Comcast who sent out a tech on Friday at 2. (They said he would call but he never did.) He replaced the cable box, but it needed an HDMI cable, which of course, I didn't have. So he suggested I buy one online and in the meantime, he used RCA cables. No video. He fooled around with my hook ups and my Harmon-Kardon receiver for over 1 hour and finally got picture. He left. I turned off TV to work. I went to turn on TV. No video. I called Comcast. Customer service said they would send someone because I should have been given an HDMI cable since I pay for HD receiver. Wow! All day Friday, no one. Saturday, no one. I called at noon. ""Okay, we'll tell dispatch this is the 2nd call and make it priority."" On Saturday 9pm, nada. I called and heard a message telling me I am scheduled for a tech on Monday between 2-5! I asked to speak to a supervisor, explained my concerns and he hung up on me! I called back and again asked to speak to a supervisor. I got his name first, Aldo, although he tried to talk over me and get my information (for the 5th time today to verify!). I explained my concerns and he tried to talk over me in his macho angry voice like I was wrong, and said HDMI cables are not provided and if I couldn't be there Monday, would I like to reschedule!? I calmly, yet angrily, said, ""No, tomorrow and I would like credit for the days without service."" He said that it can only be done after the technician states the problem is fixed! I said I don't need a technician. I need a cable that I was advised was free since I paid extra for the HD box! He said I was wrong and was there anything else he could help me with. I said if he calls dispatch to let them know how irate I am and that I would be contacting the head of customer service and any other consumer org so they should get out here ASAP!"
1,"We have been customers of Comcast and their affiliates for well over 10 years. They are constantly the only service in the area (which is a monopoly and highly illegal) and they exploit that fact to their fullest extent. The service is poor at best. When there is an outage in the area, they know this as it is logged in their system. This means that their system should automatically issue a day's credit for the service that we couldn't receive. Do you think they would actually do that? Not a chance! When the billing arrives, there is no clear way to understand the billing with all of their 'taxes and fees' that they attach to our bill. You would have to have a 6-year Degree in Economics to even attempt to understand what they are actually charging (not kidding). When you first sign up, they offer you a 'promotional price' that is either six, 12 or 24 months. However, they do not state the length or amount of the promotion remaining on your bill at any time. This means that when you see a bill that is 50% higher than it was the month before, you would understandably freak out. When you call them, they give nothing but excuses, say that they can't give you another promotion for 90 days and that you would have to pay full price for 90 days. And then, they would look into what packages they could offer you at that time. While doing so, they attempt to transfer you many times to someone who has no idea of what they're doing if it is not in their script to read to you. Everything from outright lies, to blaming the customer and claiming that everything is computer-automated and that there's nothing they can do about your issues. In other businesses, you receive price breaks the longer you are with the company in question. For example, if you are a customer for 2 years, you would receive a certain percentage off of your bill. If you are a customer for 5 years, you would receive a larger discount. What they are doing is giving you one price to get you in the door and then raise the price at will after that. In any other business, this is called, 'bait and switch' and is highly illegal in our state. If you, as a customer, contact any company with an issue, they would bend over backwards to do anything to satisfy you in following the old adage, 'The customer is always right.' Does Comcast follow the same adage? Obviously not. That's why you are reading this post. We have done some research and have some numbers for you if you are in Pennsylvania. To contact Comcast's Philadelphia office, you would call 1-(215) 665-1700. Ask to speak to Brian Roberts (COO) or his assistants. If that does no good, consider contacting the United States Department of Consumer Protection. The Harrisburg office is at 1-800-441-2555. If you are not living in Pennsylvania, a quick Google search should give you the local corporate office for Comcast and then also the Department of Consumer Affairs. We could all join together as one voice and tell Comcast once and for all that they are not allowed to treat us the way that they have been and we will not allow it to happen anymore."
1,"You need to train your employees on how to interface with clients. I have had three issues within a month with Comcast workers. Firstly, I got a call from Comcast warning me to order a ""digital converter"" or my TV would no longer work. I ran the video department for Moscone Center, so I know that was not a problem with cable TV using 75ohm coaxial cable signals. But the Comcast employee tried to convince me to order the box, and I said if it was free, you could mail it to me. Obviously, it is not needed and I have not opened the package. Secondly, my channel 3 (NBC) developed an audio problem wherein the audio only broadcast on the right channel and nothing on the left. A technician listened for his self and agreed that it was not something he had ever seen or could fix. He suggested I call for credit starting July 1, 2009 when the problem started. Then he changed the diagnosis in order to charge for a home visit and reported that the problem was my TV monitor instead. Thirdly, now I have crackling sound on Channel 3 NBC, but also, Channel 7 ABC plays background music but there is no dialogue on certain shows. I called to offer sending you a digital capture .mpg movie of the problem. I have made a living troubleshooting AV problems for 40 years, and I have eliminated any problem in my own equipment. When I called today to report the new problem, I spoke with ""Tanisha"" and she was very rude and defensive. She suggested that I did not understand AV equipment and tried to sell me service insurance. So one Comcast employee didn't understand the rabbit-ear versus cable-ready issue but he represented Comcast technical support; another made a home visit, which I was told was free, and then falsified documents contrary to what he told me the actual problem was (and told me to get credit because it was a cable problem); and now, a third employee told me that I would be charged again if the technician returns to look at the same problem. I am paid much more than your service people, because I troubleshoot all the major convention video engineering problems at Moscone. I don't like being lied to and being charged for inadequate service. You need to train your people on how to deal with the public. I have already tested your cable signal on various TV monitors, and it is not an SAP setting adjustment. Your technician came here and agreed with me but then filled out paperwork saying it was my equipment causing the audio problems. Our homeowner association is discussing this issue with other neighborhood groups, and we are switching to Dish DirecTV."
1,"I subscribed to Comcast at $64.06/month. This monthly charge has consistently increased over the years although the quality of channels offered has not. What I am complaining about more than the channel offerings is that Comcast devotes a large chunk of channels to infomercials between either 11:30PM or midnight, up to 7AM the following day. I have complained directly to them about why since beginning of July, they have extended the infomercial time slot through 7AM on a channel I used to be able to watch beginning at 6AM prior.The Comcast rep told me that I must go in person to the local Comcast office and place my complaint since it's a local issue. This is unacceptable to me and solves nothing. In my opinion, the Comcast rep could have forwarded my email complaint to the local office. But the main issue is how could Comcast get away with occupying so many channels with infomercials? I and other clients are paying for the ability to watch these channels and it's not fair that Comcast derives profits from the infomercials while we are at the mercy of Comcast as to when and what we can watch. Thank you."
1,"The appointment with Comcast to repair my cable access was scheduled from 2pm to 4pm on 7/23/2009. Comcast did not show up, so at 4:10pm I called to find out why. It took quite awhile to get an answer, but they eventually said the tech called at 3:30pm. I learned that my appointment was now canceled because I did not answer the tech's call at 3:30pm. I wasted 2 hours off work waiting on Comcast. And they never did show up. Poor tech service and even bad to worse customer service. I would not recommend Comcast to anyone."
1,"We upgraded our program to the next highest level of channels. The sound when commercials are on is deliberately increased, and on multiple channels not just one offender. This happens every day, and especially late at night. They have disturbed our sleep on several occasions, woke us up on at least one dozen occasions. I believe this is an invasion of privacy, and they should be stopped. "
1,"In May of 2008, we moved into our new home in League City, TX. Money being tight due to the move, we opted for the Comcast economy package. The economy package consisted of a digital phone, basic cable, and cable internet. The entire package was to cost $79.99 a month. We signed up for the service and the Comcast contractors installed the necessary equipment in a timely manner.The cable television and phone worked as described; however, a test of the internet connection by several online speed tests revealed that the internet connection was lower than a dial up modem - less than 23 k. I contacted Comcast who, in turn, scheduled a contractor to come and diagnose the problem. A week later, a tech came out, dug around, stated that he found the problem, fixed it and left the location. After he left, I ran the speed test and found that the speed as the exact thing, 23k. I contacted Comcast minutes after their contractor left, and was informed that the contractor would not be sent back to our home, and that we would be put back on the bottom of the list waiting for another contractor to pick up the job. No biggie. About another week passed and another contractor showed up and went through his procedure and said that the signal coming into the house was weak, that he would notify Comcast that they needed an external cable repaired and he left. Two weeks passed and I called in regards to the matter. I was informed by a nice lady on the phone that the cables had been checked, that they were deemed serviceable, and that I had subscribed the economy package, hence the reason for the 23k signal. I informed the customer service rep that had I known that, I would have never signed up for the service. I did not believe that 23k is anywhere near reasonable for a digital cable internet speed. I recognized the statement for what it was, an excuse, and decided to terminate my service. Lesson learned.I packed up the electronics and headed to my local Comcast store, waited in line to turn in my equipment, and finally made it to the clerk. I told the clerk that I wanted to terminate my service. I was given a bill for the month of service, and three trouble fees of $25 each. Of course, I inquired about the trouble fee for attempting to fix their own problem to no avail, but I got the blank stare. I learned a lesson for $150+, so please feel free to take advantage of the lesson that I have learned. It's bought and paid for."
1,"I received a letter on 7/17/09 stating, ""Our records indicate you are currently receiving full access to Comcast's On Demand service which extends beyond the scope of what your Cable TV subscription allows. As a Standard with Premium customer, you will no longer have full access to On Demand effective August 25, 2009."" It then states they have a ""variety of package options available to choose from."" The bottom of the letter offers an ""Upgrade to Digital Preferred package"" at an unspecified cost. Our present package is called ""Digital Premier"" There are no specifics anywhere. What are we getting that we're not supposed to? Why the change now after 3 years as a subscriber at $179.56 per month.I called the 800 number, spoke with ""Randell"". She stated we were only the 2nd customer to call on this. I asked her the above questions. She said she had no answer. I pressed the issue, asking, ""How can you take away something without saying what it is? You must know what you are going to remove."" She put me on hold to talk to her supervisor. She came back on to say ""We think it may be Howard Stern."" As rude as it may sound, I had to laugh. ""Please take him - but I can't believe what you're saying"". She said they were just guessing and no one knew what the letter was about.Comcast has a cable monopoly here in Stockton. We cannot get satellite as we are in an apartment complex and trees block access. I firmly believe that we are targeted for this as the letter we got was addressed to Philip ** or current resident. Our account is in my name and has been for over 3 years. Why the ""or current resident""?"
1,"Misleading to sign-up for a new service  I was promised certain channels after specifically asking and confirming for those. And when I signed up for the service, I did not get them. Customer service after that was horrible, extremely rude."
1,"I had the three services for Comcast cable, phone and internet. We did have a service for four (4) days from 7/14 till today, and we don’t know till how long. The problem is that we signed contract with them, it will end on 2/10. I think this way they can impeach the contract and we can stop the service because there is no service right now. They want to charge us $150 to stop the service. We need your help, you can check with Comcast. Thank you."
1,"Both my wife and I moved on June 04, 2009 due to us serving a lady whom lived below us with an order of protection and the landlord gave us a notice to quit when she was served and we lived there for three years. Now, it just so happens that the lady works as a dispatcher for Comcast Cable. Both my wife and I are on disability and so when we went to Comcast the beginning of June 2009, we asked for a lower rate for our phone, internet, and cable.They refused to lift a hand to give us a cheaper rate or package. My wife and I then received a flyer from Comcast saying that we could get all 3 services for $99.00 a month for two years. They docked on till we are where we are now. And still they have yet to tell us what our bill is for July 2009. However, they want us to sign a two-year contract online and we have been Comcast customers for three years now. We will not sign the contract till they tell us what our bill will be. With this special package, they say that you receive $100.00 cash back and yet they beat around the bush and refuse to work with us. There are a lot of games going on. And then we also noticed that there has been an illegal tap on our phone line and we have a right to know why and they will not tell us why.The Jeff ** claim to have done an internal investigation into us, having a restraining order on one of their employees; however, they treated us terribly and he really made accusations and really it was not right. He even accused us of making a scene when we paid our bill and we made no scene whatsoever. Now, they are trying to cover all this up. We have rights and the games that these men are playing, well, it is just not right. What part of fixed income are these people at Comcast not hearing? We just want something done about this. And the illegal wire-tap my wife has been going through and now me, through a stalking ex-husband, and it has been going on for years now. What can we do about all this? For I know that we have rights! Thank you for your time."
1,"On the Comcast TV website, they list basic cable with list of channels you would receive. I subscribed to that now and do not get the channels they listed. I called customer service and they changed the channels listed, but for $14.30 a month, you can get a long list of channels. Now, you cannot buy that service unless you upgrade to the digital service for $29.99 for 6 months, then $59.99 after that! It's false and misleading advertising!"
1,"I haven't been able to watch the free shows that are on demand since I had the cable. I like to watch certain programs when I'm at my boyfriend's house or my mother's because it seems it's the only way I can watch it. I am tired of not being able to watch it at my own place! I called a number of times and tried to do some process over the phone to update my box and nothing gets fixed. I am never really home since I work full time and have a son. We constantly have a number of things to do after I get off work. I took the time to make an appointment so someone could come out and fix the problem. My appointment was on Sunday, 07/12, at 4 to 6 and I even received a phone call from a representative confirming that I would be home. I called at 5:45 p.m. because I didn't see anyone arrive and they said the person had just left their last job and were on their way. The technician never showed up! I then called and spoke to other representatives on the phone and they said the worker came out and fixed the problem. I'm sorry but I have to say that is **! The tech has to be some lazy irresponsible lying worker who should not work if he doesn't like his job. I don't see how he showed up and fixed the problem and didn't take the time to come to my apartment and see if he really fixed the problem. I don't know if that's how you guys run your business? I hope you guys can assist me when fixing my issue because I'm really at the point where I am going to another cable company. I don't want to but it seems I have no other choice since all I'm getting is the runaround. Your employees are not doing their job. The techs are lying and saying they came out to an appointment and don't do it. They probably go home because they sure don't come out to see their clients. I am very upset because I don't like to deal with issues as little at this that turn as big like this one. When I take time from my work to file a complaint like this, something is wrong and I believe a customer shouldn't have to go this far."
1,"Comcast has consistently stopped working in neighborhood. They also have technical problems and expect me, their customer, to wait hours for a solution. They can never give me a time frame of when it will be fixed. I am always told, ""We'll get to it when we can."" What kind of response is that?! It tends to happen when I have homework or a term paper due online. Even right now, it was down for 20 minutes and that made me turn in my homework 20 minutes late. This is absolutely unacceptable. I mean I can understand once or twice, but this is a constant problem. Comcast needs to get their act together."
1,"I put a call into Comcast on July 9, 2009 after I heard my 6-month old kitten scratching behind my living room chair. When I looked, he had pulled out the extra cable the technician left, at my request, for me to use when I got the containers in the room in its proper places in my apartment and set up my living room the way I want it. I had just moved to a new apartment in the same building I lived in. I asked him to roll it up and put it behind the entertainment center so the kitten doesn't get tangled up in it and choke or get hurt. I told the rep to tell the technician that there is no phone number to call me and just to come out, I will be waiting for him. At 6:15PM, I called to see what happened to him, that he did not come out. The answer, ""He called and got no answer, so he did not go out."" This goes on every time I call for any reason, like in April 2009 telling them the day I will be moving to transfer my account to the new apartment. What did they do? They sent a guy out to pick up my modem. That is how I found out that my internet was cancelled, but not by me. I told them to turn it on again and do not charge me for the reconnect, that I did not tell them to disconnect. Also, to send someone out to put the cable for the internet from the living room to the back bedroom. They did that with no problems.I have no phone and use a neighbor's. She is constantly called by Comcast to speak to me and she tells them that I do not have a phone and only use her phone when I need it. She also told Comcast to stop calling her about my service. They refused because if they called me on July 10 and got no answer, it was because they called her. Tell Comcast to remove any phone number from my account and that they are not to call any number I call from because I am now going to go to a pay phone and call them."
1,"The appointment with Comcast to repair my internet access was scheduled from 8-11 am on 7/12/2009. Comcast did not show up, so at 11:00, I called to find out why. And it took quite awhile to get an answer, but they eventually said the tech would be there soon. While I was talking with Comcast, the tech called at 11:07 followed by a call from the dispatcher at 11:11 and these two messages were routed to my voicemail. When I hung up with Comcast at about 11:15 and listened to the dispatchers message, I learned that my appointment was now canceled because I did not answer the tech's call at 11:07.For the next six hours, from 11:00 to 5:00, I repeatedly called Comcast to explain that I didn't answer the 11:07 call because I was talking to them about their missed appointment. I was told many things (the tech will call you back; you're next on the list; the dispatched will call in 15 to 30 minutes; he'll be there in 1/2 hour; a supervisor will call; he'll definitely be there before the end of the day), all of which turned out to be false. I wasted nine hours on a beautiful summer Sunday afternoon waiting on Comcast. And they never did show up."
1,"Comcast are liars. I've been lied to twice about promotions I was getting. The first, I had a promotion for 12 months and for some reason, they ended it in 10. When I talked to multiple customer service people, they had no idea why someone would stop the promotion after 10 months, but could never help me so I canceled. About a year later, I joined again. I spoke to and chatted with (and even saved the transcript) multiple people at Comcast who assured me if I kept Comcast, I would be able to get my promotions back. After chatting and talking with someone today, they would not give me the promotion even though I told them verbatim what was said to me in the chat. I've tried to get agreements from them in writing but they won't send you anything because their whole company is ran on lies to their customers. If they send you something in writing, they might have to actually stick to the agreement! But try canceling something while you have an agreement with them and you will get penalized!"
1,"We bit on the intro offer of digital phone service. We received a call at 9.30 AM, Friday, July 3, saying they would be at our residence in 15 minutes (Notice: no advanced notice they were coming). The installation was to take 45 minutes. After 3 hours and 30 minutes with two technicians, we told them to leave. We had very limited phone service when they left. (1 and 1/2 phones working). Oh, and by the way, we couldn't use our security system that goes through the phone system. Not long after that, we had no land line phone service (By the way, the technicians switched some of the wiring in the house and dropped at least three previously working telephones).Calls on Monday, July 6, said we would get a call to schedule service, never mind, we were out of land line service. Tuesday, brought a round of discussion with a live-on-line chat. We got a ticket number, and found out we needed to teach the Comcast representative how to use English. There’s still no call and still no action. Tuesday evening, we called, rank and file said the next open work slot was Friday, 10-12, one full week after the start of this debacle.Trying a different number at Comcast, we talked to rank and file and got the same stories, ""our records show you have service, and this is not an out of service situation."" We demanded an escalation. 3 and 1/2 minutes later, we got to talk to a management member (of video services, when we were working on a voice problem). Video said they would send the request to scheduling, to get us on the schedule for Wednesday. The manager mentioned some credits - well at least we have a manager phone number.There is a rule of fives, or rule of sevens in business: it takes X minutes to get new business, X minutes to keep business, X seconds to lose a customer, and X years to get a customer back. I cannot believe the hoops we are being put through. I cannot believe the lack of support we received. I can suggest that any new business be tightly watch and performance measurements be built in before switching to Comcast Voice.Well, we have video and internet also, this died last month - my, my, it was a failed (fried) connection in the road side service box. We didn't see the credit there. Isn't it lovely to spend money on Shack and Stein, but not take care of customers? Beware."
1,"I have tried to set up Internet with Comcast for more than a week now. They are insisting that they need to send someone out to the high-rise I live in, in order to restart the service. However, when I had first moved to the area (and into the same building) the service was started over the phone since I had a Comcast modem and router already. Amazing how 6 months later, I can't find 1 competent customer service person to put in the request to restart the service. They have given me 4 different dates to start the service and yet 1 week later, I still don't have service.I have spent 3 hours on the phone with them and was told that the manager, Forest **, is in an all day meeting and has no replacement. Unfortunately, in the neighborhood that I live in Atlanta, GA, there is no alternative internet service provider, either Comcast or no internet. Furthermore, the consumer protection agency in GA is largely nonexistent and they won't process the complaints they've been receiving regarding Comcast."
1,"We recently subscribed to the next higher step of programs through Comcast cable service. What is extremely annoying is that the channels they provide purposely turns up the volume on commercials. They are doing this purposely, as the sound will definitely increase once the commercial has started. As far as I'm concerned, this is a flagrant act of invasion of privacy. I haven't confronted Comcast about the problem yet, but I can almost guarantee that they will have some excuse for not being able to do anything about it."
1,"I contracted Comcast for the price of $29.99 a month, going up after the end of July. The package I got is a series of paid programs and repletion of the same movies, if any. My TV is 6-month-old, and it has HD installed. Nevertheless, in the last two weeks when I change channels, it is very slow and time-consuming. I am planning to cancel my membership on Monday and use a converter box to get more channels. I know for a fact that a lot of people have returned their boxes and cancelled Comcast. This corporation is greedy and misleads the customers like me."
1,"My Comcast May and June monthly billing statement both has $0.00 balance instead of credit of $50.84. Payment received is equal to $0 instead of $50.00 payments. New charge is $0 and there’s no payment due. When I called Comcast to request billing statements with my monthly charges, previous balance and payments, I was told by a Monica that Comcast will not provide such statements, but instead to log in online to check my account balances. Possible fraud - Comcast may not be presenting the full balance of my account. For example, Comcast can easily turn my credit balance into balance. Further, by not listing monthly charges, I may be overcharged for their services."
1,"Comcast offered a great deal to switch my TV programming from DirecTV to Comcast Digital Cable. When they signed me up, we chose Digital Starter pack with 40 HD channels that included CNN HD and PLD HD, among others. Little that we realize that their service and equipment would be extremely pathetic. They set us up with an HD box with DVR that would literally hang at least 4-5 times a day and would need cold boot every time. Today, 6/29/09, we decided to lug the bulky box to the local Comcast service station in Fremont and got a replacement. When we set up the replacement box today, we no longer received the HD programming line-up that was promised to us as part of the Digital Starter pack (which we locked for one year through a contract, by the way). When I got on the phone and waited for 20 minutes, I gave up and got on a chat session instead. The chat session support person named Ronald told us that I will have to upgrade my package in order to get the HD programs that I until a couple of hours ago (i.e. before exchanging my cable box, which was due to Comcast's bad equipment and not due to our volition) we were receiving. The service support person would be of no help in restoring our programming and directed us back to a 1-800 number to again go through the ordeal. This has resulted in extreme frustration, mental agony and pain. Comcast charges us for the services and then decides to change terms without letting us know. And if a consumer does that, they will slap us with large fees for ""violating the contract.” This is totally unacceptable. In my profession, I have to rely on business and other world news. I had to miss all that because I spent hours trying to resolve a situation that was a result of bad and unethical practice of Comcast. It is tough to quantify the economic implications of such deeds of large corporations."
1,"I have been a customer with Comcast for over a year. On June 12, 2009, I found out that there was a notice put on my account by the inner office that will no longer allow me to make payment arrangements. No one could tell me why. All payment arrangements that I have made were honored and paid in full. Therefore, $116.00 was paid on June 13, 2009. To add injury to insult, my service was disconnected on June 26, 2009 without any notice. I was told by a customer service representative that I needed to pay my past due amount by the end of the day on June 26 or a technician would be out the next day to disconnect my service, which in turn could require me to pay a reconnection fee and the entire bill! Of course, I scrambled to make the payment of $129.00 before this predicament occurred knowing that I just made a payment two weeks prior without receiving a bill! The end total that I paid to Comcast for the month of June was $244.00! I would like to inquire why I can no longer make payment arrangements on my account. Is that policy? Comcast has a reputation for poor customer service and unfortunately I have been a victim of that. The economic damage resulted in me paying $244.00 with the course of two weeks. Customer service representatives were threatening to disconnect my service completely if I did not pay the amount due that same day! I have never been late on any payments or payment arrangements that I have set up!"
1,"First of all, terrible customer service! This has been the worst cable company that we have ever dealt with. The service comes and goes but mostly goes. When you call (after holding for 30+ min), the representative still cannot resolve the problem over the phone and a service call has to be scheduled which can take up to 1 week. Even after the serviceman comes to fix the problem the next day, it can start all over again. Meanwhile, my bill is never credited as promised and Comcast representative will have no notes from your previous call. The price is said to be cheaper but it should be free since you have so many issues and they are so frequent. Terrible, terrible service as well as customer service! Pay more and go with another company! At least this way, you get to watch TV. I say when my service is interrupted then the monthly bill should be on the company, not the consumer. This causes much undue stress and anger! I don't want to hear ""I'm sorry"" from the company anymore. Fix the problem once and for all!  "
1,"Approximately three to four weeks ago, I switched from AT&T to Comcast phone. Since then, the phones, TV and the Internet go in and out or do not work. I have spent four days at home for Comcast to fix their problem, and they will be here tomorrow. Great. I am tired of the Comcast reps saying they are sorry. All of them are sorry. How do you think I feel now that the problems are never fixed?"
1,"With Comcast, the issue is always the same. Something is wrong with service or something has been billed incorrectly and as a customer, I have to call customer service to let them know (I know the number by heart). But when I call customer service, they make me feel as though I've done something wrong in calling them. Today, it was because I didn't press the right number for the correct department. Only trouble is today, for example, I didn't get options when I called. My only options was to complete a customer service survey. After being on hold, the service person wanted to just transfer me around again. This is part for the course with Comcast! Whenever I ask to speak to a supervisor, one is never ever available. I ask for a call back from a supervisor that absolutely has never come in the past. Something just has to be done about customer service. Right now, in my opinion, it is an absolute disservice and it just makes my blood boil to have to contact Comcast. It is like it is completely forgotten that I pay an unreasonable amount of money for cable/internet service, yet when there is a problem, I am the one that has to jump through all the hoops to make it work. I waste valuable time trying to get customer service to help. We go to school online and when the internet is down . . . need I say more? Comcast is the only fast internet available in my particular area. So for now, I'm stuck. Just let one other option become available and I'm out of there!"
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for 6 years and have had numerous problems. Most recently, Comcast opened up a second account in my name and sent me two bills a month for several months for the same service. After calling every month for several months and having agents tell me I owed money on both accounts, it was resolved by an agent who stated that she would put me on a promotion of $55/month before taxes because of my troubles.This month, I received a bill of over $360 retroactively charging me for internet. The customer service agents claimed I was not charged for internet and my bill should have been billed about $85/month. They claimed my promotion would have only saved me $10/month, which is not a substantial benefit to me, and for such a large corporation as Comcast, it is definitely not a large loss. However, $300 of retroactive charges is a substantial loss to me and a minuscule benefit to Comcast. I want a full credit for these retroactive charges. I was told my bill would be $55. And if I knew my bill would still have been $85 with the promotion, I would have immediately switched to another service provider.Therefore, retroactively billing me is inappropriate, because it is against your agent's representation and Comcast would not have received that money at all had I known I was still going to be charged so much for the service. The customer service agents I've talked to said they don't have the power to fix this. Comcast needs to start spending far less money on their commercials and much, much, much more money improving the accuracy and efficiency of their billing, getting more qualified customer service agents, and improving the quality of their services. And why not give something back to customers by reducing the ridiculously high rates. In the meantime, I'm leaving Comcast ASAP. They've lost yet another customer because of their deficiencies."
1,"We paid our Comcast service and 2 days after we paid, we were hit with a late fee. We have severe outages that has killed our TV and had no cable for 1 month and we were still required to pay for service they couldn't fix for over a month and had to buy a new TV as a result of their cable not being grounded. To top it all off, they're the only cable company out here. They won't allow another cable company to come out to my city. As I rent, I am forced to have Comcast if I want to watch TV! I thought that a business can not hold a monopoly on a service in CA so that people could have a choice! But not where I live."
1,"I have moved and had no choice but to take Comcast for my TV services. I would rather choose Direct, but my leasing company would not accommodate my use of the roof for the antenna. I had an initial setup date of 6-17. I received a call on the 13th that my appointment was for the 15. I took the day off and to no avail. Surprise, no one showed up. On the 17th at 6 pm, I had two boxed installed. On the 17th at 9pm, the second box stops working. So I called tech support who could not understand what the issue was. Of course, they gave me another appointment for a time that I would not be able to be home (12 pm to 2 pm). I waited all day on the 18th for someone to come; no one showed. No call either. Today the 19th, I called to schedule someone to come out to the house. They stated that someone showed up on the 18th and there was no answer. That’s not true. We were waiting. Now, I have to drive the non-working box to the nearest Comcast site to exchange the box. Hopefully, a new box will work and it is not some other issue. I was told that I would not be reimbursed for my gas that I now have to use."
1,"I am an ex-customer of Comcast Cable TV. Comcast owes me a credit of $52.33 (paid on 2-23-2009) that they refuse to refund to me. I have contacted them numerous times over several months to no avail. They agree I have a credit but refuse to refund it. They asked me to fax them the bank statement proving I sent the payment by Bill Pay. I faxed the bank statement and they told me that they lost it. I faxed it to them 3 times. I think I am getting the ""run-around"". Obviously, this Corporate Giant has no interest in being fair to ex-customers or they are just incompetent and uncaring. "
1,"My cable TV and high-speed internet goes out daily. Outages have not been uncommon in the past but in the last few months the service has really declined. When it is working, I am still not able to purchase on-demand movies most of the time. Comcast's Atlanta customer service center insists that they can only investigate the problem from inside my house, because of the sporadic nature of the issues. But it never seems to go out when they are at my house. But I still booked meetings with them anyway. The fact that it is working when they show up does not stop them from saying they fixed the problems. I think they get evaluated on the number of tickets they close, not on the number of customers they have satisfied. My job does not allow me to sit around the house every time they can schedule a technician for a visit. And because of the repeated complaints from my neighbors, I know this is not just an issue with my house. When I complained to a supervisor in the Atlanta office, John P., I was told that they do not require me to take time off of work because they have technicians that work nights and weekends. But when I asked him to book a weekend appointment for me, he said they were booked weeks out. He also said he is not aware of other complaints. Did he really check? In the past, they received so many complaints from my street that they cancelled the individual service appointment that I had set up and did something at the local switch. That fix lasted about a week.The entire situation is a joke. There is obviously a problem impacting a street full of professionals that do not have the time to play Comcast's ""it is not us, it must be you"" game. I have worked in technology for 20 years and know that they can monitor (either automatically or manually) the traffic in my neighborhood and sniff out the problem. To me it is simply that they have sold more services in an area than they can handle.What am I to do? I am supposed to have high-speed internet for my job (I usually drive to the office at night and weekends when I need to, because of the constant outages). I have tried to turn to the regulatory authorities but unlike the power company, there is no single strong commission in my city or state that will punish them for bad service. The customer service department does not seem to care about their customers. I assume that they will continue to provide ** service until U-verse moves into my corner of the city and provides real competition. I am paying about $120 a month for a service that is sporadic, and for customer service that does not seem to understand the scope of the problem."
1,"My internet connection and or my cable TV connection have gone out a total of eight times in the last five weeks. Each time, Comcast has sent out a repair person at their convenience, while I get to change my schedule to accommodate theirs, who temporarily fixed it and have plenty of excuses to explain why it won't happen again. They have included the wiring is old and needs to be replaced. The other techs used a technique called ""boot and scoot"" which was explained to me to mean they just splice in a piece of wire and get out as fast as possible. One tech added an amplifier, another removed the amplifier. Another tech told me the modem was bad so I bought a new one. Then I found out that there wasn't anything wrong with the first one but I can't return a modem once it has been opened because it's an electronic item. Another time they sent out a person to disconnect my neighbor because he switched to a satellite network but disconnected mine instead. The excuses, incompetence and breakdowns keep coming but the reliability does not.When I call in, I'm always, without exception, put on hold. During this time, Comcast has the nerve to play recorded messages telling how I'm a highly valued customer and all about the great shows I could be watching if my connection worked. The best part is they also play commercials telling me about other premium channels and services I can sign up for that won't work either but that I can pay more money each month.I’ve been a customer for over twenty years and yet I get treated like someone whose business they don't need. Maybe that's what I need to do. Three of my neighbors have switched from Comcast to a Dish Network because of their lack of service. I think I will be next but not before I write an editorial to my local newspaper, the college newspaper where I work, the Better Business Bureau, The County Cable Franchise Commission and I purchase a full page of space in the newspaper as well just to make sure everybody gets to see this. I also intend to post this message on any and every internet site that might have an interest in it. I will also look into any state offices that might have an interest in your incompetent performance.Here's a surprise! While writing this, my cable connection dropped out again. That brings the count up to nine times in five weeks. "
1,"When I moved to Jacksonville, Florida for a job, Comcast was the only cable provider. When I signed up, I was not given a modem. Instead, they directed me to a site online where I could order the modem to use. I paid almost $100.00 for the modem. I moved from Jacksonville, Florida in February 2009. Since that time, Comcast has tried to schedule appointments with me twice to pick up the modem that I purchased. They have tried twice now and I informed them not to call me anymore. I wonder how many people have purchased a modem and then give it to Comcast. I believe this is a deliberate scam to acquire free modems to rent to new customers."
1,"I just moved to the Frederick area. Since 2001, I have had access to NASA TV since I am a space buff through Dish Network, a local cable company back in Minnesota where I used to live, and DirecTV. I have contacted Comcast multiple times and have got mixed responses. I have been told there are plans in the works, no plans at all, it will be added this year, and just today no information.I am getting very, very upset that a national company won't carry a free channel and will carry foreign channels. I have looked at other cities that have Comcast and some of them have it. Why won't Comcast add it to the lineup of channels in the state of Maryland, which has a NASA center, is anyone's guess?Also, a lot of the time I get a tiling screen or the picture freezes along with audio or the audio won't be there. Also, Comcast doesn't have the HD channels as they claim to have. By my count, not including the local channels, there are 32 HD channels, not near the number they say they do. I have had better experience with Satellite in terms of cost, quality of customer service, variety of channels, basically everything! I laugh at Comcast!"
1,"Starting in March 2009, a one-time charge of $40 showed up on our Comcast bill for unreturned equipment. No other explanation was given so I called Comcast. They said it was for a modem they couldn't find which should have been picked up during a service call that had occurred one year before. This was the first time we had heard that a modem was missing and we informed them that we didn't have it and had no reason to keep it since the technician had replaced the old modem with a new one that handled phone service as well.We also explained that it seemed odd to be notified about missing equipment a year after the technician made their visit. They agreed and told us not to pay the $40 and that they would take care of it on their end. Every month since, the charge has continued to show up on my bill. Every month, I call and again they tell me they're sending the forms to get it removed. This has been going on for three months now and I feel they're stonewalling me to get me to pay the fee. If they come back and say they still can't find the equipment I'm not sure what recourse I have. What particularly bothers me about this incident is that the charge showed up without explanation and a year after the supposed incident occurred. I'm sure many customers just pay the fee. When I asked about the bill, one of the telephone representatives acknowledged, ""Oh yeah, we add that so people will call in."" Really? Is this a best practice?"
1,"I had the triple play service; phone, internet, and TV. I had trouble from day one when I paid $90 to have service connected. Two televisions did not even have the wire needed to hook to the cable. Three outlets were either missing or not screwed in. The cable was laying on the ground in front of my house. To this day I have a cable with two splitters running across my front porch. Comcast told me to be careful that it wasn't kicked. I had to contact Comcast seven times in under one year because service went out. I was told by a supervisor that they would refund the days I was unable to use the phone and other services. She also told me they would fix the installation. None of this ever happened. In fact, because it was a holiday weekend, my daughter who had just gotten home with a newborn baby the day before was home alone with no phone or transportation.This supervisor had been informed of this but insisted I would have to wait several days to get the phone working. I have now canceled the phone service. The next problem I have will go to the authorities of my city as I have documented it all. I have had cable with several companies of many years with no problems. Comcast has the worst installation, equipment and by far the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with."
1,"I cancelled my Comcast service on 1/26/2009 by returning the equipment to Comcast office here and was told by the lady at the office that the service was officially cancelled as of that date. However, I kept getting bills from Comcast for the next two months. A telephone call revealed that the billing department was unaware of the service being cancelled! Anyway, the customer service representative assured me that the account will be updated to reflect the cancellation and the credit in my account ($90 something) will be refunded shortly. Even after several months waiting and three calls to Comcast, no refund showed up. Finally, on May 24th, I filled out a complaint on their website, supposedly to be looked into by one Rick **, their VP for Customer Relations. Next day, I received a telephone call from Comcast as a follow-up to my e-mail complaint and I was assured by the man that the refund check will be mailed out most definitely by the end of the month. Guess what, there is no check as of today. This is what one gets for paying everyone of their bills on time and being a good customer for six years! What an ungrateful company. I am glad I switched over to FIOS. Anyway, I have also filed a complaint with the Maryland Attorney general's office."
1,"I have had nothing but problems since Comcast took over the cable company in my area. They are always down and service is next to garbage! Bring back Road Runner. There was never a problem with them and the prices were much better. Your cost is too much, service is crap."
1,"Comcast is forcing us to add cable boxes to all the TVs in our house.  Currently, our channels go to number 78.  In a few months, basic cable will be limited to channel 27 and below.  What a rip off!  We have TVs in our kid's rooms where they watch shows on channels 62, 63 and 64.  Now, my options are 1) throw away the TVs or 2) pay something like $11 a month for each additional TV (cable box rental plus ""outlet fee"").  I will switch to AT&T as soon as they get the fiber cables run so I can get TV at my house."
1,"I called Comcast to see why one of my cable boxes was not powering on. I was told that it has probably ""fried"" and that they would send out a technician with a new box at no service charge to me. Since the technician was anyway coming out to my place, I requested that they send an HD box as a replacement and not the basic box. Apparently, that is not possible, unless I agree to pay a fee of $15+. However, I could go to the Comcast Service Center and pick it and not have to pay the $15+. I asked why. Apparently, the $15+ covers the gas, etc., that would be incurred by Comcast. That does not make sense. They had already agreed to come out to my place (which would have cost them gas money). So what was the big deal about coming out with an HD box instead of a basic box. They just would not do it. They kept insisting that I should pay for the change of the box if they would bring it out. Finally, I just got fed up with them and told them to send the basic box itself. It's their loss; they would not be making the extra on the HD service every month, in front of which the $15+ is nothing."
1,"Comcast told everybody that we do not have to worry about the change in digital TV mandated by the government. No, we receive a letter saying all TVs need a cable box to receive Comcast TV. This is their box, not the converter. Why do they tell us one thing and change in the future."
1,"I'm at my mother's house recovering from surgery. We lost cable, phone, and Internet last night at 10pm. They fixed the phone and cable. I got the Internet to work after 4 hours on the phone around 7am. It died before 6pm. I dealt with numerous rude sickos for 4 hours only to have them blame the problem on Vista, even though I never had problems until they started jacking with my settings.They refuse to put my mother's correct SS# on her account and they abuse her every time she has to call over that. They kept confusing us with another account, and telling us that it worked or that we didn't have wi-fi, like we're a couple of brain-damaged 5 year-olds. It worked for two hours, then died again. After being uncommonly evil, they told us that they couldn't get a tech guy out here for 86 hours. This is terrible.If it were their intention to be the worst, most evil, incompetent, sadistic company on this planet I can't think of a single thing they would be doing differently. Since they confused my mother's account with mine in another town (I'm here recovering from surgery) and they jacked with all my settings for 7 hours I know that when I get back home nothing will work there, either. So 8 hours on the phone with these psychopaths and everything is worse than when I first called. This is the 4th of the last 7 days that the Internet has gone out, and it will be another 4 before they get out here"
1,"I paid a bill over the internet, and they lost the payment somehow, even though my bank statements clearly show that they deducted the money. I have called the regional office on innumerable times. I have called the national hotline multiple times, and they have told me they could not help me. I have faxed proof of payment 3 times and emailed them once. I have spoken to my bank, and I've had my service disconnected 2 times. This has been going on since March. Comcast doesn't really care and just wants me to pay again. They have really been incompetent and non-existent in this matter. I smell a lawsuit coming."
1,"The Comcast guy rang my intercom, then proceeded to announce my name, my bill amount for service, etc. I told him stop and I would come downstairs. He then informed me my bill was ""too high"" and he was here to reduce it. I said I was skeptical. He announced my bill would be reduced from $162.20 a month to $119.00 a month if I let them upgrade my package, including a phone line I do not want. Thirty minutes later, he returned claiming I only qualified for the $149 a month because of my ""circumstance"". They came two days later and installed their new equipment. Today, I received the bill: $246.69, not to mention a $5.70 charge for a 911 call. When I called the center, it says wait for your call to be answered, then hangs up. I tried the live chat, who told me I have to talk to someone to ""reduce my services"" in order to lower my bill, which is now almost double where it was before they came to my door. I am in poor physical health, including a bad heart with mitral valve leakage. I can not handle stress. I have been unable to resolve this issue on the phone or online with them and each encounter leaves me so sick I vomit and am unable to eat or even watch the television or use the internet I pay so much for. I also have a witness to all the aforementioned events and I am willing to file suit if it be necessary."
1,"I can no longer receive Channel 20. The screen informs me that this is a weak or no signal. This is a PBS station; I receive Channel 21 and 11. I contacted Comcast customer service and was told they would send a technician and if it was my problem they would charge me. I could avoid the technician fee if I pay $1.49/monthly. A postcard sent by Comcast informs me WYCC (PBS) will change to be digitally delivered on Basic Service channel 20 and will require a digital receiver or compatible equipment. I purchased a digital TV last year to avoid the need for a converter. I usually watch Channel 20 for quality entertainment and intelligent news coverage, i.e, Charlie Rose. I do not know what to do now."
1,"   I am an IT professional who is very proficient in Computers and Networking.  I fully understand how this stuff works.  That's why I cannot understand why comcast is so flaky lately.  Their customer service is horrible, but usually I never have to be bothered with interacting with that bunch. Comcast has been pretty good.  I have been a customer for 6+ years, only subscribing to the basic cable internet service for +/-$40 a month.  I noticed about 2 months ago the service was becoming more and more intermittent.  Basically I lose all connection to the internet.  Sometimes the modem does this slow blinking thing that resembles a modem firmware upgrade or ip reconfiguration.  Sometimes the modem looks like it is operating normally, but it cannot connect to any remote server. I would go on and on about my nightmare experiences with the customer service clowns and the ""support techs"", but is gives me a headache just thinking about it.  Plus I know that it is just a big charade that is put on to portray competence and give us the feeling that ""somebody is working on my issue"".  Basically, they need to fix their problems before I decide to go with the less expensive and seemingly more stable DSL solution. What irritates me is that they have the $ to fix it, but they are unwilling or unable to fix it.\ Basically, they need to fix their problems before I decide to go with the less expensive and seemingly more stable DSL solution.

1," They have made it clear, customer service is not a priority. They have also made it clear Comacast can not handle repairs timely or satisfactorily. It has been five days and we still have no clear understanding as to this company is doing to resolve this problem. We have a list of names and history if it would be any help to you. "
1,   Comcast Cable is awful.  Since May 22 wire has been unburied exposed wrapped around our home in Evergrene with no date to bury the eye sore and safety hazard with 4 small kids in our home until June 12.  The Comcast representative that drapped the wire on May 22 had told us he would be out the next week to bury the wire.  I have spoken over 8 times to request burial with the Comcast representatives being uncooperative.  22 days for incomplete work to be completed and leave expose wiring above grown is both unreasonable and unsafe!  Comcast was unwilling to provide an earlier date to bury. I am concerned for my 4 small children as this wire is around their playground and the parameter of our property. Please help. 
1,"      Over a month ago, I requested a bundling of my services (cable, home phone, & internet).  At the time of the request, I was told that my original telephone number could be ""ported"" from ATT.  The installation took place on 4/29/09.  I was told at the time of the installation that the porting would take place in 5 - 7 days.  After 7 days, I contacted Comcast to see the status.  I was told then that the request for ""porting"" the number had not been made.  I was directed to a 3rd party to verify that I wanted the number ported. I asked Comcast Customer Service, if I needed to contact AT & T to request the number to be ported.  I was told no.  Another 7 days passed & my phone number had not been ported.  I called Comcast again & was told that the request had not been made.  A second time, I was directed to a 3rd party to verify the porting.  Again, I asked if I needed to contact AT & T to request the number to be ported & was told no.  Another 7 days passed without the number being ported.  A third time I called to see why the number was not ported.  A customer service representative said that I had not requested the number to be ported.  A third time I requested the number to be ported & was directed to a 3rd party to verify.  This time, a representative told me that I did need to call AT & T to tell them to ""let the number go"".  I called AT & T and the representative said that the number was in the process of being ported & it was not necessary for me to request the port through them; that it should be done through a 3rd party.  
In the past month, I have made a dozen phone calls & 2 ""live chats"" with Comcast.  I have spent over 10 hours trying to resolve this issue.  Each representative that I spoke with were unable to rectify this situation.  On Monday, May 25, I was ""promised"" yet again that I would have my number ported in 24 hours.  In addition, I would have a credit of approximately $175 on my account due to the problems that I had encountered.  On 5/28, I checked my account on line & saw that the ""credits"" were actually additions to my bill & I still do not have the service that I was paying for. I have spent over 10 hours of my time dealing with what comcast has admitted as their mistake. I have also been billed $430.81 for service that I have not received. All without resolve to this issue.  Supervisors, whom the representatives insist are the only ones able to rectify this situation are unwilling to speak to me.  It appears that there is a pervasive attitude at Comcast of unwillingness to assist or to take responsiblity for the mistakes of their employees.  There is also a sense that the supervisors are ""above"" talking to customers.  For approxmiately 30 minutes I was on hold for a supervisor & was disconnected.

1,"      I made an appointment to have an additional drop installed and I was also having difficulty with a HD DVR box supplied by Comcast. The appointment window was between 10 and noon. At noon I called and the Tech was running late and he would be at our house by 2:00pm. At 2:30 I called and he was still running late and he would be at our house at 4:00. He arrived just before 4:00 and he stated that he was too big to get into the attic crawl space and that another tech was coming to do the drop. In the mean time he looked at the HD DVR box and replaced it. It was in worse shape than the one he replaced.The new tech showed up and due to the insulation in the attic he refused to do the drop from the attic. So I now have a cable running down the outside of my front entry way. By this time it is 7:30pm and the first tech was going to leave the broken box and that I would have to set up an appointment to have someone else come out and replace it. The new drop also included a HD DVR box. By this time the tech was getting mad and when I stated that the replaced HD DVR box was not acceptable because it was in worse shape then the original. He left my house saying he would be back within the hours. He never came back. We went to set up the new drop because he left without setting the new drop up. What did we find no power cord. This was Saturday of Memorial weekend no cable and no one willing to make it right until next week. Customer service, what a joke, when I called to have the technicial come back all I got was if he said he was coming back he will. He didn't.He never came back.

1,"   I lived in Martinez, Ca. from June of 96 until I moved to Las Vegas on Oct. 21st of 08. I was a single father. I had regular cable from Comcast for years and when contacted again and again to install Digital Cable, I said no, I'm fine. At the end of April of 07' I recieved a mailer for Digital for a time with a deal. I excepted and ordered three boxes with the living room being HD. A day or so later, I recieved a box with three ""boxes"" that looked like modems. I called after looking at them and said, "" I'm sorry, but how do I record on these""?I was told that I couldn't record and that they had sent me the wrong boxes because ""they have a warehouse full of those and they are trying to get them out there"". A Tech arrived the next day and exchanged these ""useless"" modem like boxes for a traditional three boxes. He left and I immediately had viewing problems. After about 5 or 6 more tech visits, a Supervisor came to my house in the country and checked everything. I had cable from around the early 60s or earlier and EVERYTHING had to be replaced ""and that the other techs probably knew that"" and didn't want to mess with it. He was very nice and did it all in about an hour and a half. The next year and a half was great and no serious problems except a bad box that my daughter called to be replaced. No questions about bills, boxes or ANYTHING was ever asked of me and I was never billed for anything. I moved to Vegas and had a tech come to pick up the three traditional boxes I had and was told on the phone that I may have an old Zenith box that was junk. I was never, to my knowledge- charged for it but did find it where my daughter had put it in the hall closet and gave that one to the service tech. He then called in and spoke to the person that I had conversations with about my HD and picture not working and he said to tell me that I had three cable boxes that I owed them. I had no idea what boxes he was refering to, except the ""modem"" style 3 from a year and a half ago. I was hung up on about 10 times while calling for my credit refund from my account. I always tried to pay ahead and had a credit balance of about 56 or 57.00. The City of Martinez had to get involved and I was told that Comcast would ""write them off"". A Comcast lady called to tell me this too and when I asked her about my credit refund, she said she would look into it and get back to me. Well, needless to say, no call back, no refund and I am disabled in Vegas and about to buy an house in Sept or Oct of this year. I haven't been able to check my credit and I can't call them anymore due to the stress of all of this. They know that those modem style boxes probably are usless to anyone other than Comcast and I think that if this isn't just ""get even time"", that the tech is in business for himself. I still want my refund and it is just the principle. I would even donate it to charity, but I want my money.He was very nice and did it all in about an hour and a half.

1,   I've had comcast for a long time and would like to keep it! But getting tired of the way Woodbine customers are being treated!When HD can I kept calling about it and comcast said it's not in Woodbine yet. Now everyone around Woodbine has on deman I call Woodbine don't have it and they don't know when it will get here if ever! Woodbine is small and I guess wouldn't mean that much if comcast lost it as a customer.But please realize that people in Woodbine pay the same amount as everyone around us but we get so much less. Why dose comcast think thats fair? Why are we not kept informed on whats going on around us? 
1,"But on March 23, 2007 I received a call from a technician saying that instead of coming March 27th, he was free that day and asked if it would be alright if he came then instead. I agreed and the Comcast technician came to install the box. Now, I am a very inquisitive person and asked him why I had to have a box. I told him that I understood that as long as there was cable, one did not need the converter box. He told me it was not a converter box but a different kind of box that would give me many channels. I then asked him how long I would have to have the box and when would they come to remove it and he was evasive. He said, ""They'll call you."" When he finished installing the box, he told me to sign that I had received the box and I, in my naivet, signed the form. He did not leave me a copy and he left in a hurry.  I was delighted to have so many channels and asked my neighbors if they had also gotten a box, but none had.  A month went by and then one day I went online to see my credit card statement and print it as I do each month. When I noticed there was a charge for $63.14 from Comcast, instead of the normal fee of $12.56 that I have always paid. (I only purchase the Basic Service.) I called Comcast to question the charge and I was told that I had purchased a new service from a door-to-door Comcast salesperson. I denied this and explained above what I have told you and I was told that I had signed for the service and that they would not remove the charge. (Of course!! That was the form I signed for the technician, thinking I was only signing that the box had been delivered and installed!) I told them I did not order the service and asked they come and remove the box and put my service back the way it was before: to the basic service for $12.56.  After that, I attempted several times to speak to different Comcast customer service reps and none of them wanted to hear what I was saying.  Finally, one day last week I called again and spoke to customer service rep, Reyna, who was very nice, heard me out and said she was sorry for what I was put through. She asked me if I wanted her to tell her Supervisor that I wanted this to be investigated and I said yes.  So I assume it is being investigated. It should be by checking what date the box was installed in my home and the name of the individual who did it. Your records will show who it was.I have figured out what happened. Probably someone in your Company who will either get a commission for selling door-to-door (or must meet a quota) dreamed up the scam of having his girlfriend call the Comcast customers and give them the story I was given and the appointment set up in order not to have to come selling door-to-door. Once the appointment is made, it's a piece of cake, he comes in, installs the box to the unsuspecting customer, makes them sign that they received the box (when they are actually signing a new service order) and makes his commission (or adds to his quota) with no hassles. Comcast is unaware of these unscrupulous people they have hired. The name of the technician who came to my house, when I asked him his name, said his name was Shane or Sean. He is a tall, black fellow. This scam perpetrated against me has caused me anger, indignation and sleepless nights because I feel violated and will write to the City of Plantation and NBC about this.

1," I realize each of these boxes do not pull a great deal of electricity, but when you add up the millions of boxes being plugged in around the Country, I think this is the last thing America needs - more drain on our already fragile electric grid.  Why doesn't Comcast simply send the digital signal through the lines to the houses?  Why do we need converter?  At the very least, why not place one converter where the cable enters the house to avoid multiple boxes at every television?  I wrote to Comcast and no one provided a reason for the multiple boxes.  I spoke with a Comcast representative and he agreed that Comcast has created a great deal of electronic waste and electric draw that is unnecessary.If this was a simple oversight, then I hope Comcast would see the error in their ways and make more ""Green"" solutions.  In this case, at the very least this was a really stupid and wasteful decision.But I do not think they are complete idiots.  I think Comcast Management is greedy.  Comcast would like users to order additional converter boxes for a fee, and have a vested interest in keeping their business with Comcast.  At the expense of our environment and our precious energy supply, Comcast decided to try to make an extra buck.I hope other customers will complain to make Comcast change their strategy."
1,"   comcast CABLE surge blew and fried 3 routers and my modem and a 62"" tv! I replaced all equiptment and had service out and now my internet is slow and freezes all the time .it is just horrible! tv signal is ok I have tried everything w/comcast and get nowhere. comcast has arrainged thier insurance co to pay for tv and equipt. but my service is the pis. WHAT CAN I GET THEM TO DO?"
1,   On 5/12/2009 I called to report that my cable box was not working correctly that it would come in and out and that I know it was the box because I switched the boxes from the other room and it still did it. Just to make sure that it was not the tv or the cable. I spoke with a rep. named Latisha explained to her that I work 6 days a week 10 hour days and that the cable company was just over the hill from my apt. I also explained to her that it would be 6:00 p.m. before I got home she stated that would not be a problem she would noted that on the issue ticket and also for them to call a half hour before they would be coming.She asked me what would be the phone number that I could be reached at and I told her anytime after 5:15 p.m. it would have to be my cell phone. And that anytime before that it would be my work number. She read back all the information to me and it was correct. I thanked her and let her know how much help she was.On 4\13\2009 I come straight home her by 6:00 p.m. I waited and I waited no one ever showed up. So I call again and this time I speak with a lady named Annie I explained to her what was said and that is when she told me it was noted at 5:45 p.m. Access denied. I explained to Annie that it was noted on the issue ticket that I would not be home until 6:00 p.m. she pulled the issue ticket and agreed that is when I said I felt that comcast should have to credit me for this. Annie said I do agree but she was not the one that could do that the Tech. that would be coming out would have to. But for me to tell the Tech. On time garuntee and he would be able to have my bill ajusted. Once again I said I have been through this yesterday with Latisha and she said that they could not make then do what they are asked on the issue ticket. I do not understand that.So she asked me would 6:00 p.m. be ok and I responded that I had already made plains that I would not be home until 7:00 p.m. and she said she would note that on the issue ticket. On 5\15\2009 I got home around 6:58 p.m. and passed the comcast office and seen 4 vans and a bunch of young men stand around. I can see the business from my apartment and they can see me. At 7:15 p.m. I called the 1-800-266-2278 I was very upset to see 2 vans went east and 2 vans went west and passed my apartment by. When I called a rep. named Debbie answered and I explaind what was going on. And she said that she understood and that she could not make them do anything only issue a ticket. I said look I am getting very upset with comcast I have had nothing but problems with them from day one. I also said to her about what I saw and said look I do not get paid to just stand around and do nothing and neither do you.These young men are and it is not right it is not right that I pay someone to just stand there watching and playing around on Comcast customer's money. I also said that maybe I should pay my bill like I am getting my service and explaind to her that I am just getting upset with this. She said she understood why could I not just go to the office I said to her about my hours. And about what Annie had told me about the On time garuntee. She said that was not correct and I said to her that I did not understand are they not all trained the same way and she said yes that some people may miss interpet what is being said. She also said that she didn't know why I was told they could come that late. I explained to her that they could come that late to hook me up but could not come that late just to switch out a box. This is not understandable. I asked Debbie if I may speak to a manager and she asked me to hold. She come back on and ask me what about Sunday? I explained to her that was my only day off and that I was not setting around and waiting for them not to call. I also said they do not work on Sunday and she said yes they did and I told her that I could not promise as they have to me that I could just be home in 30 minutes that I had laundry to do and shopping also. So she put me on hold and tried to call the dispatch and she told her that they did try to call and that at 7:11 p.m. they could not get access to my house. Well Debbie agree's that that was not true when I watched them and called her at 7:15 p.m. She said that she know she had been on the phone with me for at least 45 mins. She asked me again about Sunday and I said no I may not beable to be here in 30 minutes she understood. She put me through to the manager and his name was Chris. That was about a worthless cause he went on and on about no one home on answer. I said to him that I know that they did not call after a while he said that they did try to call me it was noted right there in front of him and I told him I know better and that they lady that put me through to him know I was not lieing now he said that if I could not beable to be reached on Sunday and I said you do not work on Sunday I have never seen a van move from there on Sunday and he said I was right. Again saying the say thing about Sunday if I could not agree with that then there was nothing I could do. I told him that I was contact the better business and he said do what I had to do. So now I am not sure what I need to do but I know my rights as a paying customer and that is to be honest to them as well as them be to me and that I have not received that.  I also said they do not work on Sunday and she said yes they did and I told her that I could not promise as they have to me that I could just be home in 30 minutes that I had laundry to do and shopping also. So she put me on hold and tried to call the dispatch and she told her that they did try to call and that at 7:11 p.m. they could not get access to my house.

1,   comcast was suppost to come to my house ans install the service but the guy they send didnt want to do it.so the excuse he give me was that there was no antenna or connection cables i mean they knew it was a new customer.they were suppost to come at 5 pm too but they didnt show ed up.comcast was not giving me the services for free i was paying for it
1,"   My husband at the time set up all utilities in my name back in April of 2007.  In Sept. 2008, I called the Comcast office on Cobb Pkwy. to cancel the extra service because I could not afford the monthly bills.  I was told to bring in the equipment, which I did the first part of October, 2008.Since then, I have been billed for the 3 cable boxes I had returned.  The company shows that I called and canceled the boxes, but they are showing that I ""picked up"" 3 boxes in October, rather than return them.  I have been charged $5.99 X 3 since I returned the boxes in October.  Nothing is being done.I'm promised that they'll return my call, but they don't. I was told the boxes were active and I told the girl at Comcast to turn them off.  I've spoken to numerous people over the phone and they all say there's nothing they can do, or that they'll look into this and call me.  I'm told I have to go down to the office where I returned the equipment.  I've gone down there and I'm told they can't do anything.  I call again and I'm told that they can look up the receipt.  I go down to the office and I'm told they don't have access to pulling receipts.I do not have any of the cable boxes I've been charged for during the past 8 months.  I've refused to pay the extra charges, and they shut my cable off, only to charge me for the reconnect.  I'm told I can't change my cable or cancel it because my account is on ""hold"".  I can't pay these high bills due to unemployment, and as of now, it's been 8 months of getting nowhere with this horrible company.  When my cable is turned off, I'm lied to, saying it isn't, that there ""must be something wrong and they'll work on it"", but I'm still being charged a re-connect fee.I want what I've been falsely charged for refunded to me and I want either a low rate like I use to have or I want to be allowed to drop this company."
1,My cable service doesny work. I had 3 techs out. The first one didn't show up. The second one was late by a hour. The thrid was late too. The manager showed late. And did some work. But I still have the same problems. The now wont call me back. I'm paying for service Im not getting. I can't watch TV.  
1,"   Have two Comcast accts for 2 locations/accounts coming to primary location and tried to set up 2nd account number for on line bill pay.  Spoke to Comcast Internet assist and was informed Comcast has a known clich in our system that will not allow multiple accts to be paid on line.  Directed me back to 1-800-Comcast bill pay which they charge a service fee if you use the automated system or a higher fee if you use the Customer Svc Rep to make the payment.  Customer Service Rep would not waive the fee and their only reply was you can take the payment to an office or mail it.  This is a Comcast bill pay on line system problem and consumers are paying extra for something offered and made much a do about, but not usable."
1,"   Each complaint is nearly identical.  Comcast, DirectTV and Dish Network have been my research so far. (My own personal struggle has been with Comcast.) I've read each of their sneaky little ""customer agreements"".  I've decided to forego television entirely.  Internet/books/movies can be my at home entertainment.  Solving specific individual complaints cannot solve a thing. Their terms of agreement should be loud and clear, not fuzzy grayed and tiny print. They don't have to be fair or reasonable if they wrote it in tiny print. The contract is for their protection (as if they need it), and not ours.  We have no protection. The most we can do is set into law that they must make their terms OBVIOUS to the consumer BEFORE the product is purchased.  The problem with that is that NOONE WHO READ THEIR AGREEMENT WOULD ACTUALLY PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCT.  Write to congressmen. By purchasing cable/satellite, I'm only purchasing a bunch of stupid channels advertising the topsy-turvey tomato and the Sham-wow anyway.  "
1,"   I made a payment for $100 dollars I have send them the proof of that payment with statement of my bank a letter from a manager from Chase back they took my money they dont want to credit my account. They are stressing me out taking time from my work, shutting off my service every month."
1,"Unfortunately, I had another matter in the home that required my presence at home. I needed to leave work anyway and figured the cable tech would be arriving around 4:50 like they normally do. 
When 4:50 approached and I hadn't received the courtesy call, I decided to call Comcast to make sure my appointment was scheduled still. The representative, Tammy, verified all of the information and said that the tech still had ten minutes to arrive. She provided me a ticket # of and the technician number (Errol M). So, I waited. I called again at 5:10p because the tech still had not arrived.
I spoke to representative #2, Candace who didn't have an ID# but worked in the Silver Spring, MD office with Carleen as her supervisor. She confirmed that the tech was running late and I asked her to verify that he had the correct number, which he did. I requested that the tech contact me via phone to provide me with an ETA. She said that she would note the account and ask that the tech call me directly, which the tech never did.
I called again at 5:50p and spoke with representative #3, Gerald W located in Silver Spring. He noted that the tech acknowledged receipt of the ticket 1203108 and indicated at 5:30p that I was next. I asked Gerald why tech --- did not call to let me know and estimated time of arrival. Gerald said that he was unsure and could ask a supervisor to call him and have the tech contact me with an ETA. He asked to place me on hold. I held for about eight minutes and the call was disconnected.
I called back to complete the inquiry from the previously failed call and spoke to representative #4, Dwayne S located in Largo. He indicated that the tech had left the last job and would be on his way to me in ten minutes. I requested that a supervisor contact me and Dwayne informed me that I would be called in an hour. The supervisor NEVER called.
Because I know that Comcast is NEVER true to the time frames that THEY create, I understand that they will JUST beat the end time for the service call to avoid the $20 credit to the customer. However, my issue (other than him arriving at 6:23p and never apologizing) was that there was never a call to confirm when he would arrive despite my numerous attempts requesting this information. Not to mention that when I first set up the service call on 5/3, I specifically asked for the technician to call me 30 minutes prior so I could leave work to meet them there.When the tech arrived, it took him all of ten minutes to correct the problem. Apparently a different comcast technician accidentally disconnected service to my home instead of another residence. Wow.I'm unsure why Comcast insists on providing substandard service at overcharged prices. What are the other alternatives? I prefer cable over having a huge satellite drilled into my roof. However, Comcast is the only one to service Maryland. I am fed up with Comcast's practices and I would like to see some results regarding this matter that happens over and over and over and over again.

1,"   Comcast advertises fast internet service, but everytime I used there service, it is deadly slow!!!! I think I can even have faster service using dial-ups!"
1,"   A Comcast van sideswiped my parked car on 3/27/2009, and kept on driving. Witnesses saw the accident, and saw the van leave the scene, but did not get the plate number. I filed a police report (report #040557, First District DC Police), and I've been in touch with numerous people at Comcast who give me a run-around.My blog about the problem is here: http://comcast-hitandrun.blogspot.com"
1,"   My husband is home on vacation this week and he is finally getting to see how lousy Comcast is!  I complain to him about it all the time, but he never gets to see it.  The TV is pixeling, the phone doesn't work, all the things I have told him about he is finally getting to see first hand!"
1,I also think it takes long time to go on line.  I am thinking of changing my service to another company.
1,"   The first incident of wrong doing, is when the service technician did not call in advance before he came to my apartment and lied that he showed up, thus not honoring my $20 rebate.  Then, I was lied to by a customer service rep about the time of service.  When I finally received a copy of my order, I see charges for services I didn't order.  I was told to call customer service and was insured the changes were made.  The changes were not made, so my bill was high.  I have been lied to in my several calls to customer service.  It's three months later, and I am still incorrectly billed."
1,"   I have been without internet for 6 days, i called comcast tech support, they say i must have internet, they try reseting modem, this that, but no internet, they schedule a tech to come, so i loose half day waiting the van just passed by and did not call me at all, and just reschedule the appoint for 2 more days, and still not internet, and no ways they can send tech before that time, probably the technitian did not want to do the job, he did not even mind to stop, only drove around 60 miles per hour i ran behind him but even when i call right away to report they were unable to send him back or do it faster. So tech support in comcast is horrible i probably know more than them. In few words comcast techinical service is unprofessional."
1," After talking with several supervisors they told me that their system is infailable and that we watched those movies and will be charged for them. I immediately canceled my service for both cable and internet with them. I have not been able to find a way to talk with anyone higher then the ""supervisors' who wont help me. Is there a way to speak to someone higher up in the corporation? We are being charged $100.00 that we will not pay which means this will affect our credit."
1,"   We have tv cable service with Comcast, in Houston, Texas, and this includes FoxNews channel 38.  For the past month or longer, Channel 38 had been on and off on our tv, and when we call comcast they always tell us that comcast is updating their service, or is having technical problems in our area.  However, for the past 2 days, Channel 38 showed up on our tv on and off, until 5:00 PM (our time), then for the whole evening we could not watch the channel 38, missing our favorite programs with FoxNews.  When this happens, we checked and noticed that only Channel 38 is unviewable. Therefore, we can assume that not being able to view Channel 38 on our TV is intentionally done by Comcast, and could even be possibly politically motivated.We need help to investigate this problem, since our last call to Comcast we were told that it could be Channel 38's problem, not Comcast.  Comcast offered to send a technician, and I refused because they could just come and blame it on our house cable connections and the fee could be high."
1,"   When I sign on to Comcast I asked if HGTV, History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Nat Geo came with the plan and they said yes. A year and a half later, they take away Nat Geo.  How can they quote you a price for these channels and then take it away.  BUT did they reduce my rate,  HA.  "
1,I feel this is completely discriminatory.
1,"   I set up an appt. with Comcast to transfer service from Direct TV to them. I spent 30 Minutes explaining the services I needed and was promised the Tech coming out could do all I needed. He came out and could not drop the line. Comcast """"he said"" would reschedule. No call back for a week. Finally, someone they outsourced the job to came out. All the billing was wrong. I spent one hour on hold to correct the promblem before the tech ever started the install. I spoke with Erica at Comcast on4/8/09 and she promised me that she would handle everything. The first bill was only to reflect taxes. The first bill was 532.33? I made a payment on site of 174.11. I have been calling Comcast for four days with no return call back. I have left messages with managers and Erica. If they think anyone in there right mind would transfer a service that costs 550.00 to be theres they are crazy.  This has been the worst experience I have ever had with a company of there size that has no regard for a customer. Don't ever transfer your service to Comcast because they do not honor there agreement/overcharge you no one will assist with the promblem. I have documentation on everything and fully intend to call fox news and let everyone know IF YOU TRANSFER TO COMCAST IT COST YOU 550.00 to do so. I have only had service for two weeks.

1," i got a notice at the end of march saying we would be shut off on 4\24\09 if we didn't pay the balance in full. (when we moved to the place where we live now we had comcast switched over but in the process we got stuck with a bill for service at our previous residence for the few weeks that it was empty so we could clean it out before we turned in the keys. i decided to just pay on it till the balance was clean) so when the statement said they wanted the balance paid in full i thought they were talking about the 10 or 15 dollars i still had left to pay for from the move. well on 4/16/09 my service was shut off. i went in and paid 60 dollars (cuz thats all i had at that day) to get it turned back on. from what i got from the statement i got the balance was $166. so i told the lady at the payment center i would be back on the 23rd to pay the $106. i went back on the 23rd like i said i would. and i was making the payment when she told me the payment due was $83.69. i asked what the total bill was, she told me $236 & change. i asked why? she said that the $124 i paid in march was returned for insufficient funds.  i was shocked. i didn'y recieve anything from the bank saying i was being charged an over the limit fee or anything that would go along with what she was saying. i talked with my wife because we use her account for bill payments. so we went online and checked her account for comcast payments or returns and there was nothing for march. so now me and my wife have to make a conference call with her bank and comcast. because they charged us a return check fee and late payment fee along with the $124 wich was suppose to be taken. i hate comcast. when it comes to payments and things like this its always horrible. i was shocked. i didn'y recieve anything from the bank saying i was being charged an over the limit fee or anything that would go along with what she was saying. i talked with my wife because we use her account for bill payments. so we went online and checked her account for comcast payments or returns and there was nothing for march. so now me and my wife have to make a conference call with her bank and comcast. because they charged us a return check fee and late payment fee along with the $124 wich was suppose to be taken. i hate comcast. when it comes to payments and things like this its always horrible."
1, This is the poorest run company I have ever dealt with.  Everyone we have talked to states that Comcast has horrible customer service.  At one point I asked to talk to a supervisor and was told NO that they could only email a supervisor to call us back.  That is ridiculous.  Comcast needs turned over to the better business bureau.  As soon as school is over we will be changing our service and going with Direct TV who has good customer service.  
1,"In February, I requested that Comcast please not send a contractor to our apartment complex due to unsafe and sloppy work. Gary ** said that would be no problem and he understands. After this, the last service request they sent out a contractor (Orange County Communications). I sent them away and called Comcast and requested they send Comcast employees. The Comcast employees came out and did sloppy unprofessional work as well. (I used to work for a Comcast contractor.) I called Gary ** and complained and have not received any response. I would like Comcast to fix their slop and do their job correctly. I also want future work to be done correctly. We are fixing the exterior of our place and don't want spliced up cable and splitters all over the exterior of our buildings. We are helping Comcast because we are stopping satellite companies from splicing the cable and mounting Dish on exterior. This preserves the Comcast cable so they won't need to rewire every time they come out."
1,"I have sent repeated emails over the past month to Comcast regarding my cable service. The problem is that the cable service is non-functioning, but yet I am still being billed. I told them that it appears that the problem exists with their feeder lines outside of my home, but no one checked. One day, a service rep came and all he did was to replace the splitter and then he left. About three weeks ago, I received the modem for high speed internet, which I cannot use, but wish to use due to fact I do not have cable service. I am also being billed for high speed internet, but it is not even connected to the computer. I have told them many times when I was available at home, but no one has ever shown up. How many more months must I wait for service? How many more months must I pay for service, which does not exist?"
1,"My April Comcast bill was higher by $5.20. While investigating, I noticed I was charged for a movie ordered at 7:15AM on 4/3. We are not even home at 7:15 AM. After telling Comcast customer service that we did not order the movie and never have in the past ordered movies, they insisted that the order came from our box number and that they could only issue a one time credit for this. I asked if perhaps there could have been a mistake on their part, but they insisted the order came from us. This really is frightening to think that someone could have accessed our box remotely somehow to order the movie, but Comcast insisted that this could never happen. I hope their investigation of this matter finds out what really happened because if it happened to us, it can happen to others. I sure hope they improve their customer service attendants' attitudes."
1,"This problem all started when I received a bill for the month of March for over 200 dollars for cable for the month. I called up and asked why my bill jumped up so high, and they said that I rented a lot of movies that month. I wasn’t aware that anyone at the house was renting anything, so I asked around and we didn’t. I asked Comcast to look into it for me because I’ve never heard of a cable bill being so high and because we didn’t rent anything. We already pay for HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, and Stars, so we have all movie channels. Also, we have 2 cable boxes, one of which Comcast never activated and one that was broken (on-demand was down). Comcast thought it looked funny that one movie was rented 6 times in March. And we have it on DVD, so we know we didn’t rent that. Anyhow, who rents a movie 6 times in one month? We do not have a bill this month. She confirmed and said she was going to send out to me a revised statement.About a week later, I received a bill from Comcast stating that I owe $206.11. Confused, I call back into Comcast and ask why I received this if my bill was waived. They have no record of me calling at first. Then, I ask to speak with a supervisor and there isn’t one working there that day. After about an hour on the phone and long hold times, the woman comes back on the phone and tells me that the supervisor I spoke to last time added comments to the account but forgot to actually take off the $206.11. She confirms to me it’s no problem at all, and she said that she is going to go ahead and remove it again like the first person was supposed to do. I explained how long it took to get this settled last time as well as this time, and she confirmed to me she will be personally handling it and that it was removed. Once again, I ask for a written statement showing that they removed it be sent to me at my address on record. She agreed. I said, “Thank you” and we hung up.Another few days go by and I receive a letter in the mail saying that my account is overdue now (107 dollars) and I owe a total of 306 dollars. Outraged by another Comcast mistake, I call the phone number that I was given by the previous person helping me. The extension does not exist! “Not even close to an extension Comcast uses,” they said. So I start from scratch from the bottom again. Now, this is the third time I have called in on the same issue Comcast told me they are sorry about and have told me will be handled. Now, the bill is telling me that the bill is overdue and my service will be shut off if I do not pay immediately. I request time off at work and call into Comcast to once again start from scratch. This time, I ask for a supervisor right away. I talk to her for an hour, and she first told me she sees nothing on the account when I specifically asked the last person I spoke with to add comment to the account. I talk for an hour and get nowhere. She decides she is going to look into it and call me back later in the day. She calls me back at 7pm one night and tells me that she hasn’t gotten anything on it and that she’s still working on it. Meanwhile, I’m not sure if I should pay my bill or not. She said to hold off and she would place a stop on the collections until the issue was resolved. She tells me that she will call me tomorrow when she finds out what happened. Next day, no call from the supervisor who said she would call me between 5 and 6pm. I get in to work in the morning and call Venessa and leave her a message asking what’s going on and why she was not back in touch with me yesterday. I get a voice mail (doesn’t even ring). Later on that day, I get back from lunch and I have a message from Venessa saying that they looked into it and have decided not to adjust the bill. I told her that it was already decided a few weeks ago by a field technician that it was impossible for our household to rent movies and that all on-demand movies were going to be removed. She said they will stick with the inconvenience fee, but I owe them 300 dollars still. I call back and again I get a voice mail right away. This is illegal and someone needs to monitor Comcast’s Billing. There is no way anyone in my house rented any movies prior to the technician coming over to fix it. It was impossible and I have the documented receipt with his comments on it to prove it."
1,"I turned in my Comcast equipment. They said that I had an outstanding equipment so I turned in what I had and paid my bill for service up to the proper day of 1/22/09. I ended the service that day at the Comcast store. I called up DISH Network the next day and set up service. Next month, I received a bill from Comcast saying I owed them for service until February. I called and said that I disconnected their service in January. I was told that I cannot disconnect until my equipment was turned in. So for the next three months, I got billed for a service I never used or wanted. I read their terms and agreements thoroughly and nowhere does it state that. In fact, Section 9, letters B and D say otherwise. So I have talked to numerous supervisors and employees.Today, I just got a letter from collections about the service and equipment for almost $900. At best, I only owe $250 for the equipment.  It’s only because I can’t prove that they didn’t take my modem when they upgraded (which they did) and a cable box that was outdated (and also switched). I got the missing equipment in February of 2006."
1,"We subscribed to the triple play plan last month. Included in this plan is the maximum speed (not sure of the technical terms) allowed for our Internet usage. We have noticed our speed is the same and actually slower. After speaking to a Comcast rep, it was determined it was not our computer and something Comcast has to fix. I think this is a scam where you pay more for more speed but get the same speeds as before. I mean, how do you actually know? And if the speed is slower, they always blame the router or your computer. I don't buy it!"
1,"I have basic cable service and they dropped the Maryland Public TV channel from the lineup. How can this be allowed? It's not like this is some obscure channel like 86 or 93. This is channel 22, a local Maryland station. Now I have snow on channel 22. Great. Shouldn't they be required to carry local channels?"
1,"I made a past due payment of $203 on my acct. on April 4th; Comcast EFT from my checking acct. on April 6th. I went to the office and I was told I needed to talk to my bank. I called the bank and a manager tried to help me on a 3-way call. I was told it would be 24-48 hrs for my money to be refunded. When I didn't receive the money or a call from Comcast, I called them again and was told it would take 10 business days for someone to contact me about my refund. I waited and still there was no call. I called them on 4/14/09 and was told that there was a note on my acct. stating if I called back, they were to tell me that I wouldn't receive my $431 back and there was a credit on my acct. for $203 to past due balance. I paid and someone would be in contact with me. I think they are trying to wait me out so that they can use the credit on my acct. for the next billing cycle. Can you please help me?"
1,"We had the services of Comcast installed 5 weeks ago. These services included high-speed internet and digital phone service. Each of these has a host of add on's like voicemail, 911 services, taxes, etc. When the service was first installed, the phone did not work and we were ultimately provided the service 3 days later. We were told that was a trouble ticket. We explained that when we never used the phone. The justification was that it worked when the installer left so we sucked it up and just rationalized that we would pay the bill in spite of no service. The difficulty then became that all of the movers, suppliers, family that had been given the contact number were getting a message that the voicemail was not set up and were just hung up on. We did not know this so delivery people took furniture back to their warehouses and family was at a loss as to what was going on.Calls to service which is supposed to be 24 hours a day 7 days a week allowed us to discover that this is not really the case. There is no service on weekends. You can talk to a voicemail and fight your way through the voicemail system. ""Thank you for calling. Please continue to hold. We will be on the phone shortly to answer your call. Please be assured that your call will be answered as quickly as possible. Please continue to hold for a few more moments. We will be on the call shortly. Please be assured that your call will be answered as quickly as possible,"" with music provided, over and over. I am pretty sure that I have been through this several hundred if not a thousand times.Last evening, the high-speed internet went down and we were instructed that with the input of trouble ticket ** that we would have high-speed internet service in the morning, but it could take up to 72 hours. In actuality by morning, we lost our digital phone service as well. This means that we have no phone or high-speed internet. Now, I have been on the telephone with Comcast for about 2. I was calling and indicating that I wanted service on the voicemail. After getting the final question in a series of about 7 touch 2 touch 1, 2 or 3, I got to the point where I was being switched to a service professional and the phone would become disconnected. Now, this was curious so I repeated the process about 5 times to just determine if indeed this was the system. I am guessing that there is actually limited or no staff to take service calls.We have been told that we have a commercial account and many of the times that we call the information after 5 weeks that Comcast has on file for us is related to the previous owners of the number. We are in a community of 790 some homes that the homeowners association contracts with for basic cable service. One would only guess that this provides a distinct marketing advantage to Comcast. We still have no telephone service after 3 hours on the telephone with the representative. All of our I-Touch units now do not work because the reconfiguration of the router. Our Apple TV which took hours in its own right to get set up is disconnected again. We will be all day getting this set up again and for this, we will lose a day of work to be here to babysit with Comcast."
1,"I had a large Sony TV and I went into Comcast saying I want an HDTV box and service. I started having problems right away. The TV started losing picture and sound with digital squares appearing. I had made about 15 calls; they wanted me to unplug my TV to reboot the box. What a pain in the **. This is typically what Comcast will do every time you call them with a problem. Five times, Comcast came out and each time they said they fixed it. The 4th time, a girl came out and said my TV was going bad! Duh! Just imagine what I did. I went out and bought a new one. Then I found out the new service has a refurbished box. Just think: a new service with an old box. The 5th time they came out, the Comcast service guy said I did not have an IP address. Now, several months later, I am having the same problems. I’m tired of talking to people not from the United States saying unplug my box and reboot! PS: I sold a perfectly good Sony TV and a Sony surround sound system for a loss of $500."
1,"My Comcast TV Cable stopped working on November 20, 2008. A Comcast repair technician said the problem was that the Comcast signal was too weak. He fixed the problem by installing a signal booster on the line outside my home. He said I would not be charged for the trouble call. I was charged on my next bill for that call. Although I have Pay Direct bank draft to Comcast, that trouble call charge showed up on my December bill as an unpaid balance. I called Comcast billing office on December 17, 2008, and the billing support person told me to ignore that bill since their computer billed it in error. She said she had fixed the billing problem. The billing error showed up on the January bill still as an unpaid balance. I called Comcast again at their billing phone number 713-341-1000. Again, the Comcast billing office said their billing system was in error, and while I was on the phone, she (Pat) said she removed the error amount from my bill. The March billing still showed an unpaid balance. I went to the Comcast office in Webster with all of my billings and documentation, and the clerk behind the counter checked my account and said my bill was paid in full but the billing statement still said there was an unpaid balance. On April 11, I lost access to the TV cable signal. The message on my TV screen said “Unauthorized”. I executed a live chat with Comcast Customer Support person (Raymond). He checked my account and sent an ‘instant hit’ signal to reactivate my account. My complaint is that since last November, I have needed to work with Comcast each month and thus far have not received accurate billing. Additionally, I have lost service from lack of signal twice. I am considering changing to a different TV cable provider. Perhaps, I will change to DirecTV. I spent many hours trying to resolve this problem, lost the use of my TV, and when Comcast sent the ‘instant hit’ signal to reactivate my converter box, I had to go through a difficult procedure to recycle the box - that is, I had to unplug the box from the wall and re-plug it in. That sounds simple enough, but my converter box is fitted into an entertainment center. The power plug is not easily accessible. It was difficult for me."
1,"It was not the individual. All they can do is take the complaint, which she did and she apologized. What happened is that I have the full Comcast package with cable TV, internet and telephone. We upgraded to the HBO package. It is over $100 a month. The problem is I turned on my once a week special series on MasterPiece Theatre on our local public TV station and the audio feed was not working. Yet every other channel was working. As soon as the program was over, the audio came back. I missed part 3 of the Little Dorrit program - an English adaptation written by Charles Dickenson. The customer agent checked to see when it was going to be on again and could not find any part 3 being shown again. I do not want to pay Comcast over $100 a month for what I see as sub-level technology."
1,"Since getting cable for my new HD TV about 12 months ago, I have called at least 10 times for service persons to fix the problem of the picture and the sound cutting in and out and freezing. After 10 service calls by lead technicians, the problem still exists. The last service technician was just here yesterday (4-11-09). At $140 a month, I don't think I should be subjected to this shoddy service and waste of my time on the telephone with Comcast and waiting for Comcast to come to my home. Please get this problem straight or please contact an executive to get this problem taken care of. The economic damage is my payment of $140 a month times 12. The physical damage is all the headaches and stress for waiting on the phone for Comcast and waiting for someone to attempt to repair the problem."
1,"I called to set up a payment plan to pay off $190 remaining balance without having service interrupted. The person I spoke with took my checking account information and I was told everything was taken care of. The following day, my service was interrupted and when I called to see what had happened, I was told nothing was taken care of and there was nothing showing I had even had a conversation with anyone."
1,"I set up an appointment to have two cable outlets installed on Thursday, April 9th between 3:30 and 5:30pm. When I set up the appointment, I was never asked if I wanted a call on my house phone or cell phone. I asked the representative if Comcast wanted my cell phone and I was told that wouldn't be needed. I was never advised that someone would call me prior to the arrival. I was never told that if I do not answer the phone that Comcast would not come out at all. At 5:21pm, I called Comcast and was told that it looks like someone tried to call me. I was advised that a supervisor would call me after trying to find someone to come to my house. At 6:12pm, I called back to Comcast and was told someone would call me. And 2 minutes later, I did get a call back advising me I wasn't forgotten and someone would call me back with an estimated time of arrival. It is now after 11:00pm and no call no show. I am very upset!I took off work at 2:30 to make sure I would be home. I was joking to my co-workers at Verizon that I would be a missed appointment. My boss said why I am still with Comcast, not with DirecTV. I told her I like Comcast and never had problems. Plus, the high speed internet works better with Comcast vs. DSL. I need the faster download speeds, not 768k-1.5mps. My wife, for the last couple of years, wanted to change to DirecTV but I stayed with Comcast. Because of this event, the pressure is on to change. My wife and I both work on Friday, April 10th. I don't know if I will get a call from Comcast and if I do, I cannot accept cell phone calls unless it is my break or lunch. I don't want to take off and waste more of my vacation time. I would like to have the install happen after I get off work at 6pm. I would hope the install would be free and I would like some type of compensation for my time I wasted. At Verizon on dispatched calls, we must get two CBR's. On the day of the install, the tech shows up and if you are not there, then Verizon leaves. If Verizon says you will get a call back, you will get one even if it is bad news."
1,"This is the second time the same problem has occurred. After making my monthly payment by check over the phone, I received confirmation from rep also by mail. While preparing to pay next month's bill, I saw I've been charged an insufficient funds fee. My account had over $2,000 at the time I was charged this fee. After a bank rep verified this, I thought the problem was solved. This is no way to run a reputable biz."
1,"This cable company will nickel and dime you to death. We have cable/digital/ and internet service from Comcast. We lost service in February for being late with payments. I was told it was all computer-generated. I hate the fact that a computer runs my life. With losing service, I was not able to make the free payment online and was charged $2. They turned on the cable, but the second payment was 10 days late and they would not restore internet. I made second payment, again, with $2 charge. I asked to be credited for days without service. No. Why should I pay for something I wasn't allowed to have? If I miss work, I don't get paid! Okay, next bill rolls around. Both $2 charges, 2 reactivation fees @ $5.99.I made a service call for crappy reception, freezing picture, pixely, sound in & out. Man came out, changed connections around, and said that the picture should be better. I got charged for the service call, almost $30, and they blamed it on my TV. Picture is still crap. I cannot watch certain channels at all. All I asked for was to be credited the fees I had to incur, because I couldn't make the free payment ($4) and credit for days I did not have internet (which was 6 days/$27.95 per month = 90 cents /day = $5.40, and removal of the service call charge of $29.70. Total of $39.10. What frustrates me most is I cannot have a satellite dish because of living by a mountain, so they can just do whatever they want. But they did offer me a coupon for a free movie, which I can't watch?!"
1,"They double-billed us for 18 months. We had cancelled our service at **, SF and transferred the service to our new location, **, SF. They continued to bill us for service at **. We found out, alerted them and they sent us a check in November of 2008 to the old address! Since then, it has been hours of talking to representatives over the telephone, trying to get some answers as to when we will receive our check for $1080. They said it would take 4-6 weeks from February 19th, making it around April 1st that we should have received our check. I keep getting promised that someone will call us with a date of when the check will be sent to us, and still we have not received a phone call or the check."
1,"Your company has the worst customer service I have ever encountered! There are the missed appointments, lies, faulty service. Customer reps hang up on you, etc., etc., etc.! I have had no cable for over a week. The missed appointments cost me over 2 days work so far and several phone calls cost, wasted my time. Customers should file a class action suit "
1,"Well, as of today I have had two horrible experiences with Comcast. I've been with Comcast since 07/2008. Two months ago I had a chatting session with one of Comcast's representatives over upgrading my service. She gave me all this hoopla on how because I pay my bills before due date, I would get all these great deals and free promotions. Later the same day, I thought it must be too good to be true. I went online to confirm all these wonderful deals. Of course, the man had no idea. Thank God I copied and pasted the entire conversation! Well, I was P.O. of course. I informed the representative about what took place and pasted him the conversation, as well as sent the entire conversation to the FCC with a complaint. But don't get me wrong, he went above and beyond to keep me as a customer.Then, I just moved to my first home and transferred my service, and kept my box from my last place. I am unable to access On Demand (Error 4). I called this time and a gentleman who seemed tired said he will reset it, and to wait 30 minutes. I wait and guess what happened next? On the second call, I got some woman with a condescending attitude. I tried to have her just reset my box and fix the On Demand. Well, we went from the problem with my box to my billing issues (note that I had received promotional deals 2 months prior), stating that I should be paying $15 for my box, but I am only paying a fraction. I informed the woman (customer service) that I have a promotional deal. She stated that because I have a DVR-HD box (I've had this box since service started), I am being charged for just the HD. Why am I going over with the type of box that was given to me at the time I started service? She would not let up, stating I got off for months, like I was robbing them from the get-go.  I asked for a supervisor. Well, she came back on saying, ""I spoke to my supervisor and we will cut the price,"" which is more than what I am paying now. My bill is already more than what it should be. I finally got a supervisor who sounded just like the representative. She was not trying to help, either. I just said that I did not call to go over my bill (mind you I pay my bill the first of the month, every month), I called to get my box reset so I can enjoy the On Demand that I am paying for! I got it done, but for some odd reason she was so quick to set up an appointment for a service man to come and visit. Why? Can you or can you not reset my box?All in all, I am ready to settle for a dish. I felt so belittled and upset by the hour that was wasted just to fix the box. Thanks Comcast! FYI, my second letter to the FCC and State Attorney General's office will be sent. There needs to be some type of policy or procedure that your customer service center should take on manners and respect towards customers who will be loyal to your company in the future."
1,"   For months Comcast has been advertising when the digital conversion took place customers who already had cable did not have to do anything and need not worry.  About a month ago I received a phone call from a representative saying I needed to get converter boxes for my TVs because of the conversion.  I was shocked and said I thought we didn't have to worry if we already had cable and that I had not heard of this.  He explained to me this was separate from the federal converstion and that actually the commercials were a little misleading, that Comcast was going through their own converstion and if I did not get the boxes prior to March 15 we would lose channels above channel 35.  I expressed my displeasure but he said that the boxes were ""free"", no charge to comcast customers.  I told him how many tv's I had in the house and he said that exceeded the limit??? and that I would have to pay $1.99 per month per extra converter box.  Unhappy again, I said fine send them out.  It was supposed to be an easy set up - customer set up, called in and they did the transition there.  Did this, but two of the tv's, the ones with VCR's did not work right.  For a mere charge of $15.99 they would come out and install it correctly.  They came out, supposedly rewired something and said everyting was fine.  When we went to tape a show our VCR did not work.  Nothing was taped.  Tried several times, nothing.  We called, they came out again.  This technician told us that our VCR's would no longer work with the new converter boxes we just got.  He said we would need a DVR from Comcast (of course there is an additional charge of $15.95/mo plus the one time $19.99 installation - along with that $1.99/mo charge for the extra tv)or, in the alternative, we could undue all the hookups to tape from our paid for VCR and then hook everyting back to watch tv.  Okay so here we are, our bill has been $59.95/mo, now in order to apparently watch tv and be able to record a program they want us to pay $77.89 total (not including set up fees). Then there is the 2nd VCR which would be an additional $15.95 for the DVR - with a grand total of $93.84/mo.  Now, did I also tell you this is for my retired parents who are on a fixed income?  This to me is a Comcast scam to take advantage of the who federal conversation and for them to try to make more money.  My parents cannot afford this - they entertain themselves with a lot of tv watching, including taped programs from their VCR's.  I think this is unreasonable for people to expect that they can no longer use any  of their equipment (especially sine they don't have to pay a monthly fee for their paid for VCR's)  Comcast complete mislead the public and are slipping one by customers.  I feel this is a unfair business practice.  I have heard of at least 4 different people complaining about this same issue.

1,"I'm a 15-yr. Comcast customer, no disconnections ever. In Dec. 2008 due to a very large cut in my income, I called Comcast to switch from the $54/mo. plan to the $18/mo. plan. The last thing I got from Comcast was my statement/past due notice dated Feb. 25 for $146 (which I believe is an overcharge but I can't find my old statements). In early March I made an online payment of $62. On March 14 a Comcast serviceman came to my front door and spoke with my son (I'm deaf and don't deal with people at the door). He wanted $25 to avoid disconnection. I refused because I had not heard anything from Comcast and he was not driving a Comcast truck. Then he said he would take $52rt (five dollars!) which sounded suspicious. I wouldn't pay because he did not give us any papers showing a pending disconnection, and since I already made a payment for this month, I thought I was safe. A week went by and I heard nothing from Comcast. Then on Sat. March 21 while I was away, the same Comcast serviceman disconnected my cable service. He said he knocked on the door but nobody was home, which was a lie because my son was home and would have heard it. In the past when I was close to being disconnected, they would put a notice on my front door with a phone number to call. I take disconnect notices very seriously and always call the number to make arrangements. This time I got NO such notice. I was contacted via e-mail by Mr. Rudy V at the Fresno Comcast (manager), after I explained my situation. He said there was nothing he could do because I owe $82 and he couldn't find anything wrong with the serviceman's behavior. Then, on Thursday, March 26, I received in the mail a disconnection notice dated March 22, the day AFTER my cable was disconnected. If I had received it on Friday, March 20, I would have called immediately and made payment arrangements. Then, on Saturday, March 28, I got in the mail a Collection Notice from Credit Protection Association L.P. Isn't it the law that companies MUST give the consumer, in writing, advance notice of pending collection activitiy? I NEVER received any notice whatsoever of disconnection or collections. This whole incident is so unfair and I feel ripped off. I want Comcast to reconnect my cable and waive the fees and charges. The whole purpose of downgrading my Comcast service from $54/mo. to $18/mo was because I could no longer afford $54/mo. But they demanded I pay the entire bill ($146) in March. When I only paid $62 (which was already above my budget limit), they cut me off."
1,"Comcast has completely bungled the conversion to digital service. The failed to adequately communicate to customers that ALL cable customers need to get digital conversion boxes and that they would provide two for free. Instead they led customers to believe that unless they had no cable service and were receiving signals over the air that they needed to do nothing. We became aware of the need to order their cable boxes when they started dropping channels from analog transmittal. We promptly ordered boxes which were delivered quickly but required customer installation and activation by phone. I have called their service center four times over the course of the last 5 days to try to get cable boxes activated. I spoke to a supervisor the last time to no avail. They all asked me exactly the same questions and put me through the same paces bouncing from one set to the next (at opposite ends of our home). I have now done exactly the same thing four times with the same result. No activation. After being put on hold for the third time, and for a total of 40 minutes I hung up and tried live chat. I quickly saw that that was going to get me nowhere so I ended the chat session. The tech. (Mario) stayed on to check on the health of the account and he informed me that we had a balance due. However, Comcast has been withdrawing money from our primary checking account on a monthly basis for years and we just paid the latest bill last week. I am absolutely flabbergasted that this company can have such poor service that it requires its customers to install its own equipment, then spend hour after hour on the phone trying to get the equipment to work. And then...their technicians insinuate that the problem is mine because I haven't paid my bill. Unmitigated gall and arrogance. Absolutely unbelievable. I sincerely hope that this company fails due to lack of customer service. "
1,"   I have been working for Comcast for almost 7 years and due to the decline of the economy, feel my job was being pushed out the door and finding a way to terminate/fire me for my longtime employment. Back in August 2008, hit a deer on I-90 near Ritzville, WA which has been documented by the ""Washington State Patrol"" of which came out to the scene of where the accident took place and low and behold finding gasoline pouring out of the gas tank of the vehicle, which posed a safety hazard. Keep in mind my partner and I were coming back from our 2 week vacation, which during this time called my employer to let them know the status of where I was at, since I was out of vacation and flex time.This being said 4 days later while the car was in the shop returned to work the following Tuesday of that next week and was put on a written for attendance, which months later after filled out a employee appraisal of my supe on Graveyard, a week later I was called in the office with my reporting supervisor and her boss in reference to what they considered a ""Moment of misery"" as they say, which moved me over to a final written. Just this last week, called on the carpet again the week of the 16th-20th of March which we both listened to the call and confirmed one call was a moment of misery which I am not doubting, however I was also accused of recording my customer calls that I received in the call center, which I never did or would. The other call was a situation where my new boss working day shift stated it was a basic, instead submitted the call anyway which turned out to be another ""Moment of Misery"" call which as of 03/23/2009 was terminated for ""Comcast Customer Interaction Policy"" & ""Code of Conduct.""This being said 4 days later while the car was in the shop returned to work the following Tuesday of that next week and was put on a written for attendance, which months later after filled out a employee appraisal of my supe on Graveyard, a week later I was called in the office with my reporting supervisor and her boss in reference to what they considered a ""Moment of misery"" as they say, which moved me over to a final written.

1,"Couple years back,I restored my service and talked with a Customer Service tech about what is now call On Demand, digital  Video Recorder. and gave my Idea exactly what is now taking place and the rep mention he would give this information to his company and maybe in couple years we may have this in the working.  Now this is call on Demand, Digital Video Recorder. Can I get any Royalties since this was my idea? This was a conversation over the phone."
1,"For the third residence in a row, comcast failed to mail me now the second monthly statement(not in a row)  Then the next month they send me a statement with late with the previous month's balance w/late fees + this months balance...about twice what I pay.  Every time I call they say that it was sent out and they are sorry and there is nothing I can do.  This is clearly a mistake worked into their system that most people won't pick up on.  They say since service was going on, which is on again off again at best, they still charge.  How can I be expected to pay my bill on time when they do not send it and then hit me with a bill that is more then double what I normally payIn this economic turbulence, this is how comcast is handling it.  They send you a bill late so late fees are automatic and they skip months to send bills to charge more money then they would normally get.  I cannot afford this bill now.  This is an almost $400 cable bill which is outrageous.  I have always payed my bills on time but I cannot do that when I don't have a bill to pay...With the economy the way it is and people struggling financially, it makes me sick to see a huge company taking advantage of it's members like this."
1,"We had Comcast Digital Cable in the past and used AT&T for telephone and internet.  Due to the cost of services, we decided to bundle our utilities.  Two hours following the installation (which is another issue itself) we had no dial tone, no line.  Without cell phone service in our area, the only form of communication was through our internet service by way of chatting with a technician.  We were able to reset the modem and regained service.    The following day, we lost our service again.  We went through the same process, yet this time, they were unable to just reset the modem.  It took about an hour and a half to chat with the technician  who was belittling and unable to answer our questions.  We asked to speak with a superviser and were completely given the runaround.  We were told that a technician would need to come to our house, and the first available was three days later.  This was clearly unacceptable, as we have two small children in our home and no emergency service.    After going round and round (and in the process, the line coming back) we spoke with a supervisor in Texas who did very little for us.  A technician was sent out and they replaced equipment.  The telephone service was tested and the technician left our home.    Although our telephone service was working, we now had lost internet.  Another phone call to comcast and two hours later, we had all utilities.  Now this morning, we have no telephone service.  It had been one week of repairing the issue and are now in the same position we were in three weeks ago.    We have taken off time from work and are continuing to pay for a service that is completely unreliable.  What makes matters even worse is that there is no one that will listen to us.  When asked for higher up we are referred to the 1.800 number or chat.  Its unacceptable.Loss of work waiting for technician"
1,"Despite numerous calls for many years, we continue to have interruptions in services.  Comcast does not seem to be able to fix this.  We live in the city proper.  Every service person who comes out has a different story.  People have arrived on our property unannounced without identifying themselves.    They also gave out my unlisted phone number to a telemarketing firm that worked for them and then denied it, even when I explained that there were very grave circumstances that required my number not be published or shared.  While I was recovering from surgery, I was plagued with these calls. Despite numerous calls to COMCAST this was not addressed.  They continue to substitute my broadband number for my land line number in spite of my requests not to do so.   Last week they came out to perform service and left the front door open in below 50 degree weather.  There was no need for this.  They let my pet who is on medication and elderly escape.  The supervisor said we should have told them that we had a pet.  We had to search for our pet and eventually found her.  The supervisor projected an attitude, complained that he had to come out on a Saturday, and also told us we should keep all the records of service calls since he had nothing beyond 30 days.  Their service is very poor and they always have an excuse.Infliction of emotional harm, hundreds of hours reporting problems and waiting for service people and explaining the problems all over again."
1,"COMCAST has the worst Customer Service of any company I know. You go on their web site an can only find how to buy stuff, not information about their services, their programming, or even a contact to complain to... I have tried to find out what Basketball games would be televised in my area and can't find anyone who knows. I did find one customer service rep who talked to everyone she knew within COMCAST and could not find an answery so she called ESPN. Horay!!! but they didn't know what COMCAST would televise in my are only that they were broadcasting it. When you can get someone to come out to fix a problem they quote we will be there sometime between 8AM & 5PM, so you take the day off an they don't arrive until 6PM to tell you they can't fix it but you will be on the Top of their list the next day????? Why not today????"
1,We have called to ask for showtime to be taken off for 6 months. When we call they tell me it is only 5.00. I tell them I still want it taken off and that it is 14.00. I still have showtime. I go to the office and she says okay i took it off for this month and it was only 5.00 the month before. I ask for a print out of my bill and it is 14.00. They shut my cable off the day before the superbowl last year for not paying next months bill. So i did not have cable for  days I think I should get paid for that too. I have had many other mistakes on my bill and thy tell me that I pay or they will shut off my service and take me to collections. I have to have comcast cable that i don't watch to get the internet  to be able to do my homework. I am in college and have to have the internet and in this small town must got through them they over bill me and shut my internet off and it is effecting my grades. How am i gonna get a good grade when I cam not get online to site my reports. Thanks for dooming my schooling Comcast.I am out at least a 100.00 by now and hours of phone time. I also had trouble in college due to all of the trouble with the cable company I lost internet and some of my college courses are online.
1,"I am making a formal complaint against comcast cable.I had my cable installed April 2008. When I received my April bill I had charges against my bill for pay preview movies that i did not purchased, so I call Comcast and discussed this with them. they told me they would remove all charges that has not beeen removed. They are saying that April till September movies where ordered every two minutes apart. I did not order these movies and they need to be removed from my bill. By them not removing these charges as they told me in the beginning I would not be having the problems I am having now one day my cable is on the next day its off and i call everytime they tell me they will get everything squared away and the cable will be left on. its on now not sure when or if it will be cut off again.Every time I call I never get the same person or a supervisior. They never have a supervisior available.They sent me 3 bills in Jan.2008 and I called to see which bilol I needed to pay they did not know. They would call me back Never a reponse or nothing just more bills."
1,"I called comcast on Feb 10, 2009 to see if I could get a chaaper pkg deal from them. My bill was running 195.00 a month for cable and internet + taxes and fees. I ended up cxl my cable TV with Comcast after I was told there was nothing they could offer me to reduce my monthly bill. I have noticed since then that my Internet has been acting funny, sometimes good connection, sometimes low and it seems much slower. I just received my new monthly bill and of course it is wrong! I called comcast to inquire why my internet service went from 47.95 + taxes and fees to 88.63 on my bill. I spoke with Charlotte who informed me that my I had billing errors. DUH! Well come to find out comcast never informed me that my internet chges would change when I dropped my cable TV. My bill went up from 47.95 to 64.95 plus fees. What a rip off!! I was trying to SAVE money. I really feel like this is wrong! Why is comcast allowed to do this? I asked for the office of the President and was told they could not give out that # to consumers, but they would transfer me. I was prompted to leave a message. How very FRUSTRATING! "
1,"To save money I cancelled the Comcast internet service. Instead of my bill going down $45 dollars it went up $50. They told me that my price went up because I cancelled one of the services. If I want my bill to go down I need to have, cable, internet and phone provided by them. In some places this is called black mail.I need cable for my work, I'm self employed, I don't know for how long I can afford this. Without same cable programs I can't do a proper job."
1,"For the past five years I have signed up for the basic cable services and was able to view a lot more limited channels . As of 3/10/09 they have cut down the channels to 2-13 without any notice or notification. I have called and they told me that my area was audited and the mistake was corrected. In order to view those channels I will need to get a digital device which is $55 plus, I will need to upgrade my services to receive those basic channels which is around $50 a month. They must really be hurting for businnes. If I would have known this I would of ordered a converter box to receive the basic channels for free. I am outraged of how they treat there customers. "
1,A technician came on my property on either the 3rd or 4th of March and I assume to do some repair work and had to dig in the front of my house. I called that evening after finding this out and made a complaint because in the process of helping a customer or establishing service(I am not a comcast customer)he did not place the boards that I had as a border for guest parking back where he found it and did not pat the dirt back which created an area that holds water when it rains. I explained that the digging part was not a problem but not putting things back the way they found it was. I was told that someone would contact me within 24 hours and I am still waiting for results.
1,"I received a call(3/18/2009) from the Comcast equipment department saying I still had equpment for them I had already returned in July 2008.  I moved from that location over 9 months ago and I am not sure I can find the receipt.  I called the customer service office to find out why I was on this list.  Allan, a Customer Service rep answered the phone, he was very rude,did not want to help to look up my information.  I told him I wanted to speak to a supervisor and he then put me on hold for over 5 mins.  When he came back and I asked him why I was not transfered to someone else, he said was looking for the phone number for the corporate office as I requested.  I told him I did not ask for any such information,  I asked why he was being so rude and if he did not want to help me he could have just transfered me to someone else.  He said to do that, I would have to hang up and call back.  I told him he was not being very he rude about this incident.  He said he was the best Rep they had there.  I beg to differ, left that call not getting any assistance.I had to call back to speak with another Customer Service rep, who was very helpful, looked up the information on my account and saw I owed no equipment, she made a notation on my past account and advised me to call the Equipment Department to let them know of that I was not liable for any information.  I did that.  Why couldn't it be that easy with my inital call, I wasted 30 mins of my life and had to make additional calls for information I should have received in the first place."
1,"The problems with Comcast started when I bought my new HD TV.  I called to have a new HD box put in.  They gave me the 3 hour window, between 4 and 7.  7 came and went, afer numerous calls, they gracisouly gave me a $5 credit for my inconvenience.  At 11:15, over 4 hours late, the tech called and said he was turning on my street, did I want to reschedule  After trying 3 boxes he relized he was in an area where a different box was used.  Finally the tv was hooked up.  The time was nearly 1 am!A few days later we went to watch a movie on the DVD only to discover that he didn't hook it back up.  HAd tech out again, he hooked it up.  Go to watch the movie, but the audio was in the wrong place.  Again, another Tech to come, as some of the HD channels were not working either.  August, got a bill with Adult pay per view movies on, which we did not watch.  Called and they had me put a Pin on.  Was assured this would not happen again.  I am the only one with the Pin.  This Past Monday I receive the lastes bill and again there were Adult movies.  9 total.  I immediately called and explained my dilemma.  The worst part is when 5 of the movies were ordered, my family was out of state visitng my daughter at Fort Dix before she left for Iraq.  A tech was sent out to do a diagnostic on the boxes and it showed that NO PAY PER VIEW MOVIES WERE ORDERED.  Yet even after that, they refuse to remove over $100 in charges.  I have emailed my local consumer reporters and filed a complaint with the BBB and also an email to the President of  consumer affairs for Comcast.  "
1,"I have had more problems with comcast that I could possibly be able to share. One time it took them 4 service calls 12 technicians and over a month to hook up our cable box. They kept telling us that we would have to pay extra to hire a small technician to fit under our house. After all of this hassle, we ended up calling a company who came over and did it in about 20 minutes. Our cable is CONSTANTLY interrupted. I am not able to use satelite b/c we have too many trees.... How is this not a classic monopoly? The rates that they have advertised on their website are about $80 lower than what we pay, when i called to ask about this, they said that unfortunately my area wasn't involved in this deal and offered me another package that cost more. "
1,"Comcast ran advertisements saying if you bundle your internet, phone and cable services you will save money. I was quoted a price of $150.00 by Comcat. I was paying 67.00 to ATT and 107.00 to Comcast. Instaed of my cost going down my cost are greater because Comcast is charging me 70.00 for digital voice that I did not ask for and installation fees for digital voice. The issues were answered by J. Taylor by justifying the fees and not adjusting or addressing the unwarranted fees. Also, I aclled to cancell before I made the switch and Comcast convinced me not to cancel  by promising to provide additional receivers at no cost because the satelitte company had quted me a prive the same as Comcast with 6 receivers. If Comcast has done this to me I am sure they have done this to others."
1,"An installer arrived at my residence at about 2:15pm and attempted to gain entry.  I was not home, but my wife and child were.  My wife was not comfortable letting him in without me there, and she asked me to call Comcast to find out why he was there so early.  After talking with Comcast, a rep told me that she had talked with the dispatcher and the dispatcher instructed him to either wait until the scheduled appointment time, or come back during the scheduled appointment time.  I thanked her.  I get a call about 10 minutes later from my wife saying that the installer did not leave and was knocking on the door again.  I instructed her not to answer, and she told me she was getting scared because he keeps knocking every couple of seconds, and he is knocking really hard like he is angry.  I told my wife to take our son to our bedroom and lock the door.  I instructed her to call the police if she thinks he is going to break in.  I called Comcast again, and explained what was happening.  I asked them to contact the installer and tell him to stop.  My wife on the other line said that she thinks he finally stopped, but was too scared to go downstairs to check.  I came home to find that the installer had left, however I told the Comcast rep, that under no circumstances do I want this installer on my property, and that if they can't get someone else out there today, to reschedule.  I am extremely upset about this.  I know why appointments are made.  If I set an appointment that I cannot make, I contact the other party to reschedule.  I don't show up outside of the scheduled time frame and bang on the door until someone answers.  According to my wife, the installer was very rude and had an aggressive posture when she initially answered the door (only poking her head out).  He rudely told her he had been waiting outside and calling her for over 45 minutes.  We have a gated entrance and I was never called to allow his entry so she was initially confused on he gained access to the property.  He stated he is going to his truck to get equipment, and she closed and locked the door.  She then called him at a number she thought he tried to reach her from and asked him to please wait until I got home.  He then asks her where I am.  It is none of his business where I am and my wife is smart enough to know not to tell a strange man how far away from home I am.  Then he came back to our door trying to gain entry again.  This is unacceptable.  This is not the behavior we expect from a professional company like Comcast.  I realize that this man may be an independent contractor and not an employee of Comcast.  I hope you realize that men like this represent your company poorly and forced us to reconsider acquiring your services.  I would like to be informed in a timely manner of the action you take with this individual, as well as what you plan to do to reconcile with us as your client.  My wife and son were visibly shaken by this incident and my wife and 7 year old jumped when my sister knocked on the door to pick them up this afternoon.  I get a call about 10 minutes later from my wife saying that the installer did not leave and was knocking on the door again.

1,"I have had Comcast Service for 5 months now. We started with back signal issues, had to take the afternoon off from work to wait on tech. After two time I told them to just run a new feed from the road. They did that and it worked fine until it was covered. I called for service again, had them come after my work this time. The tech said everything was fine. The picture continued to freeze and break-up for a few weeks and one day the box was off with no clock nothing. Called Comcast and got it going again, this happened 3 more times until I asked to have the box changed. I drove 20 min to the service center to change the box out, got it home and it would not work. Called Comcast and got this one going, service center never activated the box. Box worked for 2 days and went blank, called Comcast to get box going, 2 days later remote would not control the box, back-up remote would not control the box. Called Comcast and they could not get it going, Had to take the box 20 min back to the service center. Lady at the service center could not give me a diffrent box, so I asked to have just the Cable TV service cancelled. I get home and find the whole thing was cancelled, my internet also. Called Comcast to get it going again to find out the lady at the service center cancelled my whole account. At that point I told them to just leave it and I will go elsewere. I have about 6 hrs of phone time and 3 hrs of drive time invested in this whole mess with Comcast, so they siad they would credit me $45.00. Ok, I later was checking the bill and figured the the bill was just paid and the $45.00 was what they have to credit me back for unussed service. This company really needs to look into finding some new employees, In theese times it should be very easy to find quality people. I am working on changeing over to DirecTv. I hope not to be back here typeing. 6 Hrs of time spent on the phone, 3 hrs of drive time changing out boxes"
1,"Comcast and FSN continually misrepresent which hockey games are going to be on the HD channel. It seems more often than not they say it will be presentedin HD but the channel is just gray screen. I have tried sending e-mails to the company I never get a response.I plan to have company to watch a game in HD which is a service we pay extra for, people show up and its not in HD. Embarrasing and a clear waste of money, we pay to see hockey in HD and we never get to. Comcast sucks!"
1,I cancelled my HBO service and was charged a $1.99 to process my cancellation! Since when do we get charged to get rid of a service?  As consumers if we decide that we don't want a service we have that option to cancel and not be charged for it.
1,"I was once a customer of comcast cable, and I had a problem with my bill being two to four hundreds a months.  Well I fail to notice that I had comcast internet service on it.  I contacted comcast to talk to one of their customer service reps.  She must had had a real bad night, she talked to me like I was something that she had just stepped on.  I cancel my service with them, and went to dish net for my cable service. now this is my beleif is  Comcast has the contract in these apts. and to keep anyone else from using dish, we can not put our dish on the balcony.  Sounds like a kick-back to me, I feel like it's wrong and so do alot of tenant.  I shouldn't have to made to watch a networt that is not worth a D.I talked to the apt. managers, and tried to contact the companies home office, and I they never return my telephone call.  This is a free country and I should not watch a  network because they have a contract, with these apt."
1,"I am writing to complain about the poor programing on cable TV.  Everything on every station is a rerun. In the last year some of the stations offered in the digital package have played the same movie over and over again as a feature film for a year.  Comcast is charging far too much money for all of these channels and the programming is horrid.  I quite HBO due to the poor programing.  Since one cannot pick the stations they want to subscribe to, you have to purchase the full package.  In the last year the programing has been outrageously horrible.  Consumers are truely being overcharged.Overcharging for poor channel programing.  Comcast and the other digital providers need to address this with the programers."
1,"Set up to get bundle package and was told by customer service that I would get the same channels.  Tech came to the house but Comcast had not set aside the correct amount of time to trunk over the phone line from Fairpoint, so they gave me a temporary phone number This was incorrect procedure, so they had to cancel my current work order and initiate a NEW work order, thus making me wait 9 more days.  The tech unhooked everything and did notre-establish the phone line in our bedroom, plus we now didn't have The Movie Channel. I called and they kept mtransferring me to the phone tech who told me I would have to wait until my appointment. They showed up in the AFTERNOON, even though I specifically took time off work in the am, so had to RE-SCHEDULE again.  When all iis said and done, I was told The Movie Channel WAS NOT part of the package.  When i complained, the customer service rep REFUSED to let me speak to a superior and I was hung up on TWICE. THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR POOR SERVICE. Once I get Fios in my neighborhood, I will switch and be done with Comcast for good.Missed 2 days work"
1,"I'm a long time Comcast customer and have had many and repeated problems with them.  My patience has finally ran out.   A few weeks ago I moved to a new address with my brother. I cancelled my old Comcast account and joined his. We decided to expand our cable package and add a second TV.   We called Comcast and explained what we wanted to do. They said we would need two new cable boxes and that they would send them by mail and we could install them ourselves with help over the phone.  The boxes dully arrived.  We installed one. The second, for the new location, did not work. We called Comcast. Now we were told something completely different: that that location had never had cable hooked up before and therefore a technician would need to come out and make the necessary connections.  Needless to say, no one mentioned this when we first ordered the extended service and Comcast could offer no explanation why.  We managed to get an appointment for about two weeks later. A duly tech. arrived.  It turned out he would have to get into the crawl space under the house.  As this is a standard procedure for Comcast you would think they would be prepared. But he wasn't, and furthermore, he was too big to get into the crawl space. He said we would need to set up another appointment with a different tech. who could get into our crawl space.  We called Comcast again. The earliest appointment they had was three weeks later, March 5, today.  I waited  patiently for today. I cancelled all my plans to be here. Then I waited all morning. No tech!  We called Comcast and were told they didn't have any appointment for us in the system.    We asked to speak to a supervisor. we asked that a new appointment be rushed through. they refused to budge. The earliest we could get another appointment is at least two weeks from now, by which time it will be nearly two months since this whole thing started.  I've had enough of Comcast.  There must be better options out there."
1,"I have used the bundled services from this company for over a year and have the following cautions. 1.  If a consumer has any inkling that they will be moving for any reason, DO NOT USE SUBSCRIBE to the email or telephone service.  Comcast has absolutely no way to allow you to use these services if you are not in their service area.  Since I am moving, I will now have to move my phone service yet again to another provider so that I can retain my phone number.  I will be unable in any way shape or form to retain my email address and would never have changed everything to them if I had known that they have no way of allowing me to subscribe to the email service without physically being in their service area and having their piece of equipment. Most other companies that provide email services have figured out how to allow customers to retain their address and have been able to charge for this service. This just adds one more stress to a move and will be very disruptive to my business. 2.  I converted to Digital Cable and have had nothing but problems with receiving cable on the auxiliary or small box.  They told me that it would provide me with the same quality and access to channels that I had before converting.  This is not the case.  Over 25% of the stations that I had before now come up with Service has been interrupted.  The rest have problems with both the audio and video cutting in and out. After numerous calls to Comcast to get the box reset, new signals sent, etc. I am still in the same position.  The full box works just fine. 3.  The staff at the call centers has definately moved down the scale in the politeness and helpfulness categories.  They used to be eager to assist. Now they are argumentative and extremely defensive.  Is there some new training being given them to teach them how to do this or is this company degenrating to the service level of many of the ones who have placed their call centers outside of the USA?  Their staff is certainly acting like they don't care about their customers any longer. "
1,"After waiting a 6 weeks for comcast to set up the home phone in my new house (they had come out earlier, but had not set it up correctly), I got my new phone number in January 2009.  I gave the number to no one, since I use my cell.  I never filled out a form with the phone number.  Only Comcast knows the number and the name that goes with it.  In the past 4 weeks, I have rec'd sales called, repeatedly.  When I called Comcast to complain that they sold my name and number, I asked that I be given a new number that was not sold.  I was told there was a fee to get a new number and there was no way to guarantee that the information would be kept confidential."
1,Comcast owes me an overpayment refund of $97.69 since Nov.2008.  I was told that I should wait 3-6 weeks for the refund; In Jan I phoned to a supervisor they said that disconnect hadn't happened until Dec.30th. I called in Feb. and they said disconnect for the service hadn't happened until Feb.3rd. I got a bill on Feb.12th stating installation charges of $97.69 without a check; they told me to ignore the statement; I still don't have the refund.  Can you help I need to pay for a mortgage and pay expenses
1,"To Whom It May Concern,  I am writing to explain my consumer issue with Comcast.    I have digital cable and high-speed internet through Comcast.  On Feb 10th, I attempted to call about a service outage.  It took me 30 minutes to get through to someone.  I told the representative in Knoxville, TN that I was having problems with my cable service, was there someone I could talk to in Memphis?  I was told no?.  I therefore had to explain my problem to someone that did not service my area and to my knowledge did not really care either.  My problem was: outage, freeze-up of digital picture, poor reception, no I-Control channel. A service call was issued for Feb 13th.  The service technician came and went.  He claimed to have fixed the problem with an adapter device in my attic.  Everything was working until 2 days later.  I put another call into Comcast and I was told that they could not get anyone until Feb 21st.  The service technician came on the 21st of Feb and installed a new box because the old box wasnt working properly.  When he left, everything was working until 3 days later when we lost the quality of our HD programming.  I put ANOTHER call into Comcast.  A technician came out and I was told that the HD signal was out of range.  I told the technician that I did not think it was his fault but that we had been very frustrated with the service.  He gave me his cell phone number to call but when we lost our service entirely after 1 hour, I called and could not get through.  I have been told that this is a tactic used to get out of the house quicker.  After losing both our digital cable and internet all together, I called Comcast again having to remain on the phone for 25 minutes before reaching anyone to tell them that we had no service at all.   In the Memphis area, folks that live in Germantown are not treated with the same courtesy as those in Memphis.  Our services are worse and it takes longer to get things fixed.  It is because there is racial polarity with the two communities.  Given that, I feel we were not only given terrible service by Comcast, but we feel that this was racially motivated.  I do not feel that we should be discriminated against nor do I feel that we will ever get our service repaired.   At the time of this letter, we still do not have our situation resolved.  We also feel that the situation will worsen once this is investigated.  Comcast has spent hours, days trying to fix problems in our area but to no avail.  This had been going for a month. I have a small business, I pay my bills online, etc.  and I cannot do this without my internet service.  I am missing calls to my home because I have Magicjack phone through my computer and it requires broadband.  I cannot keep up with dangerous weather coming nor can I keep informed of news that affects me and my family."
1,"I was having problems with getting Cable On Demand and a technician came out to resolve the problem on 12-5-08.  After over an hour in my home unable to resolve the problem he went outside and ran what he called a temporary line, which was an orange cable that he ran across the front of my home, which includes my front door. I started calling Comcast Mid December and have been calling them ever since to have them come an run the cable the correct way but they have not done so.  They told me they had to contact the utility companies because they had to mark the area so that they can bury the line, however, they told me this back in December and again in January. The Cable poses a safety hazard as well as being unsightly.  I tripped on the cable about a month ago and my 82 year old dad tripped on the cable last week coming into my home.  The last time I called cable was on 2/26/09 and after waiting on hold for about 45 minutes waiting to speak with a supervisor, he told me someone would come out on Sat 2/28, they never came. I have spent countless hours on the phone with Comcast and I'm at my wits end trying to get this problem resolved and feel helpless and frustrated. I'm hoping you can help me get this problem resolved and look into the way Comcast treats their customers. I'm sure I'm not the first customer that has experienced the run around that Comcast has given me over the last 3 months but I hope it's the last and that Comcast has a higher authority to answer to.  Thank you for any assistance you can give me with this matter.I'm thankful that neither myself nor my dad were hurt when we tripped on the cable, but I don't want to wait for something bad to happen.  I'm extremely stressed over this situation."
1,"If you send in the rebate they won't give you one because they'll say you didn't put in your order number. Thing is there is no place to put the order number in on the rebate. When I called to tell them this they told me I had to resubmit the request even though I had the number ready for them. So, I'm out of $125. I sure wish I had gone with Quest. Anybody but Comcast would have been better...lost $125 rebate even though I filled it out on time, completely and accurately."
1,"Every sunday the Fox News channel goes off the air or is srambled. This occurs every Sunday without fail. I believe an employee who works on Sunday's has an agenda.I pay $134.00 per month for Comcast. Unable to talk to anyone at Comcast about this. The FCC should investigate this problem.This is fraud, we  should certainly get  the channels we pay for."
1,"For 9 months Comcast double billed me. It was not a large amount, only $6/mo and admittedly I should have spotted it earlier, but when I called it to their attention I was told they could only adjust one month - $6 bucks. They apparently consider the other $48 additional profit since I didnt catch it before the first month. And the customer disservice voice wouldn't even let me speak with a supervisor about it.Does that seem right? It's apparently legal, but its infuriating. I know we are supposed to complain to our local franchise authority (LFA), but Im wondering, does the LFA really give a rats asteroid about consumers? And even if they did, who has bigger teeth, Comcast or some local franchise authority. Wonder what a small claims court outcome would be. Its not as much the $56 as it is the attitude that. we can do whatever we want and theres nothing you can do about it.?Another satisfied customer. Competition can't get here too soon for me."
1,I'm tired of comcast Reps trying to get me to pay a month in advance it does not make sense and if any other companies are doing this it should be stopped!  It is a form of harrassment the economy is bad right now. If you are late getting the bill they disconnect your service with out warning.when comcast disconnect your service it mess up the coloration of the picture and a off set of the picture tube which damages your TV.
1,"When I tried to get the service, the tech didn't show up, supposedly he did, but never rang the bell or knock on the door at all. So I called again, and finally got it connected.  Surprise, they didn't give me the package that they offered to me in the first place, I was going to end up paying 25 extra dollars for 6 months, so I called to find out why and they said that the package wasn't available anymore, and this and that, then I told them to cancel it, and they changed their minds and gave me the original price as a courtesy  oh, surprise, they kept charging me the same amount, and I called again to find out what was going on, and they said that it takes times for it to show up,2 months later, I called again and tried to cancel for the same reason, but I believed him, and I even asked him to remove a package that I didn't need anymore, and was told that the changes and the credit was gonna show up in my next bill  oh, surprise, 2 months later, I still get the same price, and they didn't remove the package that I told them (Selecto in spanish),So after 2 calls, and like over 1 hours of waiting, I changed the option in the phone and finally spoke to a CS, she tried to convince me to keep it, that it was a mistake they didn't make the changes, but she could ask a sup to authorize it right there, well, no, I won't deal with you guys anymore  she changed her tone of voice, and that if I didn't return the box in 10 days I was gonna be charged 150 for it and that I owed them 15, so I suppose that I'm not gonna get a credit after all for the extra 100 dlls that I paid them for the mistakeI was overcharged for a service that they offered me at a lower price"
1,"   I have had cable for several years now, up until just about a year ago it was with Insight, whom I never had any problems with.  Then Insight was bought out in my area by Comcast and it has been a nightmare.  Initially seemed ok, the price went up slightly but I could deal.  Then we moved to a different city and had our services transferred and the problems began.  First, when we moved we upgraded to a digital package with dvr, on demand, movie channels, etc.  First we were told the dvr would not work with any of our tvs because they were too old.  All of our tvs are at most only a few years old, so i don't believe that.  Then we found since we don't have the dvr we can't access on demand.  Then we discovered that we have even less channels then we did before we moved...but yet we're paying more.  Well that's annoying enough, but now comes the billing issues.  One of our fist bills after moving claims that we are past due.  I know that i had not missed a bill and had the bank records to prove it.  But for 3 months they kept claiming I had not paid,  so finally i just went and paid it all.  Three months after this I receive a bill showing a credit for them having overcharged me.  Fine.  Two months after that I recieve a bill saying past due, here we go again.  I sent my last payment with a copy of the bank stub showing the payment.  Yet my next bill comes today still saying past due.  I call and complain and am told that even though I have made all my payments and that all I technically ""need"" to pay right now is $135 my account balance is still $280 and there is nothing they can do about that.  I demand to speak to a manager and am refused being told that I am not listening to them and a manager would only tell me the exact same thing.  I am then put on hold and forgotten about.  I am disgusted by this.  On top of all this, about two months ago my monthly charges suddenly jumped from $90 a month to $140 and I have no idea why.  I am done with comcast.  Unfortunately they're the best Broadband provider in my area so I have no option but to keep them for that, but my TV will soon be provided to me by a dish network!

1,"I order a new service they send a technician on Saturday February 21, 2009. Comcast charge me for installation and other services that same day. Such the technician did not do anything he did not install nothing. But the big complaint is that the comcast technician stole my husband 300 hundred dollars from his wallet in our bedroom. I call comcast tell them about it they said it will take 5 days to call me back. I am waiting for their call also got a police report too. I dont know what to do.we need the money back because I have 3 girls to buy food and have to pay bills too."
1,"We had Comcast Cable in 2006 when we lived in Troy, Michigan. They lost a check we wrote to pay our bill in April 2006. When we moved from Troy in June 2006 we paid our bill in full and closed our account. In December 2008 that missing check was cashed through our checking account by Comcast. I attempted to contact Comcast that we didn't owe them any money and didn't even have and account with them any longer. Funny, they couldn't find our account. When I tried to ask where they applied this money to, no one could tell me. I did talk to one very nice supervisor, Sylvia who said she would attempt to get me my refund check. 8 weeks and 9 phone calls later, I still don't have my money. I get a run around every time I call. Employees won't let me speak with a supervisor when I call. They are too busy and take my number to have someone call me back, but I never get a return phone call. Comcast must be making a fortune on billing mistakes and since there is no accountability, someone is walking off with the cash. Maybe this is how Comcast funds their bonuses for their employees? I realize that $48.95 isn't a lot of money and I probably have spent more than that in time now trying to get it back. It is the principle of it. I have tried calling, sending them an e-mail and letters - who do you report something like this to and get any results?"
1,"My Comcast modem fried.  Fine, I go out and I buy a new modem from Best Buy. I get home and call Comcast to register my modem.   I spent FIVE days talking to seperate employees at Comcast who didnt have a clue what they were doing. FIVE DAYS, talking to several different people. I got excuses ranging from Your modem isnt compatable with Comcast (It said it was compatable on the BOX and I told them that, they still exclaimed it wasnt a compatable piece of hardware) to Your modem is broken, contact the manufacturer. After five days or argueing with people I FINALLY got one guy who seemed to have English as a first language who seemed shocked that any of the idiots I spoke to before would give me such garbage answers.  He literally fixed my modem in five minutes. The training these customer service techs at Comcast have is pathetic. My new modem worked fine for a few months up until recently I started losing my internet connection every four or five minutes. I will be connected for a few minutes, get disconnected, wait four or five minutes and it comes back up, then I get disconnected again.  I call in and Comcast tells me my modem must be going bad. So I go to the Comcast outlet and trade in my old broken Comcast modem for a new Comcast modem. I get home to install the modem and it doesnt work.  I call Comcast and apparently I have to get this modem activated. Fine, no big deal. In very broken English the woman tells me that the only people who can activate it closed 30 minutes ago, I need to call back tomorrow.I have figured out that any time you get someone at Comcast with English as a second language just to hang up in their face and call back. I did. I got someone who spoke English as a first language and my modem was registered and working within five minutes.  But, the disconnection issue reared its ugly head once more after only a few minutes. Surprise, its not the modem after all, its Comcast's service.  So I call back and explain my modem is brand new and I am still getting disconnected repeatedly. The fellow with his horribly broken English tells me its my router, I say calmly, I DONT USE A ROUTER! and I hang up.  I call back and get a fellow who doesnt speak English as a first language (Yes this is a big issue for me, I have never had one person at Comcast with English as a second language help me, they always give me [bad] answers.) I kindly ask immedietly to be given to someone who has English as a first language, they quickly transfer me to a fellow named Edward. Edward understands my problem no big deal, he tells me to give him a moment, he does something on his end, within five minutes my modem appears to be working fine.  It worked for a couple of hours, then went right back to the same disconnection issues. I am pulling my hair out with Comcast's constant [problems].   I think they have just overloaded their servers and people are getting disconnected repeatedly because Comcast is having trouble handling the volume of users in my area and they just dont want to admit the issue.  This service is pathetic and I would [not want to use] Comcast service again.   "
1,No service for 10 days and very very poor costumer service 
1,"I have been a comcast cable user from 2003 up till now.As a valued customer .I would like some justice.  on the day of the oscars my black box was out of service .I called the Customer service and they said they cannot help me that day but would give me an appointment for wednesday between 7am -9am.  on tuesday at 7pm they confirmed my appointment and said that a tech will arrive between 7am-9am. at 9am, there was no tech so i called customerservice and asked where he was and they said they cannot do anything and i should wait.I was shocked and I said why did you take my appointment when you cannot meet the service requirements. I said I would like to speak with the supervisor and she said there was none.I said I would like to complain and she said I cannot do that too. and then she says thankyou for choosing Comcast.  I called again at 10:40 am and spoke to Tony asking him to disconnect my service. Why do I have to go thru hell if Comcast cannot do thir work. He said he wuld log a complaint and i should keep waiting.  Here I am its 11:35 and there is no news of anyone Neiter the tech nor a phone call to check  from comcast that if the customer is satisfied if their work. waitng for comcast and they not doing their job -no peace, stressful, disgusted metal harrasment."
1,"The first incident was when we ordered our new digital cable box.  We agreed on a time frame of 3 - 4 hours. I spent all day waiting for the arrival and they never showed up.  Called and was told they would come the next day. They did arrive first thing the next day.   Today was my second bad experience of waiting for comcast to come for a service call. New HD TV and need the proper hook up.  Again, waited all day, planning my week around kids, errands and other appointments only to have them not show up again and NOT call.  When I called I got a recording that they would be there the next day between 8 - 11 am.  This is unexeptable!  I rearranged my day around the first appointment.  I wouldn't be so aggrevated if this only happened once.   With the economy so bad right now and Comcast has such a corner on the market - why can't they hire more technicians to be able to handle all the service calls.  We pay a very high monthly rate for our cable and internet service to be treated this way. I'm a stay at home mom so I can't really put an economic figure on my time.  So far it is a total of about 12 hours that I've wasted waiting for Comcast to arrive at my home.  Not to mention having other people pick up my children while I waited.  What is my time worth??"
1,"I called to complain about the hike in my bill...I was paying $97.24 a month for Cable TV & Internet Service, they raised the payment to $131.93. They said I was getting a 6 month reduction & my time had run out. I told the young lady that I was thinking of disconnecting my Comcast & going with a dish network. She then threatened to charge me with a $450 disconnect fee. I have been with comcast for 20 yrs.Frustration!"
1,"I moved into an apartment, and called Comcast to get cable.  I talked to a customer service rep - she said I would need to pay a $100 deposit for the DVR box.    I said, I'm a previous customer, I had cable with you guys about a year ago.  I returned my DVR in perfect condition.  Can you waive the deposit?  The rep said yes.   About 4 days later I get a letter from Comcast saying that due to some derrogatory information in my credit report received from Experian, they were forced to charge me a $100 deposit before the could set up my service.   Now I know this is [untrue], because my credit rating is excellent.  But just in case I check with Experian.  Sure enough, there's not one derrogatory word on my credit report.  I have taken great pains over the years to preserve my good credit, so when someone says I have bad credit, it really, really angers me. So I call Comcast back and tell them about the letter, tell them their information was faulty. The rep says, Oh, ok, just disregard that.  I am certain they never even ran my credit.  I never gave them my SSN, so I don't see how they could have.  I think they have a form letter, they lie and say have bad credit just to get the deposit money from you.  Lying. I hate monopolies!   "
1,   Initital contact to lower cable bill; was quoted (by Danny) $144.95 + tax with installation of telephone line; all else remains same; then connected me with service department; talked with Niecey; she told me bill would increase to $176 plus tax; then recanted and told me $176 plus many other current services still needed to be added to bill;
1,"   For 1 1/2 yrs i have been trying to get help with fraudulent promises never kepy by COMCAST. They refused to help, abused me, removed service instaed of fulfilling their promise of free2 digital boxes, I removed HBO- to lower my bills- I'm a dying older sick poor woman- who cannot afford $100 a mo for 6 channels that I actually use. My original agreement with HBO was $55-60 a month. After I removed HBO to lower my bill- theu deliberately and viciously increaded my bill to $80 a month!!!!
I went to see a leagl aid lawyer volunteer at teh Sr Cntr- and he did NOTHING! He reffered me to his freind- who is an advocate at City Hall- he did NOTHING!I spoke with an Exec at COMCAST about all this and she just abused me and lied continuously and no agreement was made- it was left in limbo. Then suddenly-about a week ago- they sent me a threatening letter saying that they were going to charge me $100 to reinstall my Internet, phone, and TV Cable- if I didn't pay tham about $200!!!!!
I do NOT have Internet or Phone with them. My phone is Verizon and I only have Cable. So- I called them and asked them to have my Bldg Rep from COMCASY call me about all this mess-HE DID NOT CALL!!!!!Last Thurs- they cut off my service.I spoke with an Exec at COMCAST about all this and she just abused me and lied continuously and no agreement was made- it was left in limbo.

1,I think it is ridiculous to wait 14 minutes to talk to a real person and having to go through tons of recordings and pushing this button and that button forever. What a terrible way to give customers lack of service!!!
1,"For months now, my cable goes in and out. Sometimes it stays off for 5 to 10 minutes and then comes back on again. We have called numerous times to complain and possibly get it fixed. We have had a technician come out a few times as well, but every time they leave again, it still stays the same way. Sometimes we try to access the On Demand feature and it is not working. We call the number. They hook us up with someone from Rockford, and they tell us that they are experiencing difficulties AGAIN! Sometimes, when we call it takes us to an automated message that says the same thing which leads me to believe that they leave the same message from the last time on the automated machine to get rid of people quickly. They always say that there are technicians working on the issues at that moment. That they have sent out their people and the problem will be taken care of shortly. This is getting VERY frustrating!! We miss out on a lot of shows. I am tempted to just cancel it, and keep internet. Also, when we signed up for cable and internet, the package deal was supposed to be 75 dollars, but it never has been this. I feel very ripped off and dissatisfied."
1,"I closed my COMCAST account last Oct 2008, returned the cable box, and was notified that I had a credit and this will be sent. On Feb 11, I got a disconnection notice, saying I owe them money. Trying to understand what happened, I called them and over the next couple of days, kept being passed around until finally got the billing folks. They said there was activity on my account despite my asking it to be closed, payment was made from a wrong account, and checks were sent out. As result, I owe them more money.At this point, having spent well over 2 plus hours to understand what happened and still being confused, I asked Rachel, the billing sup., to put in writing what happened in my account and send me a copy, especially the items she is using to substantiate billing me even after I asked my account to be closed. Note, I do have a receipt for this closing date and as proof, they have the cable box. She would not do it, and said I owe them money and we were at an impasse."
1,"To COMCAST, please read my quick note regarding my perception, and a widely viewed similar description by many in Houston, and noted in the BBB and reported on local stations. Comcast is utterly incompetent since taking over for Time Warner. I will spare you with any detailed items except to note my last encounter with Comcast that finally pushed me over the edge.I have high speed internet, phone, and cable with Comcast, and average over $200 per month (2008, I spent approx. $2400 wit Comcast). I recently tried using my phone and when it dialed any number, it went straight to Comcast. I called Comcast and after testing and discussing with (2) different people on the phone, they scheduled a Comcast rep to come and fix between 8-11:30 a.m. on Weds. I took the morning off from work for this. They never showed up and when I called Comcast to see what was up, they informed me my service appointment was cancelled internally by someone at Comcast.I asked why this was cancelled and no answer was given or explained, except to go over all that was tried before over the phone for solution, opposed to seeing why this had happened or making priority to get someone out ASAP based on the circumstances! I asked why no one even bothered to call me to tell me that as I had left my cell phone # when service was scheduled, for this exact purpose? When I asked to talk to a manager, I was told that managers do not talk directly with customers? My translation to that is so many people are complaining now that they stopped taking calls or that customer service and satisfaction is an irrelevant company policy?I took a valued personnel day from work to do this, yet rectifying the situation that is 100% not my fault is handled in a manner lacking the most basic integrity in terms of business sense or common decency. I myself hold a respectable business position for the past (20) years in Houston, and not once have I been so appalled by lack of service from a company that I have taken the time to write a letter until now.I am planning to cancel my cable immediately with my other services to follow. Losing myself as a client will not have any effect on your bottom line, but rest assured that Houston has many disgusted customers who express this same sentiment. With the economy the way that it is, cable is not a necessity but a luxury that many people are not going to be able to afford. If you are going to charge the highest rates of any provider for these types of services, then may I suggest you have staff and services that back it up. I will happily pay extra for a product or service if it is worth it. However, I would never spend $35.00 for a meal from a McDonald's which seems like a synonymous example of the type of service Comcast is selling to the Houston market. Please be sure that I will make a point to share the complete lack of integrity or professionalism Comcast has displayed. I have also sent a copy of this letter to Consumer Affairs website and local stations here."
1,"I called asking for technical assistance. Requesting IP address info. After verifying account with a few polite questions (phone num, address, last bill amt), she refused to supply me with IP info. Kept insisting on my answering unrelated questions. Very poor customer relations. Little effort to meet my customer needs. Arrogant. Very irritating. Unable to obtain IP address nor any helpful response. No suggestions, nothing."
1,"I am enjoying reading the complaints below - I wholeheartedly agree with each and every one of you. I myself am a former employee - let me just clue you guys in on a few things:This company price gouges because they can (the whole monopoly status is pegged right where it should be). You get such poor service because people like me can't take it anymore (no offense guys, I really empathize with you). You call in to complain to another of many reps for a specific problem, you get to me and belittle, berate, cut me down so low, don't let me get a word in, refuse my help, and yell a slur of obscenities at me - of course I will shut down, I won't help you and I will give bad info to get back at you (since the company won't let us hang up, we are forced to take the abuse) - it's all I can do. The morale at work is so low and turnover so high since we are forced to deal with something the company could easily fix by spending a little money.We have to go through a 2-month training before we ever make it to the call center floor (we study really hard, and when you get to the floor you're told to forget everything you learned) so now I'm stuck in training all over again and you get angry since I don't know what I am doing now. They don't care - if they did sites like this wouldn't exist. They get the money, give you bad service and sit back on their boot heels laughing it up thinking of new ways to make money (trying a cell phone venture, they already purchased air space) when they can't even get 3 little services right!!I am really sorry, and I am the first to apologize about what happens when you call - I used to be the sweetest person, but when the company gives you tools to help customers and then tells you -""Oh I think you need to do it this way instead,"" and ""Oh, by the way we're grading your call (yup all calls were graded and your job depended on it)"" and ""You have to push to sell more products even if they have issues with one that you can't fix (why do I want to sell you a crap product if the one you originally called about doesn't work - what kind of faith are you going to have in my service).""When you call just remember what I told ya - don't fault the person on the phone (unless they are just brain dead) people like me were so mentally abused by customers that we didn't want to do our jobs - exercise a little patience - I jumped through hoops for people that were kind to me...but if you were a jerk I shut down and made their life just as miserable as you made mine. These poor people answering phones are constantly told conflicting things, badgered by call center higher-ups, and belittled by customers - give 'em a small break.I completely agreed with all the frustrations. They were pretty accurate judging by what went on in my area - I do apologize for the company as a whole since they are pretty pathetic. Keep on writing the BBB, doing letter campaigns, starting websites - they will eventually get it (that is how Comcrap came across Twitter.com where customers went to rant and rave and really improved on some people). Just remember that no matter how big they are that they will eventually fall with the bad practices that they have."
1,"I signed on to be a Comcast Customer to get the triple play<<""Internet, TV, Phone"". I was unable to get the triple play because the wiring in the building is bad. The only thing that I was able to get was just the cable and even the cable did not work right. The on demand feature came in all distorted and broken up. And whenever there was bad weather the cable would break up as well. I saw an ad from Comcast that they are promoting basic cable services $10 a month for 6 months. And yet, we have been stuck with pathetic service, and my next door neighbor in the apartment next to me gets the triple play and everything else. Why can't we? And we are being left with $200 Bill or more for services that were never rendered. This is unfair and unjust. With the Conversion to Digital in a few weeks, we are stuck with the signal that is coming off the soon to be extinct antenna on the roof. Something has to be done with this. Please can you help?"
1,"Returned equipment, got charged, asked for refund. Said they would. Got partial, called. They said that was all. Complained to BBB. They still don't want to return my money or apologize for their rudeness or ignorance. It's not much, but it is the principle, and their rates have gone up astronomically and at a steady rate. I'm surprised they're still in business. Their quality has gone way down, but the prices sky high. As I said, I am going through Better Business Bureau, but want as many people and businesses to know about this - there is no integrity. Do they pro-rate what they owe you?"
1,"Scheduled new service between 1-3pm. No one came until 5:15pm. No call from technician or dispatch for reason of delay. Lived in northeast Phila for 10 yrs. 3 different places and never had bad service until I moved to west Phila. I feel that your company treats people in the lower income parts of the city with really bad service compared to the suburban areas of Phila, PA."
1,The Comcast system is set up to make it virtually impossible to get someone to talk to. I called what I thought was Comcast but turned out to be someone from Sirius radio selling that. I have spent the whole entire morning and have not yet reached anybody. Dreadful.
1,"Comcast has to have the most inept people around or at least some of them. I subscribe to their triple play and while going over my bill realized that I was billed for directory assistance at .99 cents. I never use this service. I spoke to James operator ** appeared to be a friendly person but it went round and round for over a half hour. Yes over a half hour before it was ever removed. At one point he asked if I wanted the directory assistance feature removed and said no. He just couldn't understand my saying no and went on and on. Just plain dumb and bad training. Right now I am sitting and waiting for a supervisor to call me back. It's not the .99 cents. It's just Comcast's continual bad, bad service. Amazingly bad. Oh, from time to time I've gotten very helpful people at this company but not often enough."
1,"I subscribed to a promotion for Digital Preferred which included on-demand and a great many other channels, but I was primarily interested in access to C-Spans 1 and 1, plus all the news programs - CNN, MSNBC, etc. This was prior to the election which I was following closely. Unfortunately, much of the time, I was unable to get the channels I'd subscribed to, and I got the usual runaround about signals when I called. I felt that some channels were being intentionally blocked and that seemed to be proved when I got messages that the channel was ""temporarily unavailable""; yet if I disconnected the box and connected the cable directly to the TV, I got those channels (CNN, MSNBC, etc.). After numerous calls, and after the election, I had had enough. I called and asked to downgrade my service to basic. I was told that there was no available appointment for a technician to come out for 11 days! I said, ""fine, but I want to stop being charged today."" I was informed that the charges would continue until the disconnection date. I can't imagine any other utility that could get away with something like that. I have to pay for eleven days because they couldn't get a technician here sooner? Nonsense. So I called the franchise holder, who in this case happens to be the city I reside in, and I requested they intervene to prevent Comcast from gouging customers in that fashion. Later, after the downgrade, I checked my bill online and noticed that they charged me a disconnection fee! I am now going to call them and have the cable removed altogether. There's only one way to deal with such an arrogant, out-of-control company, and that's to stop doing business with them. I can't get any other service here. Where I am located, Direct TV or other satellite services will not work, and AT&T has yet to make inroads to my building, so I am going to be without TV, but that's okay. I went without it for years, and going without it now is for a good cause. I encourage those who have been similarly abused by this rouge company to join me in boycotting them. Only when their pocketbook is affected will they begin to understand the concept of consumer service. How foolish is it of us to allow them to treat us this way when we are the ones in control? Turn them off."
1,"Poor service in general. Faulty equipment DVR receiver that they wanted to charge me to fix. Claimed it might be my outlet. My husband is also a technician, and found the excuse laughable because everything else works from that outlet, including the signal itself. They would in no way assist me in my quest to feel like a respected consumer of more than 10 years to them. I don't know about anyone else, but if I treated my customers in this way, I would have none! Billing issues and poor customer service, as well as the malfunctioning equipment. I cancelled my service.I now am forced to shut my business down for a day, which costs me and my customers time & money! To have another service provider installed. Not to mention the sheer frustration of feeling undervalued. The moral of the story, in an economy such as ours, I cannot believe Comcast would rather lose a long time customer than treat them with the respect they deserve, in order to save the company money, or face, or whatever it is that they would sell me down the river for. Who needs it! "
1,"I contracted with Comcast to bundle our internet, cable and phone. What a fiasco. We were provided with a bad DVR, and received no video, intermittent audio on one Sony Bravia new tv. The third tech changed out the DVR, which is exactly what we told the first tech to do! The first tech amplified the cable, but in doing so also amplified the cable to the computer modem - not a good thing. The second tech jiggled some cables to the DVR and that was it - a signal but of a few minutes - and went out right when he left. The next day the third guy - with a lot more brains - finally changed the DVR - and voila - we have had no problems since. However..... the idiots that installed the new modem in order to bundle our phone service obviously has not connected something correctly. And I really hate to have another unqualified Comcast contractor to attempt to diagnose the problems with the phone. I told them when ordering the bundle, I DO NOT WANT COMCAST VOICE MAIL - I have an answering device. Well, my answering machine does not activate, nor do I have caller ID! After frequent calls to obviously inefficient customer service reps, the problem is not resolved. Furthermore, the only phone that rings is in my husband's study where the computer modem is installed. The base phone and other handsets in the home do not ring. I have spoken with so many Comcast people until I am blue in the face. And they charged $24.95 for three techs to resolve the bad DVR issue. I refuse to pay this. We are not able to subscribe to AT&T cable, and I do not opt for satellite television, so we are stuck between a rock and a hard spot with Comcast until such time AT&T has installed the fiber optics. If there is a customer advocacy group to help resolve Comcast issues, I would love to know who that is! Also, I was given different bundle rates by different Comcast reps - the right hand does not know what the left hand does."
1,"Poor value, long wait times on hold, incompetent techs, they out twice and asked me for my advice! What the hell is that, I still have fuzzy television. So ticked off @ them. That’s only the problem w/ service. Not to mention disconnecting our family's service twice by accident, called, waited, was told it would be 8 days. I told the operator I could fix it myself (screwing my co-axial back into the block outside our townhome). The operator said ok, if you know how to! What am I supposed to do? $100+ a month for this, get lost! We have been overpaying for 5+ years, getting poor to little service in return, and a snotty attitude to boot!"
1,"For two weeks Comcast has been experiencing digital break-up on its NBC channel, both on HD and regular in our area. Again today on SUPER BOWL Sunday it was totally impossible to receive a signal. I called for the third time and waited 15 min. to speak to someone. That person could not give me any answers. I asked to speak to a supervisor. After another 5 minute wait I spoke to Andria in the Springfield Call Office. She also could not give me any satisfaction but did admit they had been having trouble for some time. She said the wait was due to the heavy call volume. She stated they had something that needed repair, indicating they did know of the problem before my call today. She said the best she could do is have someone from the local office call me Monday.The picture came on finally at 10:30 A.M., but was not of good quality. It was grainy while the other channels were OK. Comcast's customer service and picture quality has continuously declined since they took over from Insight. It is obvious they have a monopoly and do not care. As long as they get their fee they continue to provide questionable service. On this day I contacted 6 other cable subscribers in the area and they were experiencing the same problem. Comcast has eliminated their local phone contact and the only contact is through a 800 number. They do not return calls about programing or problems. Generally an I don't care attitude."
1,"I discontinued my cable service with Comcast in October 2008. I've called numerous times to get my refund of $37.38. It has been one person after another telling me that the check is in the mail, but as of 1-31-09, nothing has been received. I would like to know why it's so difficult for a company, such as Comcast to respect a previous customer's request for money owed to them. I just want what is due to me just as Comcast always wanted me to pay them in a timely manner."
1,"We buy cable TV from Comcast of Toms River, NJ. Our service does not include the digital package which costs more money. Over the last year Comcast has removed several channels from our package to digital without decreasing our monthly bill. Channels moved include STYLE. OXYGEN, HISTORY CHANNEL, CARTOON NETWORK, TRAVEL CHANNEL.  In fact, the cost has gone up over the last year."
1,"Ever since Comcast took over Insightbb here in northern Illinois, Internet and cable service has crap. I have a year's worth of random various test results other than typical speed tests demonstrating the issues I have been complaining to Comcast officials about their services. I am on a 16/2 plan and generally average 1/3 to 1/2 of ""rated tier"". Local HD channels are way over compressed and experience ""robot underwater"" sound. After initial contact with Frank ** and his right hand techie I have a post from Him and an email from tech William ** stating that we (Rockford) customers were being routed through a CMT server that we should not have been. That was about 7/31/2009 after going for 6 months posting PingPlotter results on my Dslreports.com review for Comcast. Well they finally fixed that issue; however, the DPI and protocol agnostic and Comcast's deceiving way of doing things Have still left service to be desired for the premium I have been faithfully paying. I can provide data and correspondence letter from latest Comcast official contact with my immediate response providing test results on Comcast's own server reputing what Joe ** Claimed. Filed report with Illinois State's attorney with sample test results. Contacted 2 elected State Officials about the same. Fixing to go to small claims."
1,"I'd like to know why I'm paying over 100 and some odd dollars to always have problem with this cable company, always have to get credit which is not much for the problem I'm always having. I've been with the company since it was District Cable Vision, never had a problem. Now that I switch to the digital box, I'm always having problems. They need to go down on the prices and instead of going up, please can someone give me a call to let me know."
1,"This company is ridiculously incompetent. I moved one apartment over and spent the next month trying to get Triple play service transferred over. After many phone calls and frustration, they finally transferred the service over only to continue to bill my old address as well. Then one month later, my new service quit working and the techs don't come at the time they promised (typical cable guy routine). They also stated that I had the old equipment from the old apartment (false). Getting angry doesn't work. To make them listen, I find, the only way to make them competent is to squeeze their ____ (excuse my language) - i.e., take action which can potentially damage the company and bring negative attention to them. Unfortunately, this is sometimes what it takes to make others listen after you have exhausted patience and tolerance. Others who have had negative experiences with Comcast, take action! Contact the BBB, attorney, whatever! but exercise your rights firmly."
1,The company raised my services by over $27/month since December. I understand rate increases but this is excessive and gouging. In current economic climate this only aggravates my level of stress!
1,I am writing that Comcast is always harassing customer for payments. If the payments are $90.00 or $130.00 or $95.00 they will turn off your service. They don't give people a chance or a break. They should understand and be patient with customers. Don't harass.
1,"Every month in the last year, we have had different payments due. When we call, some offer different rates/promotions so that you will not change your coverage. We were told that our price would be adjusted but were not told that it would only be for 3 months. When we asked why our bill went up $40.00 in one month, Chris said that the special promotion was over... They lie depending who you talk to. Our monthly payments range from $91.87 in Nov. a month to $147.61 February statement. Comcast seems to have the right to change statement rates for any reason based on who answers the phone. Monthly bills should not vary $55.00 for the same coverage."
1,"On 12/1/2008, I ordered service from Comcast. However, on 12/5/2008, I decided that I could not afford the service. Comcast owes me $163.95 which I have been trying to get back from them and they have not refunded my money that is owed to me. I have spoken to several representatives, who promised me that my check was mailed on 12/15/2008. As of 01/26/2009, I have received nothing from Comcast. Their phone # is 800 266-2278. I would appreciate any help you can assist in getting my money back."
1,"I cancelled my cable service a few months back to begin having services with AT&T around end of November, early December and I did not receive any bills and thinking everything was all taken care of with the ONE, I repeat, ONE box I had given back I received a collection notice in the mail stating I never canceled and I have TWO cable boxes outstanding on my account and I need to pay them a total of $471.03. I tried to speak with what I think may be a supervisor on 1-26-09, but I can not be certain. I told her what happened and she kept on denying I canceled and have given the boxes back... etc, etc. (She stated I did not call to cancel, when I know I did!) She told me I would have to show a receipt to prove myself. They have done this to me before in the past with an internet modem stating I never gave it back, when in fact I did. My account is now in collections and she state it will go on your credit report and people will continue to knock at your door. Nice and harassing huh? I am not sure what my next step is, but they can be certain they are not going to charge me $300.00 for equipment I returned along with 2 months of cable that was supposed to be canceled."
1,The website for Comcast says to sign up for cable TV there is no charge. I have a screenshot saved. When I did an online chat they repeatedly would not give any prices and just tried to get me to call. This is in clear violation of your 2006 agreement with Comcast.
1,"They added $6.00 additional fee for HD service to 2 HD boxes ($12.00 per month total) that we have been paying $8.00 per month for from the time we started the service (over 2 years). There was no notice of change, no reason that there should be added cost to supply HD Service to HD Boxes installed. Rep said it was a result of an audit they did in Sept. '08 so it was prorated and subsequent credits/debits made to correct the error. We have never requested, or had, any changes to our service. We have paid the same amount every month from the beginning. Now, although they say they are charging us $12.00 additional each month, the monthly billing has increased by only $3.00. I suspect another audit soon. My question as to how they could conceivably charge to provide service in addition to the cost of the of the box was never answered."
1,"Comcast (again!) is raising rates and deleting services. Am on the phone with Dan (1/24/09, about 3:58 pm). No longer have local on-demand channel, suddenly taken away with no notice. Have checked bills, nothing listed. Getting rid of on-demand channels to free-up bandwidth on Comcast system. Implemented one month early with ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE, but quick to include rate increase! Can the government start to control this ridiculous behavior, now that we have someone normal in the presidency? When is Comcast going to be held accountable for their deceptive practices?"
1,"Over a period of at least six months, I continue to get charged for a service I never heard of and never requested. This service is called blast and a $10.00. Charge appears under the internet part of my bill. I have asked that this service be removed as not wanted and Comcast tells me they coded it off the bill and it appears again. Now I'm threatened with service shut off for this fictitious $10.00 charge. The state of New Jersey Consumer Affairs has been placed on notice and I informed Comcast of this as well."
1,"On the evening of January 22 our cable and internet went out. When I called Comcast I was told be the operator that she would send a signal to our box and that I was to wait 5-10 minutes and my service should be restored. After about 15 minutes I called back, the second operator told me that our service had been disconnected outside and that we would have to contact the local office during normal business hours the next day.On the morning of January 23 (today) we called back. With our first call we were on hold for 40 minutes waiting for an operator. We stayed on that line waiting and used another phone to call in. We got an operator within 10 minutes. We told her our situation and she did some trouble shooting. She also told us our service is not disconnected, and that it doesn't say that anywhere on the account. She could not get the service restored and told us that she could have a tech come out in 4 days (Tuesday). It's Friday morning and we cannot go the whole weekend without service.I told her that was unacceptable. This is their equipment we are renting and our bill is paid every month. If they are too busy with technical problems they need to get some more people in and get this taken care of. She tried to contact dispatch, but could not get a hold of anyone (again do they completely under-staff every department?). We are now waiting 20 minutes in for a call back, within 30 minutes, to see if they can get someone out here before the 4-day time period to fix or replace their faulty equipment."
1,"I moved from South Jersey to North Jersey in November and I was informed that as long as I get triple play at my new residence, I would not be charged the $150 term fee. My account has now been sent to collections even though I have spent numerous hours on the phone explaining this situation. Everyone at Comcast agrees with me but no one will help me. As requested, I have sent copies of my new Comcast statements showing that I have the bundle package and still no response."
1,"Getting my emails to show are extremely slow, not to mention weather on there is not my local weather, closest was Hershey. I still can't access my account info for Comcast view bill."
1,"On December 29th, I called Comcast to transfer my business service (cable/phone/internet) from **, West Long Branch, NJ to **, Monmouth Beach, NJ. To date, I still don't have service. I spoke with 4 people on the 29th. The fourth person gave me the original number to call. I refused to start over again after having been on the phone for 90 minutes. Marie ** is the name of the person who finally was able to take the information and make the transfer. It took 10 days for Comcast to survey the area to see if they could provide service at the new location. At that point, Marie told me I had to sign a new contract which she mailed to my home. On January 12th, I signed the new contract and returned it to her priority mail. On Friday, January 16th, she was to call me with an installation date. On Tuesday, January 20th, I called her again looking for the date. My daughter/partner left a message with her supervisor asking for assistance. He did not return our call. Marie called me today, January 21st, and told me that the contract I mailed was dated January 14th and it arrived on her desk today, January 21st. She then informed me that the request had to be sent to verification. I asked how long that would take and she claimed a few hours. She then informed me that our December bill was outstanding and I should call Billing to pay the bill because they might refuse to install my new service because of the outstanding balance. I explained the reason the bill wasn't paid was because they had not installed our internet service, but that I would call and pay it by phone with a credit card. Upon attempting to do that, I was told that they didn't have access to my account and could not complete the transaction. I then asked how I could get credit for the time service was not provided. I was told that my account was active and they could not give me credit for the 21 days to days I have not been provided service. I am unable contact another company for service because Comcast has us tied into a contract. If we break the contract, we will be fined."
1,"I am having problems where Comcast is saying I'm ordering PORN when I am not at home. This month $116.00 worth of porn. This past Sunday they told me at 1:21pm, I ordered porn at $11.99 per movie. I was not at home at that time. I was at my mother's and my daughter was at her boyfriend's house. I told them there was no one home and they said they do not want to hear it. I have to pay it. I owe Comcast for this month $278.00. Last month I got a bill for $248.00. I called and they said they were taking off 6 porn movies that I was charged for for this bill. I was charged for Dec. 15, 16, 18, 24 (what everyone does after church), 29, Jan. 2, 9, 15, 16 and 18. I work in the afternoon and my sixteen year old daughter is at school when they are saying we are watching these movies."
1,"Last week, Comcast workers came to our housing development regarding a leakage in our units and had to check out each one. So in doing so, I asked when the people in our town are going to get HD/On Demand as per their ads on TV. I was told by their customer service reps that they are upgrading as soon as we can but the service worker told me that Comcast had no intent of upgrading three towns in our county (Rochester, Monaca and Freedom) until late 2010. We are still paying the same as other towns that receive more channels/options that we ever receive. Isn't this false advertising?"
1,"Our basic cable television service is provided through our Homeowners Association dues. Recently, I upgraded the Comcast service for an additional $26.00 per month so as to obtain HD channels. I have experienced intermittent and frequent interruption of HD service because of audio and visual lock-up. The picture and audio momentarily freeze. I have placed numerous service calls with respect to this issue, and have experienced incompetent and unscrupulous technicians. I was even charged a service call fee for Customer Education, which took many phone calls and escalation efforts on my part to get the fee reversed.The problem still exists, and the only way I have been able to deal with it has been to unplug and reboot the converter box. I am hesitant to request another service call to the house for fear of being billed. This company is too big and seems to respond to customers in an unethical manner. We have been paying for a service for several months now but have not realized the full benefit, as promised by Comcast. The issue is still unresolved."
1,"In August, we purchased land and hired a contractor to build for us a new home. In December, when the home was ready, we moved into it and put our old home on the market. Previously, we had the Comcast package for Digital Cable, Internet and Phone Service. We called Comcast on December 8th and arranged for them to transfer our account from our old home to our new home, making sure that they understood that we want all three services and wanted to retain our old phone number. After trying to convince us that it was ""impossible"" for us to retain our old phone number, they eventually said they could do it. We set up an appointment for a Comcast Cable employee to come to our house to install these services....and he/she never showed up. We called them again, spoke to a different representative who did not provide us with a confirmation number and claimed that we were not in their system and they have no knowledge of our appointment inquiry for transferring the services to our new home. They then sent another person to our home to do a ""survey"" to see if our home was suitable for their services in late December. He set us up for another appointment to have someone install the services on January 12th. We were on vacation at the time but our children were home. They were informed of the cable man's expected arrival and were instructed to open up for him so that he could install the services. We even gave Comcast my son's cell phone number so that he could be contacted to confirm the appointment. On January 12th, my son waited all day and no one from Comcast called or came to the home. When we returned from vacation, we called Comcast and they said that they sent someone who rang the doorbell and no one answered. He then called the cell phone number on his work order and left a message. After checking with my son, we found out that this was a lie. No one came to the home and there were no voice mail messages or missed calls on his phone to indicate that someone called. We called Comcast AGAIN on January 14th. At this point, my son had just begun Web Programming courses at College and required internet access to do his assignments. We needed internet ASAP and this work order was requested on December 8th. It has now been over one month. We called Comcast yet again. They sent someone and promised to have the services installed that day. When the Comcast guy arrived, he claimed to have run some wires to all the rooms but was unable to do any installations because the person who came to do the survey did not indicate that the wires from the telephone pole going to the home had to be set up. He left without installing the services. We called Comcast again and told them about what their employee told us and they said that it was a problem with the street wires and that the Philadelphia Electric Company had to come out and repair the lines before they could do work. We checked with PECO, and they said that nothing was wrong. We called the contractor who built the house and he told us that all the wires were set up and were installed underground going to the home. All Comcast had to do was come over and install the services. After much persuasion from my irate husband, we spoke to a Comcast Services Manager. We threatened to cancel their services and go with Verizon after we've been with Comcast for over 5 years. The manager's response was ""That's OK. Go ahead."" Later we spoke to someone else who promised that they would send someone to install the services between 9-11 am on January the 17th. We waited until 2:30 pm; no one arrived. We called to check again, providing them with the confirmation number and they said he was on his way and would be at our home in 45 minutes. Still no one arrived. Finally, at 5:30 pm, someone did show up and did the work.This has been the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. I have no idea how Comcast manages to stay in business with such poor service. Every time we spoke to one of their employees, they gave us a different story about why we could or couldn't have the installation completed. I couldn't imagine anyone could possibly run a business this way."
1,"The cable goes off every time it is windy. I got a DVR box less than a year ago and now it is broken. I have to go to Beverly to get another. I am 80 years old. Why do I have to get HBO so that I can get the mystery channel? They never tell you when they have new products to replace the ones you have so I am paying for things I don't have like outdated boxes and remotes. With the old cable company, we used to get a program telling what is on for the month but not anymore. We used to have an office in Gloucester, not anymore! We are paying more for less. There is no competition because they are the only game in town."
1,"This Comcast Sales rep, David **, sells me an offer - $33.00 Cable for 12 months ($100.00 mail-in rebate) and Internet $19.99 for 6 months ($75.00 mail-in rebate). I filled up the application form at the Walmart store (in San Jose where he held this special promotional offer) on 10/01/2009. He said a tech guy would come on Tuesday, 13/01/2009, if not earliest. No one showed up until Thursday... and I called up this David guy and left a zillion messages. He never called me back. So, on Thursday, this Tech guys shows up and tells me that he has work order only for cable and no Internet.After I make a request to him to check back if he can set up Internet connection, he tells me that he can either setup Internet at $19.99 for 3 months or $24.99 for 6 months. I go for former, and immediately he changes his stance and tells me that he can do the $24.99 for 6 months only and there would be just a total of $100.00 mail-in rebate and nothing else. I would have gone with this offer, had he not changed his stance within a minute as this makes you feel cheated. I couldn't believe Comcast guys could be so very unprofessional, and so very unresponsive."
1,Comcast has raised our cable TV rate from $52.04 in Nov. to $56.04 in Jan. and I believe that they intend to raise rates again. What are people doing? We need you to stop these increases.
1,"I was just reading the other complaints and basically second them. I have had several issues with both my cable (more specifically, the 'on demand' feature) and my internet. On Demand - works fine in one room (most of the time) but doesn't let me use it most of the time on our other TV box in the second room. I have had Comcast over several times but they cannot fix it, and they usually respond with the same comment: ""This happens at my home too, sometimes; it will stop.""Our Internet goes out several times a week (almost daily, as of late), and each time, it's blamed on our router or computer, but that is impossible, as when I switch to a neighbor's Wi-Fi, I have no problem at all. I am just tired of companies taking advantage. We pay a lot of money for cable/internet/phone, and for them to blow it off really bothers me. I really want something done about these companies that continuously provide poor service."
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for several years now. I called to make my monthly $120.00 payment for internet and cable with Showtime. I was offered their new Triple Play bundle for the same price, and this includes a phone, which I really don't need because we both have cellphones, and HBO/Starz. Now, because it was the same price and I really didn't need the phone, but I would take the HBO/Starz if they're not going to bill me anymore than what I currently pay, then I took it.We spoke for over half-an-hour to make sure that the Showtime would be included, because that's the only premium channel I watch my shows on and I didn't want to lose that. I also verified the phone could accept collect calls since it is not a regular phone, and my friend said there were issues with the collect calls because of cable phone service. After about half-an-hour of trying to figure it, the sales rep assured me about the collect calls and that because Showtime was the determining factor in me taking the bundle, that he got it included with it. This was in November.In December, I got a bill with extra installation charge for the phone and a new modem, along with an extra $18.99 for Showtime itself. I understand the one-time installation, but I got online and the Comcast chat rep went ahead and reversed the $18.99. Now, again, this month, I got another $18.99 for Showtime, so I contacted them again. This time, the chat rep said it isn't part of the offer, but they can give me Showtime for $6.99 for the next six months. This was unacceptable, so I called Comcast (since chat reps and phone reps don't have the same capabilities). The rep stated Showtime is not part of the package, and they cannot make it part of the package either. I then spoke to a supervisor, who basically said that sometimes, when someone wants something, that they tend to hear that they got it, and that even if their rep did promise this, that they are correcting the issue now, and for the future, they will offer again the $6.99 Showtime for six months.So now I have paid the installation fee of $29.99 for the phone I only took because the offer included Showtime, and now I'm stuck paying for Showtime, which I already had for the same price in my last package, minus the headache."
1,"I asked Comcast if I could reduce my services with the company. I have a bundle package which includes Cable, phone and Internet. The company said that I would be able to adjust the package to a price I would be able to afford but they will charge me a $150 cancellation fee. I was not canceling their service, I only needed a better-priced plan. Is this legal?"
1,"The community in which I live, includes the cable TV service in the monthly homeowner's dues. I have lived here for 19 years. In Nov. 2008, I began receiving erroneous cable bills from COMCAST. I consequently called and was told to ignore the bill because it should have never been generated. In Dec. 2008, I received another bill. I wrote to COMCAST and told them again that I did not owe the amount, because it was included in my homeowner's dues. I also, told them if I received another bill, I would file a complaint. Yesterday, I received another bill. I don't know what else to do - since talking and writing doesn't seem to resolve the situation. Thank you."
1,We called about getting HD in our area; we're told they aren't planning on offering it. They won't update their equipment. They are the only game in town unfortunately.
1,"I called in reference to my internet access modem hook-up which would be the dual computer section. She said it was in the locked out state whether that was true or not. I was hooked up through Insight on a package deal with my television and cable long before Comcast took over here in Bloomington, Indiana. Most of the clients here with the said company are unhappy with this take over for they even had taken off some television channels without informing the public that they can do this so called business. I'm not a hundred percent computer literate person but, when and if I go on my computer, which is daily, I wish to be able to enjoy it without any problems - the same thing with my TV."
1,"I started my service on 7-9-08 with Comcast. I cancelled the service on 7-19-08 and was sent a bill for $367.27. Since then, I have received numerous bills with various different amounts owned and when I called each time to find out what I owed, no one could ever tell me exactly what I owed or why I even owed. I get a different amount and different story each time I call. Since then, Comcast has sent me to a collection agency, which has negatively impacted my credit score. According to my calculations, I have overpaid Comcast. I don't know when or how to even begin to get my money back, not to mention the time and headaches. In addition to my billing problem, following are letters and emails that I wrote/sent to several executives and NEVER received a response: I wanted to tell you how disappointed I am with Comcast service (or lack thereof) and will be cancelling my service immediately upon finding a new provider. Let's begin with my installation where your sub fell through my ceiling. A week later with a hole still in my ceiling, after my A/C ran non-stop to cool my bedroom and attic, after sleeping in a bed with my 13-year old son and being on hold for over an hour, Comcast sent someone out to repair my ceiling. The ceiling repair was cheaply done and not done correctly. I have taken pictures for documentation. As if this has not been enough, the balance from the previous person that had the phone number Comcast assigned to me has been transferred to my account. It is over $500 and I've only had your service for a few weeks! I talked to a supervisor today that informed me she could not help me and that I would need to contact customer service to get this resolved. She said she was unable to transfer me, but gave me the phone number to call. The phone number I was given was 713-462-9700, which is a fax! I have the phone conversation recorded (I've learned I have to do this when speaking to anyone at Comcast) to verify my conversation. I have names and dates of every person I have spoken to during this nightmare. I have a 13-year old son that was recently diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease (a form of cancer) and one of his wishes was for me (his mother - a single parent) to get internet. I have enough to deal with right now and don't need this added frustration nor do I have the time.Through numerous conversations, I have found out that most people I talked to have had a bad experience with Comcast. Comcast has a horrible reputation and that's very unfortunate. I will continue to tell others about this experience in an effort to save them time and frustration. I suggest you seriously make a change in personnel and training if you want to keep customers. With other providers like AT&T offering similar if not better service, this is a change you better make quickly! I almost have no sanity left and I need help! If there is anyone that can help me, I would greatly appreciate it."
1,"Since last winter (early 2008), I have had problems with my Comcast Cable and internet service. The signal is very low and this causes the television screen to have poor reception and the internet signal to drop. Since about 2 months ago, I have gotten more assertive in trying to get the issues resolved - before that, I would call the Service Line. If Comcast was able to send through a stronger signal remotely, the issues seemed to clear up for a few days at a time. Since this fall, however, that approach no longer works. Since about October 2008, I always have ongoing issues with my internet and cable service. I have had 4 service calls from Comcast, and countless calls to the Service Center... all to no avail. Twice I have been told that a 'supervisor' would call me within 48 hours because they recognized that my ongoing issues with cable and internet signal strength were not being resolved. No Supervisor ever called back, despite 4 calls that I made back into Comcast to remind them that I was waiting on a supervisor call. Every time a technician comes out, they claim that 'the last guy' didn't diagnose and fix the problem correctly, but that they have now fixed the issue. This is never the case. Within 24-48 hours of their visit, the cable is failed again. Apparently, several people in my building have been having the same issues, but Comcast refuses to deal with any of us on a building-wide level. I guess it's just easier to string us along as individuals!! I cannot WAIT for any other cable provider to come in this part of the District so that Comcast loses all the customers like myself that they have mistreated so badly!For months and months I have been trying to get a credit for poor Comcast cable and internet service -- but Comcast always claims that they do not put the credits through until the problem is resolved. Well, since Comcast has not resolved the issues for months, there is no credit!! Actually, after much arguing with Comcast, I finally got one woman in Customer Service to put through a partial credit, just in recognition of the issues that I had all winter/summer/fall of 2008. However, it was VERY CLEAR at the time that the problems were not yet fixed, and that the credit she was putting through then were reflective of issues I'd been having since May 2008 -- and that the dates of the first credit were not meant to be all inclusive. I was also told at the time that when/if the issues were fully resolved that Comcast would credit me for the remaining time that the cable and internet were not working properly. Now, however, when I enquire about that Comcast points back to the first credit and say that I have 'already' been credited for the issue up through a certain date. This is an outrage."
1,"They will not refund my $546 that they debited from my account in error. I had automatic debit for my monthly Comcast bill. One month, instead of debiting my account for $79, they debited my account for $790. I called them and was told that I would receive a refund for the difference. Well of course, no refund ever arrived. I had the service for another 3 months and then I moved out of state. Still no refund. I changed my address on the account to make sure they had the new address. Still no refund.Every time I call the billing department, they look it up, put me on hold and after 5-10 minutes they come back and say that they are processing the refund and I will receive a check in 4 to 6 weeks. This has been going on since June of 2006. I keep calling and same thing, time after time. I tell them that I keep being told the same thing over and over and no check ever arrives. Their answer is, this time, it is in process, it will positively be sent in 4-6 weeks.In November of 2008, I once again spoke with them after not receiving the check again and I was told that the check had been cut and was either mailed on November 4th or 6th. I should be receiving it within a week. I called back on November 17th and was told the check had been sent, give it another week or so... Well of course, no check. I verified the address they had was correct and it was... No check...Now I called on January 8th, 2008 and I was told that the prior people who told me the check had been sent were wrong, it was just in processing for the check to be cut and... you guessed it... it would be 4 to 6 weeks before I would see it. I inquired as to why it would be another 4 to 6 weeks if the processing was entered into on November 4th. He said he did not know, but that is what he was told.So I sent an email using the customer service complaint form. I got a response back within 24 hours. They told me they were sorry and they would expedite the matter... and... it would be... you guessed it, 4 to 6 weeks. I sent one back telling them that that was unacceptable and I wanted someone to contact me by phone who was a supervisor. So I sit and wait... The real kicker is that their records have shown the refund due the entire time and there has never been any question that they owe me the money. It is not even a question that it is owed."
1,"Today is a very special day for my husband and I. We had gone out to dinner for about an hour and a half. We are both very big college football fans and of course could not wait to see the biggest college game of the season, the Championship game between Oklahoma and Florida. We left our house at approx. 6pm to go to eat - as I said, we were gone about an hour and a half. We left our TV on the Fox Channel (the network which carried the game) so that as soon as we walked in the door, we would be instantly in the latter part of the pre-game. When we left, the TV/cable was working perfectly. My husband went up the stairs first upon arrival home and said there is a problem with the TV/cable. The screen was black with a message in blue that said the channel wasn't available but would be momentarily. The same message was on every channel. We waited a few minutes and nothing changed. My husband called Comcast and explained the problem in complete detail. The Comcast person said it must be the box and they would send a signal to it. The person said to wait 15 minutes and turn the box back on and everything should be fine. Well, we did as instructed and nothing changed. We waited about 20 more minutes and called back again. We went through the same procedures and again the cable did not work. We had tried turning off everything (the TV and the cable box) and turning it back on and nothing happened. Our son, who is a technical geek, who was not at home at the time, called and talked us through some things. When we tried to take the cable from the box to the TV directly, it was obvious the cable was out. Now mind you, Comcast had not let on a thing about any problems in our area on the two previous calls to them. Finally on the third call to Comcast, my husband said, “Look, you people keep saying it is the box when clearly it is not -- has there been an outage in our area tonight?” Then and only then did the Comcast employee let it slip that oh yes indeed there had been a problem earlier (reported by other customers in our area) and Comcast had dispatched a technician to work on the problem and had closed out the ticket. Clearly, he/she did not check to make sure every customer in our area was working. The Comcast employee said they would try to get the technician back out tonight (it is almost midnight and no technician or service) or it would be MAYBE tomorrow. I felt that we were deceived to say the least when Comcast clearly knew there had been a problem in our area earlier this evening. At this point, I was not a happy camper. I called Comcast to inquire as to the name and address of the president of Comcast so that I could write him a letter. I was not rude. When I requested the information, the Comcast employee hung up on me. I called back again and was given only a number (no name or address of the Comcast president) and was told the number went directly to Philadelphia (or Pittsburgh). When I called the number, the recording said that they could not take my call due to the high volume of calls and to call back another time -- then the line went dead. This pathetic excuse for service is beyond the pale. We have had other issues with Comcast and I have never complained. Tonight was, as the saying goes, ""the straw that broke the camel's back."" If Comcast had not jerked us around, they could have gotten the technician back out in time for us to have seen most of the game. As I write this, we have no service and did not see the game. Can something be done to Comcast to make them provide better service?"
1,"On 12/23/08, I called Comcast in reference to having my services transferred to my new address. The date was for 12/28/08 and shut off at my old address on 12/29/08. Due to my settlement date being changed, I called Comcast back on 12/26/08, to reschedule another date. This is when I found out that the transfer was not in the computer at all and the rep had to give me another date which was Jan. 6 2009, in which it would leave me without cable, phone and internet services for a week. This was one of my inconveniences; however it gets worse. On 12/28/08, I come home from Church to find out Comcast had shut off my telephone services due to my prior arrangement that the rep. stated was not in the computer at all. Trying to get professional help with Comcast is ridiculous. I finally have my services on; however, I had 2 phone #. One is my primary number. The second # is connected to my Arris Modem. Well, when they turned my services back on, they switched my lines which was another inconvenience, so I had to call back to resolve that issue. After all that, on 12/29/08, they disconnected my services again. Now I'm frustrated because I have to get back on my cell phone and be charged to call Comcast and be patient and work with them to get my services restored. On 12/30/08, I called and had all transferred services that I had ordered to be on hold until I call them back, which went very well. On 12/31/08, Comcast disconnected all my services again. So I had to call Comcast again. With all this being said, my bill was due on 12/25/08, and not one Comcast rep stated anything to me about my bill being late. On 1/2/08, I paid $185.29 through my online bill pay w/ my bank to Comcast. On 1/3/08, my services were interrupted due to my bill not being paid. I never received a shut off notice due to the payment being 9 days late.For an entire week, I was on the phone with Comcast and no one said a thing about my payment. On 1/3/08 the Comcast rep was very nasty and demanded that I pay the total today in order for my services to be restored. I told her I had paid a payment on 1/2/08, and I also asked why they would just interrupt my services without sending me a notice. She stated ""that's a courtesy and they don't have to notify you"". I have never heard of such. Well that's not the end. I paid the balance on my account to get services restored, thinking I could stop payment on the payment done with online billing; however, I was mistaken. Because it was electronically done, I could not put a stop payment on it. So, Comcast got paid twice. Calling trying to get my money back is a pain in the you-know-what. During the process, I have had Comcast reps hang up and being unprofessional with attitudes, and few that were nice and helped me through the process. Comcast can inconvenience the customer all day long and we just pay the bill, but when we owe them money, they cut us off for late payment of 9 days. Trying to get my money back is going to take 3-4 days and they said I might not get a full refund, because if I have a balance and I do because of how their billing system is, they will take my money and pay towards that which is not fair, since that bill is not due until 1/25/09. I'm so tired of Comcast and the BS!!!!! Verizon is looking real good."
1,"We were moving and I scheduled a transfer of service in the beginning of December 2008. We were moving across town. I contacted them and scheduled the day we were moving. However, the previous owners of the house had not canceled yet. We were told that it was no problem and when their service was disconnected, we would be reconnected and our service would not be interrupted. Well, the previous owners canceled their service on the 30th of December (due to they needed to keep accessing their Comcast email). On the 31st, a truck came out and disconnected the service. I called up. I was told that there was no reconnect order. They saw the transfer but it never went through. I would have to wait until the 6th to have my phone, internet, and cable TV reconnected (the earliest they could get out there). I argued with them and got a service order (or so I thought). They sent a truck out to my previous address to disconnect me... no reconnect. On the 6th, I was working in an area with no cell signal so I could not get a call. When I was able to check my voice mail, there was a speed message stating that someone would be at my house between 1 and 4. Nice to know, but my wife starts work at 4 and had to pick my son up from school. So I leave work early. The tech gets there at about 2:45 and my wife has to leave at 3:00. Oh, and they are there to Install not reconnect me. Apparently, my old number does not exist (I cannot call my voice mail or even check my email). I have NOT cancelled server (YET). I get there at 3:10 and he's gone because no one is there. SO instead of making things right and getting someone back out to my house, I now have to wait another 3 days to get it connected. I'll believe it when I see it.If you use Comcast, do not ever change your service. They will never be able to make it right. If you are thinking of Comcast, use someone else. They have terrible internal communication skills and cannot think outside the box to help you. This is unreal when you have to wait nearly two weeks to get your service turned back on from a mistake that they made."
1,"In Dec. 08, I spoke with a representative over the phone and agreed to a promotional package that I was told would lock my price in at 60 dollars. One month later, I received a bill for 116 dollars. When I called and told Keisha what had happened, she totally ignored the fact that I was quoted and had paid for the service at the previous price. I had to discontinue the service since Comcast committed what amounts to fraud. Where's the FCC? They're still allowing the cable companies to commit modern day armed robbery!!!!!!!! "
1,"It has been over 2 years since Comcast told me they would bury my cable. The worst part is that a Mr. Detreon **, Executive Escalations Specialist, contacted me and told me he would get the cable underground for me. I did tell him I didn't think he could since I have been trying for over two years. He only contacted me after I posted a complaint online. Mr. ** stayed in contact with me and on October 31, 2008, he sent me a letter that stated that on October 25, 2008, a construction team coordinator visited my area to remove the disputed cable (I did not request the cable be removed, but put underground).Just to make sure I was not seeing things, I asked my wife and children to verify that the yellow cable was still in the same place it has been for OVER TWO YEARS! Mr. ** letter also stated that if he could be of further assistance to contact him at 1-888-610-0995. I have left 5 messages for him without a return call. As soon as AT&T comes to my area, Comcast will be history. Don't you just love this industry?"
1,"Television ad was for $10/mo. x 12 mos. and $20 installation fee. I confirmed on 10/23 on the phone with Comcast. After 4 attempts and some no shows, cable was finally installed, but bills read $25.99 installation fee (x1) and $18.49 month. I paid the 1st bill and enclosed a letter regarding fee. The 2nd bill came with same monthly overcharge. I had no luck on phone with supervisor (who is in Mexico). He can't do anything about it, he said."
1,"I have cable TV with Comcast because it is the only cable TV company available at my location. I added 1 month free trial offer from Comcast for cable on computer and on telephone (AT&T). AT&T would not allow Comcast to install on telephone for which I am very happy. Comcast Cable never worked on my computer and only caused problems. I called and cancelled Comcast and they made an appt. to disconnect on Jan. 2, but they never showed up. I called Comcast to inquire and they reset the date for disconnect on 1/12. Meanwhile, I have received a billing in the amount of $70.00 which I will not pay. Telephoning Comcast now gets me put on hold and left there while they add up charges. I also hear 2-way conversations with Comcast employees while waiting and waiting for response.This experience with Comcast has been most upsetting and has caused me to get insomnia and headaches and elevated blood pressure. And online with AOL, I have very limited usage since I don’t have a password (according to them) to be an “administrator”. I have used the same password for many years, but they say it is the wrong one and I can't use it. I am 81 years old and I consider this elderly abuse by Federal guidelines."
1,"We bought a HD TiVo box that required a cable card that Comcast had to issue. When I called to get the card, I told them that I did not have our old cable box anymore. Comcast quickly told me that they would still charge me for the box even if we didn't use it (i.e., we weren't allowed to return it). I reminded them that the FCC had an agreement with the cable companies where the cable companies would provide one card for free to consumers. By charging me for a box we won't use, they are charging me for the card which seems illegal.I wish that was the end. After a technician came, he tried to convince us to let him take the box since we wouldn't need it knowing we would still have to pay for it. That was easy to deal with but when he was done, he said the cable card was working fine and left. When we turned on our TV, the card wasn't initialized or paired so we had no signal. After 3 days of phone calls to Comcast with each rep telling us the card was fine, we still have no TV. We are now waiting for a rep to come to our home which won't happen for at least 2 days. Oh, and I almost forgot; the rep scratched our new Ethan Allen entertainment center."
1,"Cable TV service in my area has had intermittently poor picture quality on most channels for the past week. The automated phone announcement acknowledges a problem in my area. The phone idiot I spoke with insulted my intelligence with her lack of education and communication skills. She kept insisting that I check my indoor connection which, for me, is an elementary exercise that I had already done. Comcast is an arrogant monopoly that feels no obligation to give satisfactory service to paying customers. They should be taken over and regulated."
1,"On August 16, 2008, I ordered the Triple Play. It had a rebate of 225 dollars. The rebate company is Bridgevin, 1-888-314-9903. They said that I would receive it in 10 weeks and now it is 5 months later and I still have not received it. I call all the time and they said it is still being processed."
1,I called to disconnect my services and she said she couldn't because I have a balance. I asked her to bill me; she said that she could not disconnect. I am moving and I don't need the services anymore. I explained after waiting to be helped for 2 hours on hold! I don't think it’s fair that I will continue to get billed when I asked them to disconnect. I just want the service to get disconnected immediately.
1,"I had told Comcast that I no longer wanted my bill paid directly through my bank account because they were always withdrawing too much ($150 when I only authorized $110). I went online to my bank and cancelled the automatic payments. However, on 12/31/08, Comcast still withdrew money from my account without my permission. As a result, my account was overdrawn and I am being charged late fees. Additionally, I have had to cancel the account that they had unauthorized access to and open a new account which I was, once again, charged fees for. "
1,"I live in an HUD Senior Citizen apartment building managed by Catholic Charities of West Palm Beach. Yesterday, the cable service was switched to Comcast at a price almost triple what I have been paying. The residents of this bldg have no say in the transfer. The picture is of very poor quality. The service we were receiving was sufficient, but when it stormed, we would lose the connection temporarily. Management of this facility could care less if the results of their decisions put a burden on the residents. It seems to me that our income is a factor as to rate increases of any kind. Please have the service corrected or return to previous provider."
1,In feb.0f 2007 I opened an account with comcastcast cable triple play package. I received a letter to sign dated 9-05-07. I never signed it. I called the number on the bottom of the letter and the man said I did not have too for if I dident it would just go from 24 months to 12 months. now I am trying to movie and they want to hit me with a termination fee saying that I signed an agreement when I dident. I than faxed them a copy of the unsigned agreement and all of a suddent they said now that I signed it on line and I will be charged.I am so stessed out I go to bed with chest pains
1,"I've been waiting a long time for the roll out of new HD channels in my area including HDCNN. I finally got them earlier this month. YEAH! Oops now they are gone. When I asked why, after wading through the prerequisit 5 people who only know how to read a script or transfer you to someone else, I was told by a supervisor that the rollout of enhanced HD service to my area was a mistake and I would get them back at some future date. So there you have it, if your service improves it may well be a mistake that Comcast will correct.Very frustrated with a company that describes an increase of service as a mistake. Many surrounding areas are recieving the service upgrade, but for reasons that have not been explained by the company, our area is getting shortchanged for now."
1,Shame on me for paying my bills and not looking them over.  I called 12/29/08 to find out what a digital outlet charge of $6.95 on my bill was.  The lady who answered the phone had to put me on hold 3 times and came back each time and told me it that I had a digital outlet and couldn't explain what that was.  She finally handed me to a supervisor who informed me that because I have more than one TV with a HDTV converter on one and a DVR on another I am paying $6.95 per month for the cable to be taken to 2 different TV's.  I told the man that one line comes into my home and that the house was already wired for cable when I bought it.  He acknowledged that I was correct but they are providing service to more than one TV so I am charged a digital outlet fee of $6.95 per month.  Now I think this is a joke.  I am paying for the cable HDTV converter per month and the DVR per month.  I already pay extra to have the digital service and the devices that are suppose to supply the service.  Plus the digital signal comes from the cable coming into my home not from a split wire that goes to another TV.  They have recently raised their rates again $9.50 per month.  They are the only cable company in my city.  This is extremely ridiculous. They have taken away channels and haven't replaced them.  There are blue channels on at least 2 of the channels we have as you cannot have more than one of the same etc.  They move channels to higher channels so you have to pay to get what was once considered basic.  They have a monoply and competition needs to be brought in.  More than one cable company per city should be the norm.  They shouldn't be allowed to be the only game in any town.
1,"Moving with Comcast Cable Services was a disaster from day 1.   First for 20 days - I did not get all the channels that I had requested. Mainly I could not view any of the HD channels. Comcast representative told me that I will get a credit of 43$ for not getting the service and that they will send a technician to fix the issue. What they did not tell me is that they will charge me 24.95$ for sending the technician. I still don't understand why I should be paying $24.95 for something comcast technician (the one who installed the service) [messed] up in the first place.  Second Issue - tired of the issues with Comcast cable - I asked for removal of service - starting November 22nd, 2008. I was told that I should return the equipment with 14 days- so I did return the cable box on December 5th (13th day- still counts to be on time). Now I see a charge for Cable Services between Nov 22nd to December 5th on my bill. None of the representatives are willing to help me understand or waive the stupid charges made for service I did not get.No physical damage, but definitely a lot of mental stress and dissatisfaction."
1,"The wiring on my home was incorrect.  There are wires wrapped around the front of my home which in violation with my homeowners association.  I get the runaround from Comcast because they say that they didn't do the work, an outside contractor did.  I don't care if Moses did it.  Comcast needs to correct it or find someone to correct it for them.  A supervisor was sent to our home and took pictures.  He promised to call me back and that was 9 days ago.  The consequences are a fine by my homeowners association."
1,I have been getting charged for x-rated movies for over a year and a half. When I first quesitoned the bill they told me that there was another person in the area with the same name and the charges were going on my bill. They told me to just pay the bill minus the movie charges. Well now that I have moved into a different house the charges are continuing! I called again and now they tell me that the bill is based on ss # not name and they are trying to make me pay this bill!I removed the cable box that they say the movies are being bought from and returned it to the comcast office. Well miraculously there are 3 new charges for movies coming from the other cable box in the living room. 
1,"since the beginning of the summer, comcast has been putting hundreds of dollars in completely fabricated fees on my bill each billing period. i have spent over eleven hours on the phone fighting with them. for the purpose of this complaint i will focus on the most recent issue.     i thought i finally cleared up the problem at the end of november.i have a bill from comcast for the period of 11/3/08 through 12/3/08 that says, amount due- NONE. incredibly, when i got my bill for december, the amount was for $340.00. this is obviously not possible, as my monthly charges are about $95.00. i sent them a copy of the november bill as proof, and got no response. i made several addition phone calls, each lasting about one hour. every time the customer service rep. told me the same thing. they cant find the reason for the additional $245.00 charge. the system is slow. they will have to get their supervisor to look at it and call me back. then they hang up and never call back. in addition to these people being completely incompetent, they are extremely rude. they hung up on me several times. some of the most recent offenders are, bernice employee id# f72, carona- r4k, marsha -ooa, roz - 9op, lori - 9be, laquica - 9nv.sometime during the battle over these bogus charges, comcast reported me to a collection agency. i'm pretty certain my credit has a mark on it now. besides that, i spent over eleven hours on the phone with them recently. this time is very valuable to me, as i am self-employed. each hour on the phone with them is basically an hour of pay lost."
1,"I was a customer of Comcast since 1995. In October of this year the management of my complex decided to have Verizon Fios boxes installed in all dwellings, Verizon then offered promotions to sign with them. I called Comcast to inquire about switching since they provided phone, internet, and cable, I wanted a smooth transition. i was told I did not have a contract and how to go about releasing my number to Verizon. On average my bill was over 200 dollars per month with Comcast. I switched to Veizon on Oct. 23, 2008, and now Comcast is billling me for an early temination fee. They state I have a contract until April 2008, even though I was told I did not and I really don't know what kind of contract since as I stated my bills averaged $210.00 per month. They will not listen to reason, first I was a good paying customer for 13 years in this complex and another 10 in another, Comcast was the only act in town. Now that we have a choice and managements wants all tenants to go with Verizon, Comcast is trying to squeeze every cent from the people that leave. I will never have their service again, and I am fighting the ETF, it is unjust!"
1,"We have no connectivity with our modem and have called Comcast twice to have them come and fix the issue. The first appointment was never officially made - even though it was confirmed on the phone call w ith my husband. The second call was claimed to have been made and the technician told Comcast that they attempted to call but never did. Stephen, my husband was up at 6 am waiting for Comcast and they never called nor came to the house....A Andy and Jeff/Joe - he did not know his name, claimed that the technician phoned and no one picked up the phone...This is one more account of how Comcast is very bad on the back-end. The first time they damaged my house my drilling wholes in my house that they did not want to fix..."
1,"Our highrise building contracts for basic cable services with Comcast Houston, so we get a bulk discount rate if we contract our individual units for premium packages. Comcast failed to give me the discount rate for our highrise building. When I learned - 2 years later - that I was erroneously charged the regular rate, I asked for a refund or credit. I was initially told I would receive a credit of 1,500.00. When the credit never appeared on my statement, I called and was told that because I called to follow up 2 months after the initial credit request, the credit had expired as unclaimed! Also, the 2 HD boxes delivered to my new unit in October never worked. I reported this problem twice. When I called the 3rd time, the rep told me he would credit me for my boxes not working on the 3 days I called, but not for the entire period of time that the boxes were not working. Comcast Houston is a monopoly that cheats customers out of money and service. Houston City Counsel has given Comcast the exclusive right to operate in Houston. I wonder if Houston City Counsel members get kickbacks from Comcast? Comcast has defrauded me out of about 2000.00."
1,"I moved and canceled my service at the old address and began it again at the new address.  I didn't receive a closing bill at the new address for a couple of months because it had to be forwarded (even though Comcast had my new address).  I paid the closing amount on 11/13/08 and then received a bill on 11/17/08 stating that it had been sent to collections.  They credited the payment ($81.11) to the new account instead of my old account. When I called and explained to them what happened, they refused to transfer the credit to the old account.  My current account is fully paid and has been since I opened it.  They have been applying the $81.11 credit to the new bill each month, but I have continued to pay the full amount of the bill allowing the credit to remain on the account.  They told me that I should just pay $81.11 less on my new bill and then pay the $81.11 to the old bill.  The problem is that if I do that, they will ruin my credit.Even though they have had the money in their account, they have reported it to credit bureaus.  I want my credit cleared since their company has had the money all along."
1,"I am being charged a years worth of x-rated movies that I never ordered. They say they credited some and I am responsible for the rest. I had a situation over the summer where I noticed upon changing channels an x-rated movie whould show up and if I changed channels it would be gone. I had a service call for this issue, was told there were no charges for any movies, they never heard of such a problem, they would investigate and get back to me. I heard nothing until I received a $600 bill mid November."
1,"I believe that comcast business practices are unethical. I have comcast tv, voice and internet only because I live in a condo and am unable to recieve the signal of Direct TV by way of direction. Anyway, they are charging for a technician to come out to your home when their services or equipement is a problem. When they installed my digital voice my phone line was out and dropping calls constantly. I finally called and they sent someone out. The guy adjusted the signal and on my next bill I was charged $19.99. I called customer service and she told me that because a tech came out I was charged. I told her that it would be different if I owned the equipment or the service but I am renting the equipment and paying a monthly fee for service. So why would I should I pay for a problem that comes from their equipment and service. That baffled me. She then told me they had a service contract that I could purchase to prevent charges and I'm like, why would I pay for a contract with equipment I don't own for a service that you are suppose to provide. I am already paying for that. She removed the charges but I think that something should be done about their deceptive and corrupt business practices."
1,"This summer I moved out of the country to New Zealand. I closed down my Comcast account before I moved. On August 29, two service techs came to my house. The first tech shut off service and collected all of my rented equipment. The second tech said he was supposed to collect the equipment, but noted that the first had taken everything. I am a good customer and always paid my bills on time. When I cancelled service, I was told I would get a refund for the month paid in advance. In New Zealand now, I get a bill for $31.30. I call Comcast and am told that I still have some equipment, which I do not as it was collected on the 29th of August. I am in New Zealand now, and obviously cannot show up at an office to complain and my receipts for the 29th are with my goods in public storage for two years. The representative is NICE and tells me that she will resolve the problem and that I should be getting my refund in the mail soon. The next thing that comes to my mail is a notice of overdue payment and that it will be forwarded to a collection agency, thus affecting my credit score in this tight economy - a disparate impact and easily provable harm (for those legally minded). As far as I knew, the case had been CLOSED and that I was going to get a refund. NO OTHER COMMUNICATION came my way to tell me that the situation remained unresolved. I called again on December 20 (and spoke to Maria and her supervisor, Keith) - tracking and was told that there is an inventory problem and that some of the equipment is unaccounted for - hence the charge remaining on the bill. I cannot control the company's inventory problems or if some tech has your gear in the trunk of his car, and I RESENT the fact that Comcast is holding my credit score for ransom of $31.30.."
1,"I called comcast on 12-17-08 at 7:17 pm to request information regarding my account. I spoke with a very nice young man who when asked the location of the call center he informed me that that it is in Mexico. I asked New Mexico. He said not New Mexico, Mexico. I said you speak english very well. He said where he lives the children are transported by bus to schools in California and that is where he learned to speak english so well. How can we be sure we are buying american services if companies do not let us know that they have offices outside of the country. I am sure every comcast customer would be interested to know comcast, with the economy the way it is, would rather open offices just outside our country with no regard for out of work americans desperatly needing opportunities not to mention all of us spending our american earned dollars on their services!"
1,"Ice storm in Massachusetts and Southern NH killed power for over half a million folks for up to 6 days. Naturally, Comcast service was disrupted as well. Understandable. What I do not understand is why Comcast would prevent their customers from viewing programs previously recorded on Comcast DVR equipment!I paid for the service and the rental of the equipment. The digital media is available on the hard drive but without a connection to Comcast, I am prevented from watching it. Is this right (legal, ethical)? I paid Comcast for the programs and the hardware on which it was recorded. I am not reproducing it, I only wish to watch what I paid for. How can Comcast prevent me from viewing this content simply because their service is down? "
1,"Went to the Cherry Hill/Voorhees drop off center and they said they don't have the new boxes and won't have them till January.  Called back to find out that we never got the cables.  Went back and got the cables. 
Called on the phone and ordered the correct box.  Waited by mail, 7 days.
Box that arrived is not even an HD.Called service, no idea why it happened and has NO SOLUTION other than to wait.  Using inferior cables on the new HD tv and waiting for boxes that may or may not ever arrive.WARRNING: If you live in CAMDEN BURLINGTON or GLOUCESTER Counties and upgrade to HD boxes from Comcast, you will not get the newest version. What you will get is the opportunity to wait for the box that fits your HD and pay for the real box. Also you will have the pleasure of waiting and not get a customer service rep who knows the difference between a HD and a regular box.

1,"The cable company disconnected the internet service as of September 1, 2008 and pick up their box. However there was no service contract, the company is billing $60.67 for services from 11/15/2008 to 12/14/2008.Every time I tried to reach them took long long time on hold and the operator keep transfering from one to another place. Some irresponsible person come on the line and keep saying they will look into the account and send another bill. It never gets fixed. Now I am getting collection notices for $60.67."
1,"I called comcast cable for service and they sent someone out on saturday 13,2008 between 1&3 pm. no problem. the service man shows-up without a pre-call from the company which I was told I would receive.He had no tools no work order and after switching some wires and adding wires which I supplied he informs me that my television is broken .He never called anyone. He said that a supervisor(who's name is Joe) will come out because I refused to except his explaination.This is a brand new television and the third time that I have called for service and was told my television was broken only to have to wait for someone else to come out( a much longer wait time I must add)to say oh! the last service rep did something wrong.I usually get a follow-up call and it's been three days and still no call,no supervisor,and the wires that the service rep switched around have not been corrected.Also at that time I was offered a 3 (mon.)trial service where they would come and fix anything connected to the cable for free then after the 3 (mon.) it would be $5.95 pre mon.On October 22,2008 Comcast Cable came out to connect my tv,dvd,and,vhs and to repair a loose wire. If at this time my equipment is broken they did it."
1,"I have continuously received collection notice from Credit Protection Association L.P., asking me to send $56.74 to them for the money I have paid Comcast three (3) months ago.  This is a closed account. I had initially paid the amount on Comcasts web site with my credit card when I got bill. But Comcast closed the account without charging to my credit card. I was sent another bill and followed by the collection notice right after. I paid that bill immediately over phone with my credit card. Since then, I have received four collection notices and I called Comcast 4 times. Each time, the service person said that the account was clear and she would send an internal email for processing. But I have got nothing but the collection notice. This time the collection notice ask me to pay IMMEDIATELY or face credit damage! hours and hours phone calls trying to reach Comcast service. It's long and difficult. Also, don't know how to do if it stains my credit records."
1,Repeatedly I get collection calls on my cell phone for 2 seperate accounts. These 2 accounts have my cell number listed as their contact number !!! I DO not nor have I ever had service w/ Comcast. After 2 months of this I finally called the Comcast President's office who refused to help me unless I provided them with my personal info. I refused explaining that I am NOT a customer and if necessary they need to cancel the end user's cable service until he/she provides correct contact info !! Or if the they had any intelligence at all..they could call their billing department directly as my cell phone number is linked to the accounts !! This is harrassment & COMCAST refuses to rectify the problem. 
1,"I purchased a Panasonic flat screen that uses a cable card instead of a Box. Time Warner was the cable provider at that time.  Shortly there after Comcast came into play.  Since that time there cards have failed on no fewer than 7 times.  Last night the cable service went out about midnight.  I called this morning and was put into the loop for 34 minutes prior to speaking to a real person.  She was very pleasant and valued my business and would be sure to have some one call me within 48 hours.  This is not acceptiable.  I spend a lot of money with these folks and have not been happy that they haven't been able to resolve the issue.Every time the schedule a call, I am without the cable service for 48 hours.  Then I have to wait here for them to come in their usual hour slot.  Never show up in the 1st 2nd or 3rd hr.  Then I have to wait for them to re invent the wheel tying me up for another 2 hours."
1,"To be honest I never look at my cable bill I pay 100.00 every couple weeks or so to keep it current because I don't care much for them. Comcast recently interrupted my service for  having an outstanding balance. When I called to inquire I was told I owed 285.79 which were all ADULT Pay-Per-View movies charges, 22 of them ordered over a five day period. After much protest I was told they will do an investigation into this. After 2 wks I was informed that the bulk of the movies were ordered from my childs box and many double ordered (the same movie ordered at the same time on another pay-per-view channel). The times they were ordered varied 8am, 2pm, 11am, 6pm, 7pm, 10pm, 11pm, and I never sleep before midnight and I'm up by 7am on weekends and 4:30am during the week yet Comcast insist that despite the fact that during my long history as a customer I have no history of ordering ADULT MOVIES. Comcast rationale, because it takes 5 STEPS to order a movie it could not be a mistake they even made an inference that I am an inattentive parent. They did however credit my acct for all the double ordered movies at the tune a mere $67.00. They refuse to do anything further except turn off my service at every chance possible while I attempt to resolve this obsurd situation. Has Comcast done this to anyone else? I think they may be supplementing there income during these econmically challenging times by doing this. I have filed a police report & I will file a complaint against Comcast in court. A friend is willing to file a class action lawsuit. I have had to pay 520.00 to restore my service as my new months bill was also added, all right before Christmas."
1,"I went on line to order Comcast Cable and High speed Internet for my new house. I was prompted to list the city where I live. The order was accepted. I called the next day to confirm. I was told Comcast does not provide service in my area. The modem arrived two days later. My credit card was charged $89.99 for a modem that I cannot use and a service that I cannot have. I have been trying to return this modem for over 2 months. Noone at Comcast or Broadband would help me get my money back. Tomorrow, I will take the modem that is still its box to the post office and pay for retuning it back to the address that came from. I am hoping that someone in Broadband office in Georgia will come to relize that they charged me for something I cannot utilize because Comcast failed to notify me that they do not provide service in my area. I would like someone to contact me with an advice how I should proceed in this matter.  I am still out the $89.99 that I paid for the modem. I need my money back!"
1,"I scheduled service to have an additional cable line installed into another room in my house.  The initial date of this service was 10/3/08.  No one showed and I was only notified an hour past the scheduled window that they were running late.  Being that I had other engagements and had already waited all afternoon, I was forced to reschedule this service.  My closest consolation was for a month later on 11/11/08.  Again, no one showed and I was called well after the window. The third appointment was set for 12/11/08.  I was told in advance that if they did not show up an hour into the windowed time, to call.  And, since they didn't show up after an hour (no surprise), I called. No one at Comcast could get a straight answer and no dispatcher could be reached as to the whereabouts of my installer.  I spent over half an hour on the phone during this call, much of which was spent on hold.  I was informed that the guy would be there in his remaining 30 minutes scheduled.  So, as you might expect the timeframe again expired and no one showed or called.  I called back, was put on hold for 12 minutes until finally someone called me on the other line from Comcast saying the guy was here.  Miraculously, he pulled up about 30 minutes past the window and finally installed the cable. ...after installing the cable box in my room, he informed that it takes 20 minutes for the box to automatically program in all the channels and that, after that time, all channels would come in.  They never did. I called Comcast again, was put on hold for 15-20 minutes (with one hangup by them in between) and was put on with some doofus that said they weren't receiving a signal from my box and couldn't help me presently.  So this required setting up yet another date on 12/15/08 to have a technician come out and look at the problem in person. So, it will be 4 scheduled appointments, 2 no-shows, 1 late arrival and hours of being put on hold just to get cable installed and working properly (hopefully) in my room.Numerous lost hours of work and pay to wait around for false appointments, long useless phone calls, added stress, frustration, and complete hatred of this company."
1,   I have had the cable for ever and all of A sudden they turned me off I never recieved A bill and at that time I was going through some medical problems and I really did not want to talk to anyone and I did try to call but I was put on hold and I never did get to talk to any one that has been going on for A year I do want my cable back on I was going through Breast cancer at the time and I thought that they would have called me but I never heard from them after I did call to talk to these people to get things stright but like I said I never heard from them 
1,"We bundled our internet, cable tv, and telephone to Comcast earlier this year.  Even though all of these work for the most part there are annoying gliches that are driving us nuts!  The telephone conversations cut off without warning all the time!  And the internet freezes up and loses connection ... all the time!  There was no explanation of what was going to be required to install Comcast phone. The had to drill holes in the wall, install new phone jacks, and run wires through my garage like a clothesline, to connect outside. I just don't feel like there's anyone to call to correct the disconnect issues - I think it's just their inefficient equipment."
1,"I had Comcast cable, internet, & telephone service at my residence.  It took them 5 on-site service attempts to get these services correct.  1) Brought wrong cable box, needed HD/DVR and didn't get the phone connection into the existing lines to work on all jacks, 2) Brought correct box, couldn't fix phone, lost phone service intermittently, 3) Still couldn't fix bad phoine service, would stop working for hours/days, 4) Bad cable signal due to bad cable, finally got all phone outlets working, 5) finally got good phone signal.  They had to twice to correct charges for installation & repair.  The on-line software GUI for checking voicemail, in/out calls, blocking calls, etc...never worked 100%.  Had three open software issues with their internet GUI.  After the three issues, still couldn't do some of the on-line GUI options, i.e. call blocking, forwarding, and had intermittent issues with voicemail.  After all of the issues, now that I moved and disconnected on August 15th 2008, they tried to say I didn't turn in the cable modem. Since I moved 850 miles away to a statew they do not service, they gave me the run around for four weeks that I owed them money for the modem, just because I couldn't find the triplicate copy of the receipt that I turned it in along with the two receivers.  Well, as soon as I found the receipt, they said, it was their mistake - never had to show it to them.  They said they found the modem finally by its serial number. Anyway, now I needed a refund of almost $139 for monthly fees I'd already paid ahead.  Well, still to this day Dec. 5th, even after seven phone calls to customer service, have not received any refund check.  They claimed on the first few calls it would take 4-6 weeks to get it, after 6 weeks, they said 6-8 weeks, after 8 weeks they said up to 12 weeks, on the 12 week day, they claimed to have cut a check and were mailing it.  That was 2 weeks ago - still no check!  Amazing incompetence level of Comcast!  I will never ever use them again.Had to come home from work three times during the day to work with service tech.  I am out almost $139 for past due overpayment."
1,"we have had our cable and internet with COMCAST back when they were Road Runner... forever!  this past summer I finally took the plunge and added the phone; this was a HUGE mistake!    someone from COMCAST called me with a DEAL that my bill would be $10.00 less by 'bundling' my phone.  well, I thought Id do it because i wanted to get the DVR and that was $12.95 per month for that box/service.  plus Id be saving the $48.00 from our monthly VERIZON home phone bill!  after it was all said and done, the guy mentioned that we would be receiving the STARS channel FREE for 2 months and i would need to call to cancel it.  i marked this date on my calendar and later when i called i was told that if i take STARS off, then i will LOSE HBO and a boat load of regular cable channels. i also found out that my HBO was NOW BUNDLED UP WITH THE STARS CHANNEL and instead of the $10.00 for that one premium channel, it's now called PERFERED WITH HBO [or something like that] and it's $28.45! AND if i take off my 'BAND NEW I NEVER WANTED PERFERED BUNDLE PACKAGE' i would be paying MORE money because they would NEED to charge me separately for ALL my BUNDLED UP services.   Im paying about $170 per month! so without the PREMIUM channels which is $28.45, one would think it would drop down to $140.00. NOT!  oh no i would be paying over $180.00!  regardless of what i tried to do, they would make it so YOU or I would be paying MORE than what you're current charges are EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE STILL BUNDLED with all three services   and then they have the audacity to tell me that Im saving money by keeping it the way it is! i called COMCAST a few days ago to have HBO and STARS [premium channels] removed.  even after i elevated this, they are ALL trained to screw, manipulate, defraud, rip off, cheat and monopolize hard working people. HOW COULD ANY COMPANY MAKE IT COST MORE FOR LESS SERVICE?  this is out right SLAMING, TRICKERY, and DISGRACEFUL!   Im LOOKING for a new home phone company AND a new internet provider.  there is NO other option for cable since it's too windy for us to get the dish... but let me tell you that Im going to UNBUNDLE my 3 services and then Ill HAVE my BASIC CABLE with my stinkin DVR box!  and last but not least, Im telling the world how NASTY and GREEDY COMCAST is and BAD NEWS travels far faster than there internet anyway!"
1,"I have been a cable user with Adelphia since 2002, the company that was taken over by Comcast.I called to ask to add an HD receiver and the rep told me that would cancel my entire contractual arrangement with Comcast for all services written with Adelphia which they had agreed to honor.Comcast would now up my rates (Currently over $100 per month for all cable TV services +  Internet service) and also change my current Internet contracted rate of $25.22 per month I obtained by buying all Adelphia television services.They were to honor those contracts I believe.A cable box is $6.95 per month, why not just provide that added charge? By adding anything to the service it gives them the excuse to force completely new pricing across the entire contract. It seems the company doesn't care about the customer - only to get as much as they can from the customer. I would by happy to pay for the HD box.They want to charge $49.95 vs. $25.22 for Internet because I want to ADD an HD box?I think these people are arrogant, need more competition and better management.   The consequences are I will review  other service options with a good chance I will change my business with Comcast.It takes one customer at a time to erode a business."
1,"I had Comcast bundled services and was discontinuing them.  I had paid for service thru Nov 14.  I arranged for QWest to change my phone on Nov 10.  Comcast cut off my phone on Nov 5 so I was without phone for 5 days.  I returned Comcast's equipment and terminated all service on Nov 12.  Comcast sent me a bill with a Previous Balnce of $215.85 and credits for $137.98.  That left an amount due of $77.87.  My previous bill from Comcast showed a balance of $130.58 which was paid by credit card on Oct 16th.  Comcast bill did not indicate where the new $218.85 balance came from.  I called Comcast and they said their billing was correct.  They said I had unbundled my services so I owed more money.  I did not unbundle my services, I was discontinuing my services and I was paid thru Nov 14. I am not going to pay them anymore money.I am concerned that their bill wll go to collection agency and eventually damage my credit."
1,"Excessive billing.   Was mis-led concerning charges.  Was told there would be no fees to emplement theirproduct!!!.  Have had nothing but extra fee's for more than three months. In what should have been a about a 180to maybe a 190.  they have come up with a 229.71.   All for one time charges.  They are always charging a one time fee for everything thet do!!!!In an attempt to conserve on spending, and through their adds,, I have spent more than double compared to what I was doing!!!...  For example;  I changed over to their phone service. Or they call it digital voice.  It was 24.95 quoted to me.  I asked about special charges,, theit response as always ,, theres no charge!!.   Out of a quote of 24.95, per month,  how do they come up with 64.31.Plus one time charges of 64.94.  I don't get it.   All I know I spending a far more than I anticipated, while trying to purchase a cheaper service."
1,"COMCAST changed the delivery of two channels, 27-Readers Digest, and 52- History channel, from ANALOG to DIGITAL on the cable delivery itself. This means hat these two channels are no longer available on analog TV sets. COMCAST advertizes claims that no changes are necessary in the forthcomming switch to digital BROADCASTING if you are already a cable subscriber. However, changing these two channels to digital means that I can no longer receive them on TV's that are not connected to extra cost equipment. A COMCAST representative told me that I would have to rent/lease an additional decoder at $ 5.95/month for EACH analog TV that I want to continue to receive these channels. This is essentially a reduction of service without a reduction in cost. Reduction of service or extyra cost for what was existing service, and false advertising"
1,"I have a major complaint with the tech's that were here to install a digital cable box.  I was told that today the tech would be here between 11:30 and 3.  The tech showed up at 6:05 pm.  He couldn't get the box to work then he went down to the basement to see were the line comes in at.  He discontected my amplifier that gives a little extra power (the Comcast put on last year) and said that shouldn't have been installed.  Then he goes upstairs and turns on my computer and messes around with it.  He disconnected my Vonage phone modem and said that was one of the problems. At this time my wife is extremely un-nerved since she is the only one home at this time.  He then calls another tech to the house and one is down the basement and the other is on my computer.  My wife ask him why are you on the computer and he points to the computer modem (with Comcast logo) and teels her it's a Comcast modem see and I am Comcast so that's the problem.  He tells my wife that he will be back tomorrow at 7 to 9 to fix the problem so will have to do without phone service until then.      It took both tech's, talking about family issues like double dating and meeting each others wifes, almost 2 hours to do nothing but take my phone service away.       My wife was exstremly upset and was physicaly shaking when I got home at 9 pm.  Our dinner was burned becasue my wife didn't know what to do by either leaving this strange man upstairs on our private computer or go down stairs and watch the other guy or get the dinner of the stove before it burned. The experience leaves an extremly bad taste in my mouth for Comcast.  For the first time in years of being a Comcast customer I am calling around for a dish provider to see if I can get t.v., internet and phone service."
1,"I switched from Comcast to Verizon.  The Comcast technician entered our cond's utility room, removed MY cable from the Verizon distribution box and cut the connector off.  When we got home we havd no TV.  I called Comcast and the representatives claimed over and over that the cable beloned to Camcast and they could cut it off.  The cable was installed by the cond's builder and is therefore the property of the unit owners.  The representative would not even listen to my explination of the building instillation.  They said I was no longer a Comcast customer and I would have to call Verizon. Verizon was helpfull and come out the next day to repair the damage Comcast did.   The Verizon technicians could not understand how the Comcast technician could not have understood the differances in the two companied distribuition equiment.Verizon was forced to repair the Comcast damage, and we lost TV for 18 hours"
1,"the cable box went out and I reported it, in their repair visit they opted to change the boxes, they charged me forthe boxes without notice of the the increase and refuse to remove the charges. The company has been overbilling me for services and refuse to adjust the charges. I have requested a sipervisor call back and haven't receive one yet. I requested to speak with Ms. Rebecca in their executive offices and they refuse to refer the call or a call back. I have been paying the bill and have since turned in their boxes and I kept the basic cable with the internet service only as the bill would go up unless I did this per the representative in the office. I have gotten no result and have reported the overcharges to the FCC as well withinthe last week. I now have a disconnect notice again for $200.00 which I don't owe for December 2, 2008. I would appreciate this problem cleared, credit for the times without service and adjustments owed made.Please have someone from your agancy help me with this. I have found that comcast falsly advertises service and fails to deliver what they advertise, billing their customers at their whim.I was at time without service, without an adjustment give for that time. Due to the law of service changes to come in 2009, the consumer has the right to get their own equipment and not be forced to take this agencies if they want without cost, the company opted to change their boxes to digital and charged the customers without notice of any type until the billing then refuse to adjust the charges."
1,"Channel 65 did not work since about August 1, 2008 on all non-cable box TVs
Low or no signals since September 15, 2008.
Technicians at house about once a week since October 1, 2008.
Specific Dates

1,"I purchased NHL Center Ice at the beginning of the hockey season so that I could watch the SJ Sharks games that are not broadcast on the Comcast Bay Area Sportnet (I believe there are 12 games). I wasn't informed by the comcast rep that the SF Bay Area didn't have the bandwidth to carry all 20 channels, instead they carry 10 channels. As a result, on 11/29/08 a Sharks v. Coyotes game that was broadcast on channel 558 I couldn't see cause our area didn't get that channel. I paid for the full package yet I am not getting what the commercials advertised. Comcast should have notified me before I purchased the package, or given me a discounted price."
1,"My response was, that I am not paying another increase to Comcast and that  I refuse to personally bail out another company, due to poor management.  It is sickening what they get away with.  Someone needs to take these issues with Comcast, to Congress"
1,"for my october billing i was charged 2 differnt amounts on each, the online billing and the paper billing, the paper billing being almost $13 less. of course i paid teh paper billing and then i was threatened with being charged a late fee in the next billing with the statement that i did not pay my bill in full, though i did use the remittance stub. and all of a sudden the fee is higher over all. i called comcats but could not get an explanation, i emailed comcast but could not ger a satisfeying response. sandi who calims to be in the executive office of customer care called but i am unable to call her back because i work during the day. finally she emaild me stating she will not answer my simple questions (as to why the difference in the amounts) vial email, which is what i requested so i have a record of it, citing account security. this is a gernal question and with my request she should answer the simpe question."
1,when I subscribe to cable latino optimo with comcast cable they toldme I will be able to watch chanels fom 1 to 99  now I'm paying $6.00 dolars more per month and getting less chanels .I call the company and complaint about it they toldme I was getting all those chanels by accident because they weren't able to bolck them .they should give the costumers the right information before they get the service .I feel this is scam.
1,"I just opened a new account with Comcast for cable & internet. I have paid as agreed. This complaint concerns an online payment made on 11-8-08 for $74.07.  Comcast notified me by postcard on 11-16-08 that the payment was Reversed and that a $25.00 Reversal Fee was charged to my account.  I contacted my bank, VyStar. A representative stated that Comcast had never made a request for the $74.07! Even if the bank was mistaken, I have an automatic overdraft and the debit would have been covered.  Comcast never processed my EFT! Then they charged me $25.00 falsely, stating that the fee had been reversed by my bank.  This is an outright untruth!  I wrote a letter to Credit & Collections with the information from my bank, and requested that the $25 fee be removed.  I copied this letter in an email to Reg Griffin, vice president, communications, southern division. I requested a Read receipt. Mr. G read my email the same day it was sent.   As of this date, I have received no response from him.  The EFT payment has still not been processed by Comcast. Comcast's post card to me states that I owe $178.14, which equals two monthly payments plus the $25.00 fee.Unjust $25.00 Reversal fee; unsure of the additional monthly payment; unsure of the status of the discounts for opening my account, as they may be removed because of the supposed Reversal."
1,"I am having all kind of problem with my comcast service at business. I am dealing with Schaumburg, IL call center. Don't know what they are doing. Specially, I will give some names--Jeniffer, Ed, Rob and also their supervisors name David and Chris. They do not have any answer of your questions on same phone call.Lost more than $3000.00 in credit card business for the weekend."
1,"   In January 2006, a service technician came to my home and wrongly communicated to his office that I had HD/DVR converter box that I didnt have.  I was unaware of this and continued to pay the monthly bill without fully reviewing the details because I had no reason to question the monthly bill.  In July 2008 another service technician came to switch out a converter box that no longer worked and at that time he informed me that I was being charged for an upgraded box that I didn't have!  Yes, thats right I was being charged for the HD/DVR converter box.  I immediately contacted Comcast to get the matter straightened out and was told that I would receive a credit for 6 months on the HD/DVR box.  The representative at that time went on to explain that because so much time had transpired (2006 to 2008) Comcast couldn't go back and make an adjustment to the original date of the upgrade, but instead would offer me the converter box free for one year.  I reluctantly agreed and continued to pay the bill.  I just looked at the bill for November and realized that Comcast has continued to bill me for the converter box all along.  I feel that this situation should be investigated because I've been paying for a product/service that was not provided and the promise to make good on the overcharge was never honored.  I have called Comcast three times in the past week and given the run around.  Now as I write this, I'm trying to get this situation resolved, but I don't feel confident that Comcast can be trusted to correct this wrong on their own.  A week ago I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told none were available - the representative took my daytime number and promised that I would receive a call the next day.  I'm still waiting.  Every time I call about this situation, I'm forced to start from the beginning which leads me to believe there is a great deal of inefficiency regarding Comcast's ability to correct it's own errors.  In the meantime, the rates have gone up and they continue to charge me for a box that was not in my possession for almost two years!  I hope that you will find this important enough to investigate as I find it hard to believe that I'm the only one to have this particular problem with Comcast.  
As I mentioned, Im writing this as I attempt to get this situation resolved and the representative I was speaking with (Rebecca) insisted that I didnt know what I was talking about and then responded by hanging up in my face!  I would really ask that you look into this matter.Thank you and I anticipate your response.I immediately contacted Comcast to get the matter straightened out and was told that I would receive a credit for 6 months on the HD/DVR box.

1,"I had a schedule appointment for Saturaday November 22, 2008 between the hours of 2-5 pm.  I called at 3:30 pm to check on the cable guy they told me that he is still on his way.  I called again at 4:30 pm to check on the cable guy again and they told me that he had been to my house and knocked on my door and he said he even called.  He LIED.  He went to the wrong [address].  I was very upset that he lied and said that he called and he did not and said that he came to my door.  I had been home since 1:30pm and no one showed up. Comcast has the worst people to come out to your house to do anything for your cable. Now I had to schedule another appointment for this Wednesday from November 26 2008 8-11am to come out again. I have to take off from work to get this done."
1,"My family and I have noticed a huge difference in connection on the Comcast internet service. Pages load very slowly and ,the new Smart Zone E-mail service is a joke. It's funny we had no problems until they introduced the Smart Zone service that was upgraded from their previous version. We pay a lot for internet service as well as our Cable service. At this point, considering the absolute hassle of waiting, waiting on the telephone to talk to a real person, I think I'll tell them what they can do with their over-priced and under-achieveing service. What a rip!"
1,"For the last few weeks, everytime the Comcast ad comes on my Yahoo mail page, I'm kicked off line. It's like they have control of my account, which is with Bell South & just want me to look up & see their ad. As if, I'd change back to them. Such aggravation, but I don't know who to complain to. It's not Yahoo's fault, or Bell South & I don't have a Comcast account. I can't find any way to contact Yahoo to tell them & see if they can quit selling ad space to Comcast. I'm trying to do my little selling business on ebay & this is a big distraction when I'm in a hurry. Even reading my mail can be a problem with the internet going down over & over. Is this a common complaint? Could someone let me know?"
1,"On hold for 1.5 hours, no answer.  "
1,"They ran a promotional offer of a free 19 inch TV when signing up for their triple play program. I asked before I signed up, and they said, yes I would get the T.V.  They never sent it. This took place at the beginning of June 2008.  I addressed the issue on 5 separate occassions 5 Representatives. 4 apologizied, agreed that I was entitled to the T.V & promised to find out what happened. The last Rep., Shaun said I wasn't entitled to it. He tried to change the terms of the contract, making it more expensive for me. I refused to agree. Comcast sent me a new contract in the mail after I had already returned their original contract in June 2008.My children at home were not able to have an additional set to watch. They fought over watching programs and argued all the time."
1,"I am writing this letter to seek help from you concerning a contract i have with comcast cable. I was offered a package deal from comcast for 2 years @159.99 a month (cost me more than 215 dollars a month after getting all the cable boxes) but part of the package was a dads and grads program that offered a 19 inch hdtv. after signing the contract they sent me a letter that explained the offer and what web site to go to for the offer, i filled out the information on the web site and thought i was all set, but i never received my tv, so i called comcast numerous times at which time they told me they would file complaints and get it all straightened out, still no calls, no tv. Finally i emailed the customer service VP and      thats when they called me and told me i didnt qualify for that offer and tried to offer me 100 dollars which i refused and ask to speak to a supervisor, who called me back and offered 200 dollars or change the contract to one year at bundle price and one year at full price, then they would give me the tv, but thats not what we orginally agreed upon; after i have allready payed them more then 1200 dollars. I just feel like i've been scammed and i just want what they promised.                                      thankyou,"
1,"Comcast has moved four channels from my service to digital only requiring me to purchase or rent a converter in order to receive them.  Comcast should either reduce its fee for my service OR add four replacement channels - such as Fox Business Network for  those of us who do not have to deal with multiple boxes next to TV sets and multiple remotes to access channels.  I am a long standing customer of Comcast but I am seriously considering switching to satellite, and I know others that feel strongly about this who may not send a complaint before leaving Comcast."
1,"A year later, after being totally frustrated I contacted Comcast Cable Service again and told them I wanted a refund for the year of cable that I paid for and never received.  They told me they were only going to refund me for two weeks.  I am completely frustrated with Comcast because they do not have quality service providers that install the product and fix the product nor do they have professional customer service representatives that know how to handle the situation.  I want a refund and a service provider that KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO INSTALL MY CABLE BOX CORRECTLY.  IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR."
1,"I am still waiting on a refund check, and customer service will not tell me the status of the refund.  I had cable service in Houston Tx,  until we moved out of state, and I requested service disconnected and account to be closed.  All equipment was returned and I closed account on Aug. 14th.   After numerous phone calls to customer service and billing service,  I have requested to speak to accounting SUPERVISOR , but they won't put me through to a supervisor.  Still, at the end of our conversation,  which never yields any concrete information,  I again request to speak to a supervisor,  and am always told by the representative I am speaking with, that they supervisor is not available, but they will have the supervisor call me back.  From the beginning of my inquiries, I have been told several different time frames on when my refund check will be issued (1st time they said  4-6wks from when acct. was closed.   then,  6-8 wks,  then 8-10 wks,   then up to 12 weeks   On 10/15, I finally found out that they had my refund on hold, due to incorrect information that equipment was not returned. ALL equipment was in fact returned on Aug. 14th, in Houston TX.   They assured me that would be corrected and entered into the system, and as soon as that happened,   then the Accounting dept. would be able to  process my refund, and it should be 4-6 weeks for the check to be issued.     Every time since then, when I call to check and see if the check has been issued, I ask to speak with the accounting supervisor so I don't have to go through the WHOLE story again.   They NEVER put me through to the supervisor. I have been told something new and/or different every time I speak with a customer service representative.    I am not sure if the actual problem that was holding up my refund was ever truly resolved and corrected, and when I called on 11/17,  to check on the status ,  the representative had NO clue and just wanted to keep going back to the very beginning of my saga.  Customer service is very defensive and not willing to put me through to a supervisor.   I am not sure if they actually ever really even submit my request to speak to a supervisor, because after 3 specific times,  I have yet to get a call back.  Still waiting for my refund check for $52.60"
1,"As always I tried to contact Comcast for interrupted cable TV service and excessive monthly charges, instead they offered to fix the issue and upgrade my program.After the call, I could not access ANY of the offered premium channels. A technician was scheduled but not before having three troubleshooting calls with different Support Reps.Long story short, the technician arrived as scheduled and left me just the local channels (no premium or digital access at all). No surprise I'm getting only 24 channels and paying $45 a month for unlimited premium access.When asked to speak with supervisors I get the same line: All our supervisors are currently servicing other customer but will be calling you in one hour. It's been 72 hours and still no call.After 10 calls and 5 hours on the line, I was transferred to a Supervisor under the name of Marie (they never provide an employee # or last names) who just gave me the 1800 number for complaints (1-800-762-3189).I'm currently fighting to avoid this to happen to anyone in the future by going in to every blog and website I find in the Internet about Comcast."
1,"THey have consistently not provided the Howard Stern Service in its entirety. But charge the full price. This has gone on for years.. This is the problem with Monopolies.. Without competition there is apathy. When one is the only show in town, who cares... Certainly not the cable company.One can go on howardtv.com and see what is supposed to be playing. I actually took pictures months ago of what I should have been getting and what I was actually getting. I wrote the VP and was ignored. Finally DUANE called me and confessed their local equipment could not handle the whole amount of ONDEMAND offered. And that it would be upgraded in JULY. THis after years of ******** to TWC and COMCAST Who bought them out. THey knowingly perpetrated a fraud and they stole. I paid the full amount each month for services that were not provided. Today I finally canceled The howard Stern channel after multiple calls and the problems were not rectified. "
1,"I have complained that I do not get a bill until it is one month late then Comcast adds fees.  This has been going on for the last year. I believe it is a scam to skip a mailing and then bill for late fees.  There option is for me to chase down my bills online, as if I have time for that, and make payment.  I asked for them to remove the late fees because it is their fault and they will not.Extra charges to me! The Credit card companies were in trouble for mailing bills late so as to collect fees now Comcast is just skipping a month then billing for late fees."
1,"Comcast interrupts the CNN broadcast shows from 8 pm on, to air their public service announcements. It is very irritating, and unfair, being that I pay to watch these broadcast shows. I miss the last 5 minutes of every show from 8-10p.m. that airs on CNN. They claim that they have permission from CNN to do this, but I can't see why CNN would give their time away. Satelite subscribers don't have to put up with that.Consequences are out of my pocket, and possibly out of CNN's pocket as well. Ifeel i have a legitimate complaint here. I pay for the priveledge to watch CNN in it's entirety, regardless what show it is. To watch a show and miss the last 5 minutes is very annoying."
1,"I bundled my services under the 'triple-play' deal from Comcast. Cable tv, Internet, and phone, all for 99.99. When I first switched, I was overcharged 10 dollars a month, so I called and was told that whoever set up my account did so incorrectly and the only way to fix it was to add a recurring 10 dollar rebate to my account. What struck me as funny is that the 10 dollar rebate showed up in the 'one time fees' are of my bill. So I have a recurring one-time fee each month now. When I signed up for automatic billing my bill jumped again. I called and was told that someone had made an error and my bill was corrected. When I signed up for paperless billing my bill jumped again. I called and got the same answer, someone had made a mistake and it was corrected. A few months back I noticed my bill had jumped again and called, they fixed the problem as usual but I'd had enough so I canceled. Then I was charged 50$. I called and was told someone had made a mistake and it will be taken care of. While I was diligent enough to prevent any damages I find it almost impossible that simply as a coincidence each time I did something that made it less likely that I would scrutinize my bill (auto pay, e-bill) I was overcharged."
1,"   I must say that Comcast is one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with. We recently moved in a townhome and signed up for their cable, digital phone and high speed Internet service. First of all, we noticed  between upstairs and downstairs, we were getting different channels on the cable. Most of the channels we were getting downstairs werent available upstairs, so my boyfriend went to a local office and got a new set top box. When that didnt resolve the issue, he went back and got yet another box. Well, that didnt help the issue either, and they sent a technician to our place. When the guy was troubleshooting the issue, he called the office and asked some lady to reboot the box from their office, but for some reasons, she refused to do it for him, and they started arguing over the phone! After 30-40 minutes of them going back and forth, he finally decided to swap boxes , but we told him that we already had like 3 different boxes and that didnt help, and we ended up returning the box and settling with basic service.In the meanwhile, we also noticed our Internet connection was going off almost every hour. First, I thought our router went bad, so I bypassed it and directly connected my laptop to the modem and see what happened. The connection still kept going off, so I called Comcast and they sent a technician. Although I explained that I already tested without the router, the guy told me to go buy a router. I didnt really feel like dealing with him, so I just said okay and sent him home. The problem persisted (of course), so I called them again, and another tech came by. This time, he borrowed my laptop to test the connection, but after a minute or so of doing something? on my computer, he turned around, showed me my laptop screen and said, Here. This is Google.? I was like what the heck is this guy talking about?? I never said that the connection was down when he arrived, and for him to make it look like there was no problem only because he happened? to be able to access Google is absurd. I gently told him that I knew what Google was and I reminded him that the problem was intermittent. He troubleshot for another few minutes, but then he said whatever the device he needed to check the modem was broke, and he left without calling another technician in or scheduling another appointment.Then, the third tech came by, and it was dj vu all over again. He first blamed my router, and I told him that wasnt the case. Then he said maybe my cable was loose or bad. Hello! Whats the odd of that happening to two laptops/cables at the same time?? Then, he said some stupid thing like it was weird for me to lose the connection while Windows indicated the connection was good. Well, I never said that, and I dont know where he got that idea from. Finally he said that if online? light on the modem is on, that means everything is good, and theres nothing he can do. 
Indeed, the online light never goes off, but just as Im typing this message, my connection is down, and this is completely utterly unacceptable.
After going through all the nonsense, I just learned today that our next Comcast bill is going to be over 300 bucks because they charged for these guys to come by and look at the problem, and because they determined? the problem was mine not theirs, I have to pay for their service. Also, there was a 911 call charge on our bill when we never dialed 911!!! What is going on??I called AT&T to see if I could switch the provider, but AT&T currently doesnt serve my area, and Im basically stuck with Comcast. This, I call monopoly.I noticed Comcast started offering home security service, and I wonder what kind of people would rely on Comcast for home protection??? I cant wait to get out of this place and move somewhere AT&T service is available. I never thought I would move to another area because of ISP!Well, that didnt help the issue either, and they sent a technician to our place. When the guy was troubleshooting the issue, he called the office and asked some lady to reboot the box from their office, but for some reasons, she refused to do it for him, and they started arguing over the phone! After 30-40 minutes of them going back and forth, he finally decided to swap boxes , but we told him that we already had like 3 different boxes and that didnt help, and we ended up returning the box and settling with basic service.In the meanwhile, we also noticed our Internet connection was going off almost every hour. First, I thought our router went bad, so I bypassed it and directly connected my laptop to the modem and see what happened. The connection still kept going off, so I called Comcast and they sent a technician. Although I explained that I already tested without the router, the guy told me to go buy a router. I didnt really feel like dealing with him, so I just said okay and sent him home. The problem persisted (of course), so I called them again, and another tech came by. This time, he borrowed my laptop to test the connection, but after a minute or so of doing something? on my computer, he turned around, showed me my laptop screen and said, Here. This is Google.? I was like what the heck is this guy talking about?? I never said that the connection was down when he arrived, and for him to make it look like there was no problem only because he happened? to be able to access Google is absurd. I gently told him that I knew what Google was and I reminded him that the problem was intermittent. He troubleshot for another few minutes, but then he said whatever the device he needed to check the modem was broke, and he left without calling another technician in or scheduling another appointment.Then, the third tech came by, and it was dj vu all over again. He first blamed my router, and I told him that wasnt the case. Then he said maybe my cable was loose or bad. Hello! Whats the odd of that happening to two laptops/cables at the same time??

1,For last 6 months due to there changes to digital we have lost few channels and the quality of the picture has gone down they want do nothing about it and keep putting the rates up ever year and they make you sign a 5 to 10 years contract nobody informs you of anything. they tell me that they dont have to tell anybody. can't wait till the contract is up
1,"I live on a budget, disabled and cant work. I cant afford to be paying 160.00 just to watch tv. this time I dont have a name of who I talked to, but she was saying  well at this time we have no promo to give to you I was paying 113.00 and now it jumps again to 160.00 Last year I was only paying 70 something.. and I had to keep calling every 4-6 months to get a deal. Its not right that they have such power over TV. I changed one time to just very basic, I got 3 channels that I watched regularly. I use 3 of there services, phone, cable, and internet. Why and how can they get away with such high prices? "
1,"Comcast is one of the largest cable/phone/internet providers in my area. They are also one of the biggest scammers that I know of. I can't believe that they try some of the most ridiculous tactics to try to get more money out of your pocket. I pay my bill on time, as soon as I receive it in the mail and still continue to. But every time I receive a new bill, it keeps saying that I am accessed a late charge from the previous month. And every time, I have to call up their customer service and try to correct the problem. Then they give me some whatever answer and fix the problem, but it's only for that month.And to no surprise, yes, it happens again the next month. I think having to call up numerous times in a couple of months is just too much. Do they not understand that maybe something is wrong with their system? They seem to try to charge you for things that they think you wouldn't notice like movies or calls you didn't even watch or make. Or it seems, they will try to charge you for something and see if you'll call them up to fix it. And if you don't call, they got you. They may only get you for a couple of bucks or just some change. But, if you multiply that by how ever many customers they have. Then you've accrued yourself a pretty good amount of change.Unfortunately, I have no choice but to stay with Comcast because of the contract that I'm in with them. But, something has to be done. I don't know of anyone in my city that is satisfied with Comcast. Our local news station even did a segment about Comcast and how terrible they are. Many people want them out. This cannot continue. They charge us so much money for what little or poor service that they give us. It takes forever for us customers to reach someone to help us when we call. And most of the time, they give us someone that is either unqualified or outright rude to speak with. They even get upset with you when you ask to speak with a supervisor or manager. And then, even the supervisor or manager will get pretty sassy with you. I think Comcast needs to start all over with their business from the ground up. They need to also retake a couple of courses in Business Ethics. It's definitely not a company that many people want to deal with. It's not one that I want to deal with either. But, I have no choice.

1,"We are extremely displeased with the lack of communication and customer service from Comcast.  We began service on August 20, 2008 and have had nothing but difficulty from day one.  My husband travels a lot and erroneously made the first month's payment from an incorrect account; we were NEVER informed by Comcast that the payment had been reversed by the bank only to have the service interrupted.  We IMMEDIATELY made a payment to correct OUR error only to have NO service for TWO days (the first time) and no one willing to follow through to see what the 'technical' issue was.  Finally when a tech came out he got us up and running (taking the time out to FIX all that was NEVER done at the initial inside setup/connection) Less than a few days thereafter there was yet ANOTHER interruption in the service (the 2nd time).  The same tech came out and investigated the external connection only to find that there was an outside problem with the signal coming into our home.  He immediately contacted a field tech who came out immediately and repaired the bent cabling that was preventing us from getting a proper/strong signal. We had 'service' for about another week then the same issue of the phone line going dead when we were in the middle of a call as well as no internet service the cable box not receiveing signal.  We have been HUNG up on; calls mysteriously DISCONNECTED; promised CALL BACKS and CREDITS...all to NO AVAIL.  We have resided here in Georgia for 5 years and unfortunately as much as we have wanted Comcast service we were never in an area covered by Comcast.  When we finally moved into a Comcast serviceable area, we were so excited!  That excitement however, has been overshadowed and we have been THOROUGHLY disappointed by the less than exemplary 'service' we have received.We've emailed Rick Senior VP, who passed the buck onto Ms. U, I've spoken to a supervisor Linda as well as SEVERAL customer service representatives. No one is communicating with us nor is anyone notating the account when they tell us that they will credit us for the services until the issue is resolved.  We're tired of the communication breakdown, the blatant disregard and the broken promises.Our children utilize the internet for homework everyday as they are in an acclerated program. Everytime Comcast provides [bad] service, they are unable to complete their assignments in a timely manner.  They have promised to credit our account until they completely resolve the problem THEY HAVE NOT!"
1,Comcast has failed to deliver - It is 8:15 pm on a Saturday night - They were to be here between 4-6 - the appointment was to rectify the screw up that had occured in 3 previous visits - the first technician that visited tonight had apparently been drinking and left - the 2nd technician who arrived hours after the promised time is trying but clearly is limited I have spent over 24 hours of my time trying to get this resolved- have taken 3 days off work
1,"I have had problems with low signal since we moved into our house over 3 years ago. We've had over 10 service calls, most coming within the last 3 months. The techs have come out and given the same reason over and over. My house is about 140 feet away from the road, so they say that is due to the low signal. Spent hours out of work and actually wasted 5 hours 1 day to get my phone service repaired. I own a small business and this is time taken away from that.Finally on 11/6/08 a lead tech came out and within 15 minutes found out the poor signal was due to bad crimps in my line that were leaking signal. He repaired the crimps and the signal went from a minus 2 to a plus 8. Problem fixed in 15 MINUTES! Said he was truly embarassed that they hadn't found this out before. I contacted customer service to be oput on hold for 20 minutes. Said I needed to speak to a supervisor, but was told it would be a couple of days before they could call me back.Hundreds of dollars lost in revenue to my company due to the hours wasted waiting for techs to show up or on hold waiting to speak to someone at their company."
1,"I have had comcast for about 7 years now while i have lived in California. I have just taken a position in Massachusetts and i had my wife to phone to cancel the service because we do not have an address to go to just yet, but also asked what happens to our account. My wife was put onto the service dept and told that it would be available for up to 30 days after cancellation before it was actually turned off. That was fine as it gave us 30 days to either go back to comcast once we have found a place to live or find someone else in the area if comcast was not available. i was asked to bring back the modem of which i did yesterdy in San Jose, only to be told it terminated as soon as i brought back my modem. I find this inconvienient and not of you integity, as i had been told by 3 persons the opposite of what you actually did to me. i have been with you for 7 years and am a man that tries my best to live by the truth, not lies and to be  told on what you call recorded for custoner training or whaever you call it and actually be lied to is far from fair when most of my interaction with customers and clients and also my family are through this email address is not what you live by and that is INTEGRITY."
1,"We've had comcast for 3 years.  The first year we had minimal problems. Then we moved and all hell broke loose. From that point on, it's been a cable nightmare. Had I known it would be such an ongoing problem, I would've kept exact record of dates, times, names.  But I didn't do this, I can only say that for 2 years, on an almost monthly basis, I am on the phone dealing with these idiots. They simply do not care. They have done everything from try to charge me for things/services we do not have, to leaving me on hold multiple times, to being blatantly rude telling my husband to wrap the phone call up, to telling us they would fix the problem only to find our next bill is even worse, on and on and on.  We pay every month, on time. We pay for a service that we don't always get. Our cable goes out, our internet goes out, and if they have to send a tech, they want to charge us for THEIR problem! the list goes on and on...we are calling to cancel their service tomorrow, it's just not worth it anymore. They are too big a company, they just don't care about their customers or the quality of people they hire to represent their company. It's been a nightmare. I've wasted hours and hours dealing with 9 times out of 10, rude morons. And for what? Economic damage that's been incurred is that we are being illegally charged for service calls, and services that we do not have! Then we call to correct it and they say it will be corrected.  Then the next month, we owe MORE and it hasn't been corrected! It's driving me nuts, I'd rather get a root canal than to have to deal with Comcast anymore!"
1,I started my comcast service in august and was promissed a rebate and until today havent receiced anything from comcast. I sent all the appropriate forms before the deadline and havent received my 250 dollarsI was counting on that money to pay for the first months of the comcast services
1,"Appox 2 mths. ago my mother who is 84 yrs. requested that I get her a better cable pkg.  I called and changed the package for her.  She was delighted with the package until today (11/4/08). She informed me that her cable box broke and the new box they replaced it with did not get the channels she had before.  My Mother called Comcast to tell them she was not getting channels she had before and she was told the the other stations she had before she was not supposed to get in her package.  Being 84 and ill today I told her I would call to correct the problem.  When I called I was connected with a woman called Alex.  We spoke for a while regarding my mother's problem and the packages she has. I asked Alex to  identify certain channels that were or were not included. I informed her that I didn't think what she had was correct.  She was confused on what to do next but when I pressed on she told me that she was not allowed to make changes to my mother's account without her written authorization.  Four times during the conversation I requested to speak with a supervisor.  Finally on my fourth request I was put on hold and Tony Garcia, supervisor spoke with me.  Again I explained the situation, told him again the entire situation and that 2 mos. ago I had called and upgraded my mother's cable, the box broke etc. etc.  Now Tony tells meme that he is unable to even discuss my mother's account with me.  He offered to send an authorization form to me.  I asked him to please check the record so he could see that I called.  He did and said that the account was changed 2 mos agog but the holder made the changes.  Untrue -- it was me and they knew it at the time because I never called without identifying myself as the account holders daughter.   So today my mother sits at home ill without her stations and I sit here at work unable to help her.  I asked Tony if I could speak with a Manager but was told that Manager's do not take calls. Another problem I have with Comcast is that their Customer Service people do not have all the information regarding a service.  The people I spoke with today were unable to locate or tell me simple things like the numerals for station USA or exactly what stations were included in the packages.  There is no economic damage at this time as my mother has not paid out as much as what the stations she was getting are now worth according to Comcast.  I think what is wrong here is that we are quoted a price to sell and then once we have the service they change the pricing or eliminate the channels from the package moving them to a high priced one.  We like what we have so if we can afford it we pay the extra if not we have to do without.  Unfair I think. I would like Comcast to quote as well as post exactly what is included in each of their packages (specific channels).  If the package changes they should give notice as to when and what the new pricing is both online where we shop as well as mailing the changes.  Also quotes should be sent in writing confirming what each conversation is -- this can be emailed or regular mail. I am very upset right now and I am unable to help my mother who is home ill without the channels she thought she purchased and paid for."
1,"I have not had concistent cable service for over a month - long before Hurricane Ike. I have made MANY calls, explaining my story over and over, hace MANY techs come to look at the problem, and NOTHING has been solved. Every person I speak with says something completely different and nothing gets resolved. They are an incredibly inept organization. And did I mention the NUMEROUS supervisors I have asked to speak with that are never available and NEVER return my messages!I have missed work to meet their unreasonable and unrelaible appointment scheduling, have had no-shows, and absolute frustration!"
1,"On Oct 22 rec a disconnection notice for a missed Sep payment. The pymt was sent on 9-22 and was processed by comact on 9-30 the pymt was paid on from my mother's account like is has been for over 5yrs now. On Oct 22,24 and 27 I had to fax over the front and back of the check to Danica, Kimberly, and Freda. The check was cashed by not applied to the acct because my mom put a partial acct number on the check, but it was mailed with Comcast stub with the entire acct number on it. My cable was shut off on Thurs Oct 30 and today is the 31st my cable is still off, I have recieved nothing but rude service from Barbra and Sam. I'm paying for a service that I am not receiving, and no one is trying to rectify the situation"
1,"Cable has been having distorted picture off and for 2 months.  Not working about 50% of the time.  Comacast has sent 3 service techs that could not fix it.  No showed for their last appointment and now I can't be home for another appointment until November 7th.  They have offered a month of free cable but it hardly covers the expense or all of the missed work and lesiure that I have invested in waiting for service.  Now, their email service is down with no projected date for service to be restored. I use my email for business purposes (mostly for booking travel and receiving invoices and receipts as my job requires nearly constant travel).So I now need to set up new email accounts with another provider and notify all airlines, rental car companies, hotels, credit cards etc of the change of email.  Comcast will not give credit for the service interuption, saying that I pay for internet access, not email  Service has been sometimes sympathetic but more often than not rude, apathetic and borderline hostile. Paying now for 3 months of service that doesn't work as promised.  Lost work waiting for service or spending hours on the phone with comcast and with all my travel service providers and credit cards"
1,"I also have Comcast cable. In the last year, my signal quality has deteriorated significantly. I get out-of-sync, and dropouts. Many service visits have failed to fix the problems. Comcast service techs admit that the problem is with TV, internet and phone on the same cable, Comcast is delivering lower a lower quality signal.Also, Comcast has dropped at least 2 stations from their analog list and moved them the the digital list. I will not benefit from the digital conversion!I am paying more for less from Comcast and in Feb. 2009, I will be FORCED to pay for bad reception and reduced listings."
1,"we signed up for comcast about a year ago. from the onset we had problems. the fella who came to our house to install cable/internet did not write my name or driver's license number down correctly. i have just resolved this issue with comcast this month. it took about 10 months and numerous phone calls to resolve the name on the account issue.  i called 9 months ago to ask that the voice mail service be removed from our package. we don't use it, don't want, and should not be charged for it. i am still be charged for it, and it is not disabled (though i was told this afternoon that it would be disabled-- we'll check in 72 hours). this amounts to about $30 total, but still-- we have asked that it be removed from our bundle of services, and in these tough economic times, 30 bucks is nothing to sniff at (that's half a tank of gas!).   we got a call 3 weeks ago from a rep who said the promotional price of our bundle would expire. i called comcast and asked for a quote of the new price. a rep told me that the price was good for 3 more months. i called back the same day, a different rep told me that it expired in one month.   i called back again, was told the package would expire, but that they could extend the promo price for another 12 months, and that she would remove the voice mail option. (voice mail is still on. so i better check to make sure we are still getting the promo proce for another 12 months).   in short, comcast [is bad] and if we had another option for cable television (and not satellite) we would do it. such a monopoly. consequences are we have [bad] service with a company that has cornered the market on cable television and we have no other options. i have waisted time dealing with their reps who all give me a different response-- nobody knows what is going on over there."
1,"Well in the city of Boston, there is zero competition when it comes to cable. Neighborhoods are partitioned off for individual cable companies and residents  who cant get satellite service, like me  get stuck with whatever company owns your territory.  In my case, the company is Comcast and while they have a decent selection of channels, their service and price scale [is bad]. Living in Boston, we need to pay extra just to see the Red Sox on NESN. I can walk to Fenway in just 20 minutes, so you think I could see the games for free or at least as a minor add-on not in a package that includes premium channels like TBS, TNT, ESPN and Nickelodeon. Most other carriers call these channels basic.  But that is not the reason for my rant, it is their horrible customer service. My TV and DVR were on the fritz this weekend. During the Sunday NFL games, the screen would freeze and then break into pixels.  When I called up the customer service, the operator told me that I did not have an account even after reading my account number to them. After going back and forth for 10 minutes, the operator, who could not pronounce MassachusettsMaryland. So right there, the published customer service number does not work and then had to find an alternate number. in her broken English, told me that they could not access accounts.  After finding it, I was met with a nice fellow who could not access my box, because the box was frozen. With that they told me that they had to send out a tech and the only times available were during the day. So that would mean I would need to take off of work. He is looking into getting someone over here on Saturday. We will see what happens and I will report back with the update."
1, I am sick of COMCAST treating me like s***.  They have turned off the cable and want 500.00 to turn it back on.  I want the cable fixed or a refund of all the cable part of the bill that I paid. They did give a few credits but not near enough.  They have no right to take my money then refuse to service my account!!!!!!  Who do they think they are??????? 
1,"In late September '08, I called Comcast to request service in my new home.  I went with Comcast because it allowed me to keep my (at the time) home phone number.  I have a field-based office, so it was convenient to keep that number.  Waited 10 days.  They came out 10/6/08 and said they were stuck because they didn't know where the cable's underground conduit hooked to one of the hubs in the street.  He called out his supervisor.  No resolution.  On 10/10/08, another guy comes out (Binh) and turns out, same issue.    Supposedly, on 10/11, they were to send out the construction crew to figure out the underground conduit connection and I would get service shortly after that.  10/11, I saw no one come to my house.  I call Comcast and they say the construction crew has up to 10 days to get this work done!  This is 20 days added to the original request!  I place several phone calls and never got any resolution.  Couldn't even get a dispatch number to call the local area to tell them.  I gave them my cell phone number to have them contact me since my residential wans't working.  No one called.  From that point until 10/24, I had about 2 other crews come out.  Same issues. The horrible thing was, I would have to call in their 800# to see when I would get an appointment.  They never called me to schedule anything. Last Friday, I finally got connection.  the tech that came out was really nice and he did follow up when he left the premise to get equipment.  The internet and phone line finally worked.  Then the next day, 15 hours after I finally got service, I couldn't get internet access.  The phone line has NO dial tone.  From 10/25-10/26, I have called the 800# several times.  No one has resolved anything. I tried to write several letters to Rick.  Supposedly, their VP of Customer Service.  It's been 2 weeks.  No responses.    So I called the 800- number today and supposedly, there is an appointment scheduled, which I didn't know about.  But I am at home and so far, no one has contacted me.Inconvience, as I have a home office line that I need to have working, along with internet.  Inconvenience the last 4 days.  I have taken off 2 hours here and there for appointments, a total of 1.5 days of work.  Emotional distress.  No one wants to listen to me."
1,"On September 30th Comcast revised their terms of service to denote that a monthly bandwith cap of 250GB has been determined.  If a customer goes over 250GB two months out of the year, their service will be shut off.  On October 25th, Comcast announced they will no longer provide newsgroup service to its customers. Between those two periods, Comcast also sent letters to their customers informing them of rate increases. I called to inquire how my prices could possibly increase, and the service that Comcast provide decrease.  I spoke with several supervisors, yet no one could adjust my monthly rate, or explain why I am getting less for more.  If cable was not regulated I would have switched to one of Comcast's competitors a long time ago.  Comcast has a monopoly over its geographic customer base and it is unfair to consumers.  My prices went up and the service that Comcast provides declined."
1,"I have not received a cable bill for 3 months other than the one telling me I was  behind in my payment.  Despite repeated calls and emails informing customer service of this fact I have yet to receive this month's bill either.  Last month I paid an estimated bill on line, I suppose I have to do that again this month to avoid a late payment letter.  I don't know who else to talk to, any suggestions?"
1,"I have emailed the CEO at Comcast to dispute a negative report that has just popped up on my credit report because Comcast is stating that I owed them cable services from March - April of this year (2008). I told them repeatedly that I was not even living in Florida during that time and I already had a COMCAST account in Boston to show that I was not there. It seems that when they went to the house to disconnect cable at my request in 2007, somebody told them to not disconnect, then they signed for me, kept cable paid until 2008, and then let it go into default. I had no idea this was happening and my credit should not take the hit for this. They will not remove it, they blame me for it, and are asking for payment. This is wrong. I now have a recent negative report on all three credit bureaus. I just got a job working with NASA, that negative report could prove to be very costly. I stated my case, but they are just telling me that it sounds more like a domestic dispute since a realtive must have just continued the cable (but I asked them to disconnect it in my name). They did not, and since I moved i had no idea that this account went into collections."
1,"Service (internet and cable tv) out on 10/23/08, I called Comcast at 10p, rep said general service was being done in the area, should be up by midnight!  Friday, no internet or cable tv, called back, another rep says nope, no service was being done last night.  Tech sent out on Sat (2 days later!) Looks like a technichian came out to disconnect the neighbors line (on Thurs) and disconnected mine too!  Luckily the neighbor kept the work order so I have the service tech's number!  I have been LIED to by the very first person I contacted on Thursday night!  Tried to reach a supervisor 3 times, left messages and no call back yet! I pay for a service 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, I EXPECT that service for my money."
1,"I have had the same experience as many of the others complaining here.  I have had comcast as an internet provider for many years, but this year they became monsters from hell.  My triple play was to end in Feb. of 2007, so I called in january to find out what deals there were available.  The guy told me that they would like to keep me as a customer so they offered me the triple play again, all three services for $99.99/month, with HBO added in for free.  Nice offer!  I took him up on it.  It was supposed to be for a year. So in July they decide that they are going to add blast to my service, stop my triple play and tell me when I called in about my larger than normal bill that my bundle (triple play) had fallen off.  Fallen off?  WHAT???????So, they tell me I asked for the blast and they have the phone calls logged.  That I called them twice that day in July to add blast.  I NEVER CALLED THEM!  I didn't even know what the heck blast was.  They LIED to me over and over again.  Of course, your phone calls to Comcast are NEVER listed on your phone bill.  So, I finally get a manager that is sane after talking to about 6 other trained liars on the phone, and she admits that they have been doing this, adding without asking, and that she is willing to give me back the triple play.  She then asked me, as they SHOULD HAVE TO BEGIN WITH, if I wanted to try the blast for an added $9.99/month.  It was supposed to help connectivity, which I had been having issues with.  She says if I don't like it, I can cancel and keep the triple play for the remainder of my 12 month agreement.  I say, ok.  So, next billing cycle my bill is 30 bucks over what it is supposed to be.  Guess what???  Comcast never gave me back my triple play,, charged me ten bucks for the blast and 20 more dollars for whatever they rigged up for my new insane billing, that even the billing folks didn't understand.

"
1,"Fraudulent-Over Billing Practice, Did Not honor installation Promotion thus sending me an inflated bill as a result- -- I cancel my service for there failure to honor there promotion and have been disputing the over charges with Comcast for over 3 months now and no resolution to date has come from my efforts unfortunately my dispute has fell on deaf earsI returned all equipment and Comcast is still sending bills for charges and services that have been canceled and still trying to collect payment for the equipment that I returned I also received on my bill a bogus $50.00 charge on a September billI also gave them a $50 deposit for the service and have not received any adjustments to my account to reflect same."
1,"The service is by far the worst I have experienced. My internet service stops working in the middle of the night. My email service doesn't work. The last email received was 4 days ago. I discussed the problem with tech support. Our phone call was abruptly cut short at 9:00 PM when they leave for the night. Still no email.  MY video box quit working a couple of days ago. On Monday, the tech rep said he truly understood that it was not my problem. They could send a tech out the following Thursday. 4 days without service.    I'm done! Overcharged for a non working service. You will not be able to contact me because my email service does not work. Bill paid on October 17th and is current..."
1,"I am a customer of Comcast Cable. I became a customer because of the sweet deal they were offering to come on board. $250 dollars in rebates. Since I began my service, I have had nothing but very bad encounters with Customer Service its as if they are paying me to be a member of there network, but the truth of the matter is that I am paying them to treat me like I was dirt under there finger nails. The Customer Service is so bad, I suffer from headaches after a long hurry up and wait call with Comcast and the sad thing about it is they never resolve the issue... Comcast has hang up in my face...blind transferred me in the middle of a conversation, yell at me as if I was a child, refused to allow me to talk to a supervisor, lied to me about my contract.This list just goes on and on. I have never received my REBATE COMCAST..and they disconnected my service after I made a payment. I have not gotten a credit for all the time my cable was off due to Ike and they have decided to charge me for services in advance rather I like it or not.. I never agreed to this. I HAVE BEEN LIED TOO. And I am burning mad about it. I called the main office and talk to Lisa and was promise that they would call me back today to resolve my issues. HELLO LISA STILL WAITING. Comcast is a Joke. That poor customer service team is going to run the company in the ground. Oh by the way my phone is still off.. I am just...this is nothing but a nightmare... I just want to wake up. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST IF AT ALL POSSIBLE."
1,"4 days ago, Comcast Cable changed their email system without making instruction manuals available to their customers. Upon calling the Corporate Office and speaking with Cal, he in turn sent me a link for the tutorial. Unfortunately, it cannot be downloaded for your use. I called the 1-800 number for assistance, and come to find out that none of the customer service people were notified of the new system, therefore, couldn't help resolve the problem.I called my local office (Joseph **), and he confirmed that no-one had been trained on the new system, including himself. I pay over $100/mo for my service, and you would think that Comcast wouldn't use their customers as ""guinea pigs"" when their own employees haven't been trained on a product that we are forced to use through Comcast."
1,"Well in June '08, I find that an outside Comcast coaxial cable is frayed and some wires are sticking out - looks like an animal may have chewed the insulation off. I call Comcast to have them fix the problem. I am a very patient person... but after 2 months (yes, 2 months) and no service call, I call again to have someone come and fix the problem (silly me - I thought they would run a new line, but they instead patched the old frayed part of the line outside with some connectors).Last month Comcast was performing upgrades in our area. The result of this upgrade was that we had no internet service for 9 days. First appointment no one ever showed up. Finally, a few days and someone shows up and says the problem is because of some connectors the prior Adelphia person used in the attic. They replace said connector and the internet works... for 3 weeks. Then it goes out again. They say they cannot come out and fix this for yet another week. So, out of a month, we have service MAYBE 75% of the time. And they have the nerve to bill us for a full month. Now-the cable box isn't working and the tech help tell us to replace the box. We do that but said replacement does not work. They tell us no one is available until the latter part of next week. Horrible - their service is just horrible, and if FiOS or some other broadband were available, we'd jump on it in a second! We will probably be switching to satellite TV, which is much more reliable and their customer service is top-notch. And as soon as a broadband alternative comes around, Comcast will see us in their rear-view mirror!!!"
1,"Comcast is offering rebates of $200 for signing up for cable, internet and TV bundled packages. This is on their website. They offer this, but don't pay up. There are numerous sites on the web that list complaints from customers who never got their rebates from Comcast even though they tried and tried. It is apparent that Comcast is making it as difficult as possible. It is clear they want the consumer to give up and go away. A Google search of Comcast rebates or Comcast rebate complaints will pull up many sites with customer complaints. I can afford not getting the rebate, but feel sorry for the customers who are relying on it to help pay bills. It is the most brazen form of deception I have ever experienced.Here is my history: I filed the rebate form and they were received on 5/25/08. I was quoted 12 weeks for the rebate. It never came. They referred me to Check your rebate.com. I don't know what the relationship is between the two companies. I contacted Check your rebate and was told on 9/8 by rep# ** a check would be sent at the end of September. After not receiving the check, I was told the list was scrubbed by rep **. I am suppose to be on list to get a check on 10/20. I am very doubtful this will occur because after reading other customer complaints, I recognize that I am on the same path of frustration that other customers described. "
1,"Comcast has the WORST service department I have ever dealt with. I have taken off 18 days of work waiting for them and endless hours trying to set this up, and same problems with intermittent loss of phone and internet service still happens! Every time you call, they act as if this is the first complaint you have logged! I do not believe they know what they are doing! And you never get to talk with a supervisor or manager that can do anything more to help! This is the WORST I have ever experienced!!!! I HATE COMCAST!"
1,"They advertised free WII with triple play package. I called and ordered this 7/27/08. The lady told me the WII would be given at time installation. Tech did not have it. I called, was told be delivered in five days. Got letter instead, did what it said. Then called again, would have it 4-6 weeks. As of today, don't have. Now they are telling me I won't get because of being late payment, but I was never told that nor does any fine print say that. Have talked with several neighbors. They ordered this based on the free TVs and they got it either."
1,"Comcast uses Non Stop (an independent contracting co) that does their installing cable/internet. I have dealt with Comcast miserably in the past month for installation of service and many failed no show appointments. The technicians that do show up, are spaced out, smelling of pot smoke, or do not speak in English and well past their 3 hour time slot. Then they leave with the internet not running properly and lie and say it will be running in an hour. I have gone weeks without service because they can't return until the next available appointment. I am very very disgusted with Comcast and their choice of technicians. Once Verizon Fios comes out, I am never using Comcast again!"
1,"Comcast Cable Service over charging for its HD service. You must pay a $8 fee for each HD cable box, and then pay $6 more for each cable box that has HD service."
1,Internet is very slow and has been for at least a month --as slow or slower than dial-up. Four service attempts have been made --two at the house and two on the street. The speed is unchanged. Today I could not even reach Comcast as their call center is apparently too busy to handle the calls. Can I get out of my contract with this inferior service? I'm paying for high speed and getting low speed.
1,"I contacted Comcast as I was having problems connecting to the Internet after my son had gotten through fooling around with my computer. Unlike many of you who had problems with Comcast, I was rather hesitant to even deal with them after hearing all of your horror stories. To my delight, I spoke with a young gentleman who was more than willing to walk me through the troubleshooting process on my computer. As I am not the most savvy user in the world, I expected my new Comcast friend to become frustrated - he did not. He was wonderful. Although I needed to have a technician sent to my home to look at the problem, my call center experience was wonderful.The installation/service technician that came to my home was equally enjoyable and knowledgeable with the products and services his Company offered. As it turned out, the modem I had needed to be replaced. Was I mad at Comcast. No - they were wonderful. My modem was replaced, all of the television fittings in my home were checked, I was offered credit to my account for my inconvenience, and was given a business card with my technicians name on it with his cell telephone number should I have any problems down the road. I don't know about your poor experiences you've had with Comcast, but I can tell you, although they are a service provider, you get a lot more using honey than vinegar. I was respectful of the representatives efforts, which was reciprocated 10 fold. Think about that before you call and freak out!"
1,Service connection is SLOWER THAN SNAIL MAIL!!!!!!!! I actually have to get into MSN and quit going back to my Comcast home page to get decent service... Comcast home page SUCKS!!!! Slow connections!!!!
1,"For the past several months, our cable television on Demand service has been erratic at best. We have ordered movies and they cut out in the middle. Sometimes we have a blank screen on all channels. I have called repeatedly. I get either an excuse that they are improving the service or they are having problems in my area. Sometimes I get automated lines telling me they will send a new signal. That doesn't work. Then the automated service says it will call me back. They do and I get more automated service which again does nothing. I rarely talk to a human being. When I do, there is some excuse as I have mentioned before. We pay our bill every month. Then we don't get the service we have paid for."
1,"I recently moved into a house. I called and asked the sales representative 1 thing, can they reduce my bill. Comcast gave me a promotion that gave us more channels (more expensive than my basic package) and reduced our bill as compared to the previous plan we had by $15/month for 1 year. The only reason I didn't shop around more was because of this promo. 2 days after installation, our cable went off, and then I was told by Comcast, that they would reinstate it but I would have to call the sales department during business hours to get my promotion back. Which I did and they pretty much said that we got canceled because we were not eligible for the plan (it was for people switching from Dish). I argued with her for a bit but all I got was a condescending ""I'm sorry but you don't qualify and there are no promotions in your area."""
1,"I have tried to get Comcast to fix my service since 09/27/08, as of 10/08/08 I am still without service. I have called given my cell number to call to verify appointment, no one has called. I called myself today (10/08/08) gave my cell number again was told someone will call me today to find out what going on with my service. I received a called informing my service call was cancel due no answer. Which is crazy, you have my cell number!"
1,"I used to have the cable internet service and cable TV service with Comcast. My internet was cancelled about one and half years ago. My cable TV service was disconnected a few weeks ago. On the last bill, Comcast charges me $40 for a cable internet modem. I ordered the internet service in a Best Buy store and brought the self installation kit there. I have my own modem. I never order a modem from Comcast and never receive one. When I called them, e-mailed them and also visited their cable store, I am told that the inventory was out. When I asked if this is an error on their system, they said that their system never make mistake. I thought this may be an identity theft case and ask them for the information about when and how the modem was ordered and where and how the modem was delivered and the tracking number. None of them can give me any information. The phone rep points me to the cable store. The cable store said I have to call the service center. The e-mail rep asked me to call their hot line. I was told that there is an investigation. But the result is the same inventory out?.There is an entry CHSI Internet Buy Modem $0.00? for every statement when I had the internet service. If I have the Comcast modem, there is a $3 monthly rent. To me, the statement is a proof that I don't have the Comcast modem. But their phone rep and store rep wont buy this and say they can not take the charge off. I feel that a big company can't use inventory out? and our system never make error? as a proof to make the customer to pay for the product or service never ordered and never received. If Comcast gets its way, will it inventory out? a panel TV and bill the customer for thousands dollar?If their system is right, there was a modem went out under my name. This is an identity theft case. They are not cooperative and can't provide any order and delivery information. Their customer service is poor. The rep said that they can see only the current account balance. The cable store is even worse. When I tried to pay the balance exclude the $40 in question, they refuse to accept the payment."
1,"Since subscribing to Comcast, my wife and I have placed over 104 service-related calls due to services that do not function correctly. We have been put off, lied to, deceived and NEVER received the service for which we pay over $200.00 monthly. I can't even go into all of the disruption this has caused in our lives. Waiting for techs to show up... only to cancel. Endless hours waiting on the phone just to be brushed aside like dirt with money. We own several LCD TVs. The picture is snowy, green, blocked or non-existent. Our internet service - The modem shuts off daily 3-8 times. I know all the tricks on how to fix the problems because I have spent so much time with techs on the the phone. I can get the modem working, most of the time, but it takes me 20 min. or so each time it fails. That could be 3-5 times in one sitting. Our phone service fails when the modem goes off and tonight it is just sounding a busy signal when I pick up the receiver."
1,"October 2, 2008 - When I arrived home, I noticed that I had no cable TV, phone service, or wireless internet. Being that this was an important night (vice-presidential debate), I called Comcast (1-800-COM-CAST) immediately. I pressed 1 after dialing the number and reached a representative in their cable-TV department. I did not understand his first name, but continued to tell him of my problem. I first asked if there was any information in my record of the cable to my house being buried, since this was an initial problem when I first moved in (after having no Comcast service, a technician in 2007 replaced the cable after he noticed that the cable was exposed, and was cut by apparently the lawn service). He did not have any information on whether or not the cable was, indeed, buried. After a short conversation, he said that he could send a technician out the next day between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm. I told him that was not acceptable and wanted to have a technician out this evening and asked to speak to his supervisor. I was put on hold for a short time, and then he came back on the phone and told me that there was an outage in my area, and that the service technicians were on the problem. I asked again if there was indeed a problem in the area, and he said yes.I waited about 10 minutes and called Comcast back, and this time pressed 2, which was the Internet Service department. I spoke with a Katrina (last name not known). I asked Katrina if there was an outage in my area. She responded no. She noticed in my records that I had just called in earlier, and I told her of my conversation with unknown telling me that there was an outage in my area. Once again I asked to speak to a supervisor. I told her that the outage story was apparently just a blatant lie, because I asked that a technician be sent out that night. Katrina was helpful, in that she tried to send signals to my modem to fix the problem, however, when that failed, she returned to tell me that there was, in fact, a problem outside, and that she was going to see if a technician could come out to fix it that evening. Unfortunately, I was put on hold, and then disconnected.Third call: This time I called Comcast back and, once again, pressed 2  for Internet Service hoping to speak with Katrina. I reached a Marie who I told my story to for the third time. She said that the quickest way to get service out to me would be to transfer me to cable-TV department, which she did. Victor answered the call. After repeating my story for the fourth time, Victor assured me that there was no outage in my area. I asked to speak with his supervisor, apologizing to him that I was just getting frustrated, and wanted to get the problem resolved that night. I was put on hold for a short time, and Victor returned to tell me that there was a general problem in the area until 11:00 PM that night. I asked if I could still speak to the supervisor, and he said he was unavailable. I then asked what his supervisor’s name was, and he said Ruth.  I have no idea whether this was a first or last name, but Victor said his/her employee ID number was **.  Strangely, I could hear the supervisor Ruth giving Victor his/her ID number in the background.Friday, October 03, 2008 - Since I still had no cable TV, internet, or telephone service at 6:30 AM, I called Comcast back to schedule a service appointment on my way in to work (approximately 8:30 AM). I was told that no service technician was available until Saturday. I initially scheduled my appointment for Saturday between 9:00 AM and noon. The representative asked if I wanted a 30-minute call before the technician arrived, and I declined. When I arrived at work at 9:00 AM, I called Comcast back and told [name unknown] that I would prefer the 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM service call, and that I would indeed like the technician to call before his arrival. The representative told me that if I did not answer the phone when he/she called, they would not show up. I asked what number they would be calling, and he said my home number. I reminded him that since I did not have any service from Comcast, how could I possibly answer my home phone, if it was not working? I then gave him my cell phone number for the 30-minute advance call.Saturday, October 04, 2008 - 8:30 AM, Bill, the Comcast service technician, called me on my cell phone and showed up at my house within five minutes. I showed him the box, which is located in my neighbor’s backyard, and also the exposed cables located in the common area. The first thing he noticed was that my temporary cable installed a year ago (September 2007) by Comcast was never replaced, nor was it buried. He also said that my neighbor, who has Comcast internet only, was sharing my line. When he was done with his repairs, I was told by the technician that the Comcast repairman that repaired my neighbor’s internet connection, cut my line intentionally, so that my neighbor could not receive free cable-TV or phone service, thus cutting off my service entirely.First of all, the deceitful responses that I have experienced from the Comcast representatives after my initial service calls are revolting. In addition, to not be able to speak with a supervisor, who was never available (even though one was apparently standing next to the representative, giving him his/her employee ID number) is very poor judgment on Comcast’s behalf and bad PR. I have all intentions to report this to every governmental agency to expose Comcast’s conniving methods to deceive their customers.I would also recommend that Comcast hire more intelligent people in their call center. It is obvious, that the most common response that their employees are taught is, ""I am sorry but that is not possible."" They obviously have no idea what they are talking about. However, this is not their fault, this is the fault of their supervisors, who should be reprimanded. I can only assume that because Comcast has a monopoly in this area, that they feel they can do whatever they please. Common Virginians stand up against this monstrosity. If you have (or have had) an issue such as mine with Comcast, please voice your opinion."
1,"On 1-30-07 we had Comcast HDTV installed and since then we have had at least 60 service calls and several inches of records we have kept. Our TV picture still goes out, says One Moment Please (sometimes for days) and in general we have very undependable service. I have not usually called until a problem persisted for days but have decided to start calling each time we have a major problem. Maybe a call every other day will wake them up!"
1,"I scheduled the cut-off of cable TV and internet service at my apartment in Houston, TX for Sept 30. The person taking the call said No problem, we leave it on a day or two in case there are delays. I am watching TV Monday evening, Sept 29, and the cable TV service is cut. I called COMCAST and asked why my service was cut off. I was told that the service cancellation order showed Sept 29. I ask why would I schedule the TV to be turned off on the 29th when I am staying through the 30th. She insists that I must have scheduled it for Sept 29 because they do not make up the dates. She did try to turn the service back on but her system insisted that a charge would be applied to restore service. They apparently do not keep a record of calls nor do they have a way to restore service when they get the dates wrong. If they make an error, that's too bad. You have to pay to correct their mistake."
1,I do not like Comcast. It runs slow so I tried to do a clean registry and didn't follow through when they wanted me to pay and now I can't get rid of the popup on the screen about the registry scan. How do I get rid of it and how do I get to your chat room. When I'm working on something it always flips back to the sign in page. I hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"I received this email today from Comcast: ""Dear Comcast High-Speed Internet Customer, As of October 25, 2008, the complimentary Comcast Newsgroups service, powered by Giganews, will be discontinued. This feature provided customers access to 2 gigabytes of newsgroup information on a monthly basis. After this date, these customers will no longer be able to access the Comcast Newsgroups service through Comcast.""This is part of Comcast's continuing effort to reduce service, but keep charging me the same high monthly fee. They are dropping the news service with less than 30 days notice and not offering any replacement except at an additional cost to me. So I get less service from Comcast without any reduction in my monthly charges. One of the reasons I subscribed to Comcast was for their news group service. This is something I use on a daily basis. No they are removing it without any replacement. I can subscribe to Giganews on my own, but at additional cost. This is not fair. I should not have to pay more for the same service that I agreed to when I subscribed. Comcast is using this to make more profits for them while lowering service to me as a customer. They need to replace this service with an alternative if they cannot continue with Giganews and do so at the same cost to me."
1,"I typically don't write to complain, but I'm completely fed up with your poor customer service of Comcast. As soon as AT&T U-verse comes, I'm never returning, even willing to pay double what they charge; unfortunately, in Houston thanks to Congress they have a cable monopoly. Real fair!! I'm also writing a letter to the BBB. I would love for you to look up my account and see how many calls I've made to get people out to my house to put in an amplifier since apparently the signal is too weak. I've been at my new house since 8/15/2008. It's October and I still don't have service. I've called multiple times like I just did when I was on hold for over 20 minutes, then cut off. I just received my latest bill that charges me the NCAA Football season. I called to order one game which after an hr on the phone and still problems with their system, according to Comcast, nothing was ever fixed, no games, but yes the charges seem to work perfectly on my bill. After I tried to cancel because I missed the only game I was interested in, and my receiver was not working they told me I couldn't get out of it. So not only did I get charged for $129, on top of everything they then proceeded to charge me $24.95 on top of it for some sort of customer trouble call? Hmmm... that's fair! I called because it wasn't working and I got charged. I'm very close to violence and now understand why people go postal! We've had people show up 2 hrs before our scheduled appts, no show, and show but not installing what we need (amplifier) which I've called 15 times about. My wife has taken time off work to meet with Comcast completely inadequate repairmen and have cost us money. I'm going post this message on all internet outlets to let people know about this poorly managed, poorly run, poorly adequate cable system, no wonder they lose thousands of subscribers to the satellite companies... I've also noticed how when you call to billing or cancel, they don't answer or you're on hold until you give up. Nice job George Bush helping corporations screw tax payers when we pay your salary... **!!"
1,"4 months ago I had a terrible pixing problem (picture & Sound keeps going off and on constanthly. technical people were out to my home 3 to 4 times and did not cure the problem. As early as September 13,2008 (the last visit from tecnical.The tech told me that the problem is not in my house but in the main system that serves this area. He said he would report this to the Company and have them fix the problem. Of course as of today the problem is not fixed. I call the Company and nothing is done to adjust the problem. I feel at this point in time all monies that I paid to them should be refunded. I am receiving only 1/4 of what I pay for. I pay Comcast at least $113.00 per month. I don't know where else to go with this because at this point in time I get sick in the stomach and mentally punished from watching my TV. Physical damage is stomach whezzyness and headachs. Economicly this unfair situation wants me to cancel their service but unfortunetly you can't because there are no other cable companies to use."
1,held on hold for 30 minutes. seems that the comcast company is understaffed and staff is not informed. the guy i spoke with said my service was working ? No way since no one in my condo has theirs working! This is my 16th day without service. my bill for this month sould only be for the days I had sevice. WE need more competion.
1,"I have been a Comcast Customer since 9/2004. I subscribe to LTD Basic Service and Digital Preferred.  I've been able to receive all basic cable channels as well as digital.  On 9/26/2008, I click the remote to Comedy Central ch. 49 and the TV screen read NOT AUTHORIZED.  I tried other channels under 100 and the same message flashed on the screen.  When I contacted Comcast on 9/27/2008, I was informed by the customer rep. that Digital Preferred was not in existance and that is why I'm not authorized for those channels. I was also further informed that Channels 29-99 are not considered basic cable.  Since Comcast learned of the mistake they stopped authorizing transmission on all my channels except 2-23. Comcast did this without notifying me whether it was by letter or phone call or e-mail.  I, the customer, had to contact Comcast to find out what happened.  I was also told that if I want all the channels re-instated I had to upgrade and pay $93 per month rather than the $54 per month that I was paying up until 9/27/2008.  I would not have made an irate phone call to Comcast had I been sent written notice of the mistake and my options.  I felt bullied into upgrading or I would be left with a digital box and network TV. I am now paying an additional $39 (not including tax) per month for the same service I received until 9/26/2008.  I was not offered any compensation for Comcast's mistake.  I want Comcast to provide cable service to me without the additional cost for 30 days until I have considered my options, such as switching cable companies. After considering my options and Comcast offers the better deal, I would agree to the upgrade."
1,"I have a problem with both cable and internet service (going on Monday from semi-service to non-service at all on Wednesday) I call on Wednesday, they send someone on Friday. Technician says there's nothing he can do, it's a wiring problem, they will send people to fix it on next Wednesday and everything will work as usual. On Wednesday, I call for a refund being sure the problem will be resolved. Customer service representative cannot help me in any sense. I ask for the supervisor, supervisor Kenya Boughs, or something alike, was not understanding, called me a lier, and could not resolve a thing. People came, though, I expected to have service, these people said they will check on my connection. Never came. I call again Comcast to schedule (AGAIN) an appointment, they gave one today on Friday at 11:00.I had to work but I delayed my duties in order to wait for the technician. He did not came at 11:00. I called customer service. They told me they will came sometime between now and 6 pm. I recalled him that my appointment was at 11:00, he said he will call me back to update the status. So far, no telephone call at all.  Calling customer service is painful: nobody can resolve any problem, have more than 20 to 40 minutes listening to music and at the end, there is no resolution at all. I belong to a french and a hispanic community and believe me,I will not just cancel my account but also I will start a campaign to persuade all my friends and acquaintances to drop their accounts with Comcast based on my bad experience not just with the service but especially with representatives. Frustration. Work days delayed."
1,Why and how does comcast have the right to take EWTN off our cable .  We want them to reinstate it as soon as possible.  
1,"I wanted to transfer cable/high-speed internet service to a new address. Called Comcast and was told that there would be no charge for the transfer and it could all be done over the phone. That's where the nightmare began.       I told the Comcast CSR that I would be moving within the next three days but wasn't exactly sure when. The Comcast CSR told me that he could work it out so my service would overlap so I wouldn't lose any service at either location. Great!, I told him. Two hours later I lost my internet connection and then my cable TV. So I'm stuck at the old address for three days with no internet or cable. So I finally move to the new address excited get my cable and internet again. Remember, the CSR told me it could all be done over the phone. It can't. I moved a few things into the new location and excitedly hooked up my internet and cable equipment. No cable or internet. Called Comcast and asked them what could be the problem. We'll have to send out a technician they say. But I was told that it could all be done over the phone I say. I don't know who told you that they say. We have nothing on record stating anyone told you that. Comcast always says things like that. Four days later, the Comcast tech shows up. So I'm out of service for a week due to the incompetence of the Comcast CSR's.      I call to cancel the tranfer after a day of service. I move back to my old address and try to explain the situation to the Comcast CSR. No problem they say at Comcast. The transfer never went through and we can take care of this over the phone. They tell me I won't be charged since the transfer never went through.       A couple of weeks go by and I get a bill from Comcast for $231.72 for my service at the transfer address. I had just paid $167.46 for my old address. Called Comcast and they told me that the computers send these letters out automatically and not to worry because  I wouldn't be charged.       Two months go by and I get a letter from CMI collection agency. Now, my perfect credit rating is in jeopardy because the Comcast Cable CSR's are not trained very well. Comcast sent my charges to a collection agency. Now my perfect credit rating is in jeopardy because Comcast has CSR's that don't know what they are talking about and give false info."
1,"we ordered comcast for three rooms an only two has all the chanels. one room doesnt have all the chanels. i dont under stand it. we ordered all the chanels that was required. why hasnt anyone came out to fix this problem, they say we have to pay another 19.95 for them to come out to fix this problem. should of program all the chanels in when supposed to of did it in the first place. we paided our bill and noone came out yet. noone has talk to us about it just gave us a runaround. telling us you have to pay. why shoud we pay  "
1,"Last week, one of my two comcast box was not working on ON Demand.  I called comcast and the lady on the phone said we will send people to your house to fix it neither try anything online nor tell me thre will be a charge on me.  The second day one person came and said: this is simple.  What you need to do is just disconnect the power and reconnect it.  They should try it online first instead of sending me here.  When I saw the bill this month, there was more than $28 charge for this service.  I called back and they said because I dont have protection plan so each time when the Cable, internet or telephone have any problem and they need to send people to my house and will charge on me.  I was watching TV on On Demand today.  Sundenly the picture was stopped and then ON Demand has err.  No more working.  So if I called them they will send people to my house and charge me $28 again.  So if their service has problem they I have to pay the service fee each time?  I paid more than $100 each month and it should include I can watch the program normally.  If there is any service problem they should be respossible for it, not customer.  COMCASTs service is getting bad.  They just allure you into their trap then charge you each time when you say help and you cant go because you have contract with them.  It is not fair! I want them to stop cheating customers and credit my $28. So I can't watch Movies on ON Demand wich I alway paid it. I am afrid they will cahrge me $28 agian if I call them."
1,"I signed up for comcast triple play, cable tv w/on demand, phone service and internet service for 129.00 with 2 year agreement.  Note: I already had the inernet and tv cable service for over 5 years for about 104.00 with taxes.  My bills were already paid up to date with the overlap of adding the phone service in the midst of a billing period.  tecnically I should only owe about 25.00 plus taxes for the phone service from prior billing statement, Instead they charged me an extra 65.00 for the overlap.  Basically they charged me twice for iternet service and tv cable (at a prorated amount, but I should not have been charged for these two servcies at all since prior two billing statements show these two services were paid in full.  I called 5 times and each time they  pretend they don;'t see it and just say it's because I changed services in the midst of a billing cycle.  I said how can you possibly charge someone twice duiring the same time period for 2 out of three servcies that are already paid up to date!  I get the same answer...it's because I switched servcies in the middle of billing cycle.  they will not give me a credit for double billing me for 2 out of three services already paid. rip off.  This should be illegal.  Bottom line, for my first month of new triple servcies I added it up to 169.00 instead of the 129.00 promised (I am not counting taxes or set up charge.  This is just for internet, phone service and tv cable.Overbilled , paid twice for same services during a specific time period."
1,"I was attempting to explore service options as my Comcast bill is set to rise from appoximately $130 a month to around $200, which I can not afford. I discovered that the other local cable company is NOT ALLOWED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVUIDE SERVICE to the apartment complex where I live as COMCAST PAYS THE PROPERTY OWNERS WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY BRIBE MONEY TO KEEP THE OTHER CABLE COMPANY OFF OF THE PROPERTY THUS ELIMINATING ANY COMPETITION. Is it legal for Comcast to pay to keep other competitors out? I am positive that this is not an isolated incident and that they must be doing this at many properties. PLEASE HELP US!The damage is higher prices as there are very limited service options since competition is prohibited."
1,"I signed upfor Comcast digital double play package. I of course gave my address where the service was to be. I then learned that Comcast CANNOT provide the service that they are still advertising as available and that the service would cost me much more than advertised. When I called to find out why they could notprovide the servce and why they were still advertising the service, I was told by JENNIFER that well, I could pay more if I wanted. I don't need a smart [alec] clerk receptionist AKA account executive to tell me I can pay more. Comcast should'nt be able to play bait and switch."
1,I paid the cable bill by check. COMCAST did not credit my account the $165 amt for the entire amt of the bill. I faxed the canceled check to COMCAST (Keisha). COMCAST turned off my service last night. I called Keisha again and she said she couldn't do anything about it unless I paid an additional $165 and she would talk to her supervisor about it. EMOTIONAL DISTRESS and COMCAST IS DOUBLE CHARGING ME!
1,"I have never really had any outage problem with Comcast; it's the way they do business that gripes me.  I am a pro football fan, so imagine my joy when Comcast brought in the NFL Network a couple years ago and put it in their basic package line up.  The following year, Comcast moved the NFL Network up into their sports tier package which requires additional cost per month. I could not justify the added expense as the NFL Network would have been the only channel I would watch in the entire sports package.   All the while, Comcast is in a lawsuit with the NFL Network over ... you got it ... money. The consequences are purely economic.  I thought 2 years would have been enough time to work out the differences between Comcast and the NFL Network.  Since Comcast will not move the NFL Network back to the basic package where it belongs, they lost my subscription.  As a matetr of fact, when the Verizon tech was installing cable TV service, we chatted about other services, and I decided to go full speed and get internet as well.  The Verizon tech was genuinely enthusiastic about their product.  Every time we deal with Comcast, they just seem only lukewarm about their offerings. I would have been originally disappointed if Comcast STARTED the NFL Network in a premium package.  But to start it in a basic package, THEN move it to a premium package, well, that smacks of nothing else but GREED.  And this time, it has costed Comcast all of their services to my residence."
1,"Comcast high speed internet.  Outlook email, unable to receive messages - error message 0x800CCC92.  (I can still send through Outlook, but I have to use Comcast web mail to receive my emails.)  Comcast tech support checked my settings then told me they do not support Outlook and that it must be a Microsoft problem.  Microsoft support shows this error happens when the ISP has not updated their Exchange Server.  So they are both blaming each other, and I still cannot receive email through Outlook.Very timeconsuming to use web mail and at the same time not have easy access to Outlook folders."
1,"Comcast Cable service technician came to my residential address to install cable on July 10, 2008. He left several feet of cable loose and did not secure it. He also did not install the cable correctly. My husband and myself have tripped several times on this excess cable. I now have a swollen ankle from repeated accidents. I have indicated to comcast that I will not pay for installation when it was not received. Comcast also has been overcharging an amount of $70.49 for cable when the special is for $43.00 a month. I have called several times to resolve the issue and they play phone tag between Mexico and India. They refuse to provide a local office number. I don't know what else to do.Physical damage is I cannot walk without pain."
1,The phone reps are rude un-proffessional people. I've been dealing with comcast for the past 4 years not because i like them it's because i don't have any other options. I would change my service in a heart beat if i had another option that can provide cable TV and Internet.
1,"I originally signed up with Comcast for their internet service, after talking to the representative I decided to get the all three of the services. The tech had a appointment set between 2pm-4pm. After numerous calls the technician came at 9pm. He did not complete the job until after midnight. Days later I notice that the television is recieving poor reception and the internet is going in and out. I perceeded to call comcast again and another technician came out and we were told that the original technician had not connected the services properly, meaning he never connected the service from the pole. Now service is good until we move August 1, 2008. Technician came out setup cable, internet and phone. One week later we are expericing the same original problems with the internet and the television. I call and speak to a customer service representive that state that they are going to write up a ticket and some will be giving me a call within 24hours. Never happen. Call back one week later. Same scenario. No call. So I decided to just set up an appointment so they can come out. Appointment was set for Sunday September 7, 2008 from 8-10am. No call No show. So of course I call Comcast only to be told that they rescheduled my appointment. So we rescheduled for today September 15, 2008. Appointment time was for 8-10am. Guess what? No call No show! So again I call and speak to a supervisior who states that the appointment had been rescheduled. She apologizes and gave a 20.00 credit and a free premium channel. Not 10 minutes after I get off the phone with her and my newly rescheduled appointment a tehnician shows up at the door. Who states Oh, they just rescheduled your appointment and I not doing an appointment that they just rescheduled. So I ask for the supervisor name and he would not give me the information. I asked his name in which I got a Mario. I asked again for the supervisor name and was told to call Comcast. So here we go again. I call and was told that he should have done the job and that they would get someone out there and I recieved another credit, for how much don't know and don't care. This is the worse service known to man!The damage is that I pay my bill on time and don't get full service."
1,My service with Comcast is absolutely horrific.  The picture keeps going off and on.  It does not happen on all of the stations just some of them.  My TV is less than two years old and I thought I would have really good TV.  Well it isn't the TV it is the cable.  I have tried to contact [the] company and all I get is enter number so and so and after twenty minutes of all of this garbage I finally get a real person and then I end up getting disconnected.  I have been trying for a month to talk to SOMEONE - ANYONE and get nowhere.  I am really fed up with my comcast service.  I have the internet and it is so difficult to use I went back to AOL.  I pay for comcast internet but I SURE DO NOT USE IT.  I just feel totally ripped off my COMCAST. 
1,"I have not had On Demand since I started service on June 3rd, 2008. I have reported this several times and two technicians have come to my house to repair the problem.  No one at Comcast can find out what is wrong!  Today is Sept. 11, 2008 and I still do not have On Demand, but I am being charged for this service.  I have been told by rep's at Comcast that they are working on the problem, with no date as to when it will be repaired.  I am very upset with the lack of service that I have received from Comcast and resolution for this."
1,"Upon subscribe for Comcast triple play almost one year ago, I had nothing but dissapointments with the service. Phone doesnt work major of the times, sound is terrible and many times just go silente on both sides of the conversation, Internet losses connection quite often. After 3 technicians show up finaly one realized that the under ground cable outside the house needed to be replaced. The internet and cable did benefit from it for the last month I havent had any problems, but with the phone same problem remains and we have tried diferent phones. I just received last statement where I am being charged extra $28 dollares for the maintenance. When I question if I was suppose to be paying for something that it never worked correctly and special from a bad cable outside of the house the representative told me yes because I dont have insurance just like when you by a cell phone you by insurance same here for the wire maintenance. The good news about it is that I argued and argued and got those $28.00 credite plus requestedanother credit for 30 dollares for the time I lost service and I was granted.  I really just want people to know my story and I am planning in finding another provider, Considering that my phone can not stand one single conversation without going mute or the voice cut in and out. Interruption of service. running my busines from Home for most of the time and cant use the phone  and previously couldnt depend on the internet."
1,"My Internet and phone service had been down for about 1 week, I finally got time in my schedule to call and setup an appointment for a tech to come out and resolve my issue.  When on Sunday September 7th, a techinician came out and first off he was told that my cable wasn't working which I pointed out that it was, he then checked my cable signal and said he didn't know why my cable was working, he then went outside to my cable box, did something and when he came back in, all three service were off.  So now only did he not resolve my issue but now I'm out of watching cable tv as wwell.  I called comcast support three times on that day and finally was tranfered to a guy named Eric in Montarrey Mexico.  Comcast has by far in my concern the worst trained technicians and there customer support is the worst I have ever encountered.  I mean I was livid when a so called trained tech can come into a customer's house and tell him well I don't know why this is working and after he leaves, he leaves with nothing working.I was frustrated, very upset and jsut had a horrible Sunday."
1,"When I queried about a newer box, I was told that it was too expensive for Comcast to upgrade to newer boxes. You would think that with all the new HD TVs being sold, that they would have newer boxes with the HDMI connections. With HDMI you have 1 small cable connection instead of the very heavy component cable that they supplied me. It weighs so much that it keeps pulling the connectors out. I was also told that what I have is sufficient. So, I guess that having a monopoly means you don't have to give the customers anything good or up to date, but just what is sufficient.I have all new equipment in my entertainment center which is my living room. The room that is viewable by most visitors/guests. With Comcast all I get is a very used looking HD cable box to display with all my nice attractive looking TV and equipment. Also, I can not use the current HD connections (HDMI). I have lost time away from work using up vacation days. I have had a loss of service each time the boxes fail, but I have had no reimbursment. When this box fails, my next time off from work will be to watch the technicians hook up a satallite dish."
1,I went online to sign up for comcast cable and internet. When I put in my address and phone number the site says that both are available to me. I then called to schedule the connection and was told that I couldn't get it. I called 1800comcast to ask why. I was told by a lady that it was available to me and that they would call me back to schedule connection. In a couple days I called back. Andrea told me that there was no problem it was just never hooked up at this address and that they would schedule the appointment as soon as a tech was available. The next day Andrea called and left me a voicemail message stating that the tech said that there is not service down my road and they can't provide service to me. I called again on 9-2-08 to find out why they say I can get it and then say no. Patty told me that now they have it in the system as not servicable as of the 21st of Aug. She said the tech said that I am 4 miles from the service box. I think they should have to provide me with service after them telling me I can get cable and internet. I also have the email from Romeo stating that these services are available to me. I want them to provide me with cable and internet like they told me they could.I now have to use dial up and have no tv for my kids to watch. I am trying to work online and it is impossible to do so with dial up. I am losing money and I am a single mother with 13 and 14 year old daughters.
1,"   My mom had basic cable for years because that's all she could afford. About a year ago, I started paying for her cable and upgraded her to a better package so she could watch things like cnn and the weather channel.For the past year, we've had nothing but problems with comcast.  To begin with, in order to upgrade her services, Comcast said that it had to come out to the house and install new cable boxes.  They gave my mom a specific time and day, and my mom had to take a half day off of work for that.They were supposed to be there between noon and 5 p.m.  What happened was that they came at 11 a.m., worked only on the outside box, never left her a note or called her to tell her that they were on their way or there or what they had done.  She called 3 different times to Comcast to ask why they hadn't arrived (after 5 p.m.).  Only with the 3rd person did she find out what happened.  The other two said that there was no listing of anyone showing up.  They then tried to walk her through the tv setup process with the remote control, which my senior citizen mom had trouble with (they should have done this before they left). Finally, it all got to working, but my mom was a mess by the time it was done.  Not only that, but it turned out that she didn't really need to be there and didn't have to take time off of work.  So right there they cost her a half-day's pay. Then, over the past 8 months my mom has had periodic issues with the cable just going out.  Twice there have been cable guys to come and look, and while initially they say that her tv is broken, before they leave they figure out that it's their cable box on top of the tv.The first time it happened they replaced her cable box with an older, refurbished version.  That one broke within 4 months.  They then came back out, tried to tell her it was the tv again, til they figured out it was the cable box, and then replaced the refurbished model with a new one.  That worked fine til a month ago.  Now the tv is having the same problem and she has called several times to customer support to get help.  Half of the time she gets people who don't speak english clearly and she ends up not getting any help at all.  When she does talk to someone who speaks english well, they try to tell her that it sounds like her tv is broken (yet again).They've told her more than a few times over the phone that she needs a new tv, rather than send another cable guy out there to diagnose the real problem.  My mom and I are done.  I refuse to pay the $58/month for this kind of service and product, and my mom is tired of not being able to watch tv.  We just ordered Directv for her and it's going to be installed on Saturday.  It will be a great satisfaction to cancel the comcast account.

1,"I checked the internet by inputting my address and was informed that our residence was servicable.  I then called to double check since we live out in the country and we did not have service prior.  I was again informed that we were able to get their services for phone, cable, and internet.  I set up an appt for a tech to come out.  The tech came out and determined we were not serviceable but didn't bother to tell us that.  I then called 1-800-Comcast as was then informed we were not serviceable and it was a computer error on their part that led them to believe we were servicable. They did offer to come out to see if they could drop a line for us to have service and I was supposed to receive a call back that day.  Never heard from anyone and then received an email that I order was cancelled with no one ever calling us to see if they were able drop a line.I had already cancelled my Direct TV service and my satellite internet because I had confirmed by the internet and phone that we were serviceable.  I know have to incur service charges to reinstate my service with my internet and Direct TV."
1,"   Twice no-show! On Aug. 14th I placed an order which includes High speed internet and basic cable. It was schedualed to install these service between 2pm to 5pm of Aug. 27th. I waited at home and nobody came. Then I called 3017357893 and was told to have a second schedule between 5pm to 8pm of Aug. 28, this time again no one showed up! (I even openned my door. If the tech guy did come, I would definitely not miss him/her) They wasted me two half-days, and what's more importance I can not use internet at home!  A few minute ago I called the custom service and was told they had nothing to do but just to rearrage my installation after Sep. 11. I have already waited for so long time. It is so unfair to me that the comcast people didn't show up and then again put me into the end of a long queue! Let alone they wasted me two half-days waiting at home. I am writing to ask for getting the high-speed internet and basic cable installed as soon as possible."
1,"I tried to get comcast phone/internet/cable in a small commercial building after waiting in line for 30 minutes the teller told I have to call Lee. Well Lee doesn't answer his phone or return calls. All the comcast numbers in the phone book are disconnected or fax machines. There are no other options, no competition. Is there a government organization that could look into this? Networks do not broadcast here."
1,"After 5 months they are still billing me for both personal and business accounts, even after I terminated residental services.  I have called and in ONE DAY spoke to no less than 13 people.  Still is unresolved.  Now they have cut my services.  I have made payments to personal account, but they will not apply these to my business account.Loss of business from termination of services at their mistakes."
1,"picked up cable box from novato comcast. Gave an old box with DVR and no hidef which is what I wanted. Found out I am being charged for a hidef box. Comcast says my box is hi def. it is not! it is an old box with No hd capability and my television is not even hidef capable. But they have been charging me 6.99 a month extra for a hi def service that I can't get because I don't have a hi def box and they are charging me an additional 6.99 to receive the hi def signal.  They just said sorry according to our records it is a hidef dvr box. Well I have a hidef dvr box on my 1080P television. The box I have on my old television is not the same it is a different make and model. The lady whom I got the box from at comcast specifically told me that this was not a hi def box. Good. That is exactly what I wanted.  A low def box with DVR capapbility.  Thats what I got but am being charged for a hideff box 6.99 and another 6.99 access fee.  $14.00 a month. Not only did they not fess up to their mistake, they wouldn't even go back and correct it. Then if I want someone to come out to correct the situation they want to charge me money to fix the situation. This is outragous. I have never worked with such an arrogant company. Monopolistic attitude is pervasive throughout this organization, but worse they think it is o.k. to steal from their customers. Unbelievable. $14.00 a month for the last 8 months for starters. $112.00.  29 minutes and 42 seconds of my life wasted trying to get to the bottom of these excessive charges."
1,"I have had Comcast services for some years and never realy had a problem until recently. One of the services is high speed internet with email. About 8 months ago I lost my email-out function, although the email in is fine.After calling numerous times and getting a different rep each time with a different answer, but no solution I found complaints on line similar to mine.It seems many people like myself have had some of their account info used for sending spam. I have never sent spam in my life and this seems to be a problem of Comcast's. Their easy solution is to block our email-out without an explaination or refund.- T. ClancyThis is a service that I need and rely on and they are illegaly charging for it without suppling the service."
1,"Constantly having problems with Digital Voice, Cable and Internet Service. Constantly calling them OVER and OVER again. They have the most incompetent bunch of illiterates I have ever spoken to in my life. I am so frustrated! I wish I can cancel there service but they are the only cable company in my area. "
1,"We have had Comcast for several years and it has slowly gotten worse. We have the televison,internet and phone service through them. When ever it rains even a sprinkle, all three services go out. On the 13th of the this month they sent out a tech who told me my problem was not in the house but on the box outside. He said squirrels could have gotten into it. He told me someone else would need to come over for that. I ended up having to hire someone to work for me at my shop that day just to be told he was not the one who needed to be sent out.  I asked him if I  needed to be here for the tech outside and he said no. Yesterday and today my entire service was out again from the rain and they said they had repaired that problem on the 15th. I told them I was having the same problem and wanted new service equipment run or I would be cancelling their service. They were suppose to be here between 11-2 and it is 4:06 no show.Other people that I have spoken to that have Comcast do not have this problem. They say they have pixeling, but they have not lost servive as much as I do. There is no problem when the sun is shining. I have paid for service that I am not getting. I keep track of non-service only to be told that unless I report it I cannot have it deducted. I can't report it when I do not have phone service. I have had to pay some one to work for me at my business to be home."
1,"We moved from one side of Lafayette to the other.  I was told by Comcast to  bring my equipment to the new location and a transfer of my services would be  completed.  The Comcast employee who came yesterday, was a contractor and  assured me that all services had been sucessfully transferred.  Before he left, I checked for a dial tone, my email and television stations.  I did not call my home number from my cell number, which I should have as my telephone number was changed without  any notification to me.  I noticed the change when I logged on this morning to retrieve my email messages.  At the bottom of log-on page it states how many new emails and voicemails I have received per email address or telephone number. Had I known that my telephone number of  21 years would change due to digital issues by Comcast, I would have switched  back to AT&T.  So far, customer service has pretty told me sorry, there's  nothing we can do.  Mark, a supervisor (ID #34185) ,stated it would be at least 48 hours before they would know if they could retrieve my  number from back from A T&T.  I have ordered checks with our new address and home business cards.    Please Help!A side note:  the Comcast voicemail system goes down often.  We lost a lease as the lease agent called left a message which I wasn't able to retrieve for three days.  We needed a quick answer and thought she was dragging her heals.  She is a high strung individual and so we didn't want ot bombard her with calls and waited until she called back - a message we received too late.*Checks need to be reprinted. *lost lease on a Moraga condo *Stationary needs to be reprinted. My time to contact friends, family, school and business contacts of telephone number change."
1,"I switched to them in February from a satellite company because they promised me a bundled rate of $60 for 12 months. Now I am being charged $100 a month. I got 1 extra service (HBO) and I have 3 boxes, of which I pay $7 extra a month for (all of which I got when I signed up for the service and I was paying the $64,79 as promised). I got rid of the HBO because that was $16 more a month. I still have the $4 starz package.   The person on the other end told me that the rate for the internet that I was getting was only for 6 months. Yes, that was supposed to be a part of my 12 month bundled service.   I tried to get rid of STARZ just now and they said they would have to charge me $5 just to delete it.  So when I got that news I told the girl I wanted to speak to a supervisor. She said there were none currently available. I told her I would wait.  So I waited.   And waited.  And waited.  I waited for over an hour (my phone has a minute timer on it) and still no supervisor.   I finally hung up. I am disgusted that I am a PAYING (never been late) customer.   Does anyone know what I can do to maybe get my rates back down? I already told on the other end that I was offered a better deal with dish network and she IGNORED it. other than losing an hour and 12 minutes of my time i am losing about $40 a month."
1,"Approximately a month ago, my cable TV was giving me problems.  I called Comcast during the week and spoke to a rep who told me Comcast could not come out during the week because they don't come out after 5:30 p.m.  I made an appointment for the hours of 8 a.m. - 12 p.m.  I waited and waited and at noon, called Comcast only to be told the rep (even when I asked him to read the appointment date and time back to me), put the wrong date down.  When I explained that I could not take time off from work and was not going to waste another day to get my Cable fixed.....I asked to speak to a supervisor as no one seemed to care or used the excuse there's nothing we can do about the mistake.  I asked to speak to a Supervisor and spoke to a woman named Daisy.  Daisy decided the way to placate me was to lie and tell me that my area had some problems and they were working on it.  Someone finally came out after 5:30 p.m. on a Thursday the following week and explained it was not a Cable problem but a problem with my TV. funny how my Cable worked the prior week.  He also grumbled that it was his last appointment and he did not appreciate having to come out so late.A few weeks later I went to watch Channel 1.  I've been a customer for well over 10 years with Comcast and when I called to find out why I did not have that channel anymore. I was told they did an audit and I was never entitled to it. I could upgrade to a Digital package for an additional $35 dollars.  Never in all these years have I received a letter telling me I was not entitled to that channel.  I see the commericals that Comcast has....I think they need to quit lying about the so called services they provide.  And with costs the way they are. I'm certainly not going to dish out another $35 dollars for something they never, ever told me I was not entitled to."
1,"After switching from Comcast to AT&T due to billing issues and poor customer service, my neighborhood went under heavy work from Comcast. While they were here, their technicians disconnected my AT&T data line and took the barrel connector so I could not reconnect it. A few other people on my street actually had their cables capped with physically locked terminators. I'm not sure how they get away with this, but from what i've been able to find online, this happens quite often."
1,I no longer receive services provided by Comcast and have made multiple attempts to return the equipment left in my home by THEIR TECHNICIAN. During each attempt I am told the equipment I have does not belong to Comcast however it is the equipment that was provided to me by their technician. Comcast has reported a significant dollar amount negatively on my credit report and refuses to accept the equipment THEIR TECHNICIAN left in my home. My overall credit rating has dropped with all three bureaus as a result of this action by Comcast.
1,"Called comcast to have service in new apartment.  They said I had to call back after the current tenant issued orders to disconnect.  Called back when this was done, Their computers were down.  Called back again and was told that I cannot call until the previous customers account is closed and all services are turned off.   I told them, I never heard of a company that could not make arrangements for the next tenant to move in and have services provided on their move-in date. Said sorry, cant take order til account is closed.  If Verizon Fios were available, I would go that route.  I will downgrade my services from Comcast when I am finally able to speak to someone about setting up service.  If you are moving into someplace on the first and the old tenant has service until the 31st, you cannot call until the first.  This is a hazard to anyone that requires emergency phone service.  It will not be available on your move-in day!  "
1,"   I had services for Cable through Comcast in March/April I then asked if they would include internet and phone services in March.  About one month later my computer was stolen so I asked that Comcast take out the services for the internet but I still wanted to keep the Cable and phone if they were to stay at the same monthly price.  It was no problem according to Comcast the rep indicated that they would just have to put in a code so I could keep the phone service at 19.99. The following month the bill was pretty high so again I called and again the rep said all was taken care of and the cable and phone services would be the same, the last rep just forgot to put in the correct code.  Come June we make a payment physically at the Visalia, CA location and they bill it to the wrong person.  My husband who was paying the bill asked to discuss the phone issue and they said he was not on the account so they could not give him any information.  We make another payment in June for $40.00 more to try and keep our account current.  In July I call the 1-800-comcast number the rep indicates that we are paying $44.plus for phone services and that I needed to go to the physical location and speak to a manager.  We live a rural area with a lot of farming and we have to go 20-25 miles to get to this location so it is a lot of effort when you are working as well. Beginning of August I go there and ask to speak to a manager, well the manager is away and cannot be contacted, so I give all the information that I have received since we installed Cable, phone and internet.  I asked that the manager to call me so I can get credit for services in which I should not have been paying for in the first place and to confirm that they credit my account for the time that paid to another customer (that was taken care of) I also included my husband to the account (in which I'm not sure that they really did).  I also told the rep that I should be paid up to date.  She said that she in order for me not to get my services turned off I would have to pay the balance.  I said why would I have to pay the balance if I am up to date with my payments, my agreement with Comcast was that they provide telephone services for 19.99 a month for a year. When I finally left after 1/2 hour of trying to get this straighten out the only thing she could tell me was that she would have the manager call me the next day.  Two weeks later, no phone call from the manager or messages. On Aug. 20th they turned off my services so again I call and spoke with the supervisor.  She said that in order to have the phone service at 19.99 it had to be a bundle with the internet and cable to get that rate, and the reason my bill was so high was because they bill one month in advance.  I informed her of everything the reps in the past had told me.  She said there was nothing she could do because my service was shut off.   I spoke to a manager that same day 2 hours later who also said there was nothing he could do.  He could not tell me why the previous reps were telling me my account was ok.  I told him if they had advised me of this in April that the phone service was at 44.plus I would have cancelled that service way back then.  This can not be Ethical Business Practice.  I have all the information from day one and they still want to charge me over 200 dollars to get my services turned back on.  I don't understand how a business can get away with this type of abuse.

1,"We made 2 check payments for our MI comcast account but have accidentally mailed it to their Seattle PO box, which is for CA accounts. the checks has a complete information in which account we are trying to pay, but they applied it to our Comcast CA account which is so stupid because it doesnt even match the amount of our CA Comcast bill. So I have to call MI comcast and told them about this, I even called CA comcast to have that payment taken out of our CA account, a supervisor told me she'll take care of it to be applied for our MI comcast account. But 4 weeks have passed and never this problem, I have called them every single day. They have disconnected the service, we have to pay by credit card, they charges disconnection fee, and they kept wasting my time for at least 30 mins to more than an hour every single day."
1, I would have never had taken 1/2 day off of work for this phone install nor would I have signed up for the triple play.  When I asked them to change me back to what I had they told me they could not.  Now I have a phone I don't want and also they falsely told me I was going to get a free Wii. I took 1/2 day off of work which really was turned out to be more then 1/2 day with all the additional phone calls. I now have a phone I do not want and cannot get my old modem back I had with Patriot Media.
1," When comcast called our home phone we told her ""how can we not be here, we just answered the phone?"" ( he came back after comcast told him we were in fact home.) We have also been calling asking about phone service. They keep advertising it in this area, even to get a free Wii if you sign up. When we try to sign up, they tell us it is not available in this area. So we can't get it, or the free Wii system. Isn't this false advertisment? I work in customer service and my company advertises something we cannot deliver on I still have to honor the advertisment in some way to compensate. Don't advertise something you can't deliver on. And fix the service we are already overpaying for. We continue to pay a high price for cable that we cannot watch because the ""tiling"" and audio is so bad. "
1,"We have been trying to transfer our Comcast service from our old address to our new home. We had an install appointment on Saturday, 8/16/08, from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. They didn't come. We called and were told the technician would call us but to call back in 1 hr. if we weren't contacted. When we called back in an hr., we were directed to call back during regular business hours.  Starting at 9 a.m. on Sunday, we called and were told our ticket had been escalated and to call back every hour until the technician arrived, which we did. (please keep in mind, we were also attempting to move) Everytime we called, we were put on terminal hold, transferred to dead lines, or someone's voicemail. We were told we had a 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. service appointment and to respect that appointment and quit calling but then told before hanging up to continue calling every hour.  We were told they had attempted to come on Saturday but we were here. I was here all day Saturday. We were told they never came Saturday. We were told we already had service at the new address and did we want to cancel it. The call center is in Mexico City, several times they transferred us to a Houston, Tx call center but on other calls, we were told they could not transfer us. We were not allowed to speak to supervisors. We were told they were too busy or that they couldn't help us but would not speak to us. Once, the person I was speaking to put me on hold and came back and said he was the supervisor, that he had no supervisor, that he had no one who supervised his work or that he reported to and that he could not help us in anyway. Then I was told that we never had an installment appointment, as it was Sunday and that I should call back on Monday. We were told several times that someone would be calling us, no one ever did. Comcast charges for installation so we were paying to be abused. Finally, late Sunday night, a very nice man came and attempted to install service. Our internet is up (Thank God, as my husband's job requires he have home internet service at all times...he is on call) but our cable television is barely functional. We brought our old cable converter box to trade for a dvr/high def box. The installer didn't have the box we had ordered days previously. Instead of the channel package we had before/and were supposed to continue to have, we have part of basic cable. And we have yet another appointment to continue the install...on Tuesday. Does this mean the weekend's nightmare is unending?  My suggestion to everyone is: if you have any other choice for internet/cable service, do NOT use Comcast. My husband took time from work to move, instead of moving, he stayed on the phone with Comcast and I stayed at the new address waiting for installation. I have not recieved the bill yet but Comcast charges for installation so I don't know yet how much we will pay to be so abused."
1,"I am a very dissatisfied Comcast cable customer. I have recently discovered that for the past two years Comcast has been charging me for services that I have not been receiving. Every month, I have paid for an extra digital box when I have never had more than one box. I never requested this service and have recently found out from a helpful Comcast representative, Jarell Jones, that a technician made this error after making a routine repair. He never recorded that the non-working box was removed from my home. Subsequently, I have been charged $20.00-$23.00 a month for the past 24 months.   Obviously, I would like a refund for the months that I was charged in error by Comcast. However, when I spoke with a Comcast supervisor, he informed me that Comcast has a policy of only crediting customers back 6 months. I do not understand how this can be legal. How can Comcast take money from me for something that I never received? I was charged as result of Comcast's error, and I believe that Comcast should do the right thing and refund me all of the money that I paid for a service that I never received.  If you can help me with this situation, I would greatly appreciate it. I paid $480.00 over two years and Comcast is offering to reimburse me $149.00 for only 6 months of that time. Can this be legal? I don't see any statement of a 6 month reimbursement policy on the billing statement. Is there anything I can do?"
1,I'm getting ripped off on Comcast broadband service. I have the evidence to prove this fraud. Paying for service I'm not getting!
1,"I signed a two year agreement and was to receive a $300 gift check within 6-8 weeks.  I've mad numerous phone calls to unhelpful and rude service reps who told me to stop calling because I was not going to receive my check.  The original service rep who placed my order did it incorrectly and although my record shows I'm eligible, I have not received my promotional offer. I wonder how many other comsumers were scammed. I would never have signed the agreement and to terminate would cost additional money in loss.  I was counting on the gift card for gas and possibly to pay my comcast bill."
1," Our service in the area of Mandarin has become unacceptable.  Over the past several months, our outages have increased to near daily.  The internet service has become increasingly slower.   Recently, we were without telephone service for five (5) days due the inability of Comcast to provide a service technician.    Comcast, by our selection, provides our telephone, internet, and cable television service.  We, without fail, pay our monthly service charges of over $194.  However, we continue to have these problems.  Upon calling the service department and getting routed through your telephone tree to the correct department, they have no answers other than there is an outage in Mandarin.  Finally, today, after I was quite abrupt with one of your customer service representatives; I was told that the service department has known of the problems on Node 21 in Mandarin, but it is working by the time the technician arrives.   I have asked on countless occasions to speak to someone other than the customer service representative that answers the telephone.  But, I am told consistently that there is no one else available.  I am informed that my concern will be e-mailed--but there is no guarantee that my call will be returned or that I will be contact.  Indeed they were correct--I have not been contacted by anyone in Comcast management. Consequently, since no one has ever called to discuss this problem further, I am filing a complaint with not only the Better Business Bureau, but also with the State of Florida Insurance Commission and with the Federal Trade Commission.  I feel confidently that you will find time to respond to their investigations. As I have been for the past several months, I welcome any communications with Comcast management.

1,"      I was given an offer from a Mr. K.(215-) back in the 2006 (not sure of the month, tried to forget all the problems I had) He had promise me that it wouldn't go pass $50.00 because I made it clear I was on a budget.  Well to find out that two weeks after optaining service my first bill came of $700.00 and plus dollars I immeriately call Mr. K. and he told me it was an error. Well the error kept araising in within two  weeks my bill had pass a thousand dollars. I kept calling Comcast and complainting, they send out a technistions and to some point took one of my supposely pre-program box,  (Pre-program box, what is that all about).  The real that mad me upset was the movies suppousely rented or download were *****S movies as if I was a freak, my 16 year old daughter or my niece. Now after almost two years, I finally wanted to know what had happened with the issue. I go in contact with the Corporate just to find out that Corporate will give me another adjustment for $900.00 and plus dollars, becasue they realized that SOME of the movies were actually order without the control as they said.  Now if they found this out, how can you confirm that the other movies were order by us. This is to complicated, I can not understand how this can happen.  I heard of another complaint with this same issue.  I beleive that the only balance I have with Comcast is about $48.00, becasue yes after the complainting and calling I stop paying my bill and that was the last one bill, before I told them to come and cut it off.   I need to know what should I do about this matter. Thank you very much Consequences were; I was hang-up by employees at Comcast, the waiting for the technition to appear and find out what was going on and in many times did not even show-up. This took time from my job since I was waiting for them. Physical damage had plenty of headaches, stomach pains and plenty of crying. I could not stop wondering how this could've happened to me. I am a 48 year old woman and yet have not went to a strip club or even seen a ***** movie in my whole life.  This makes my self-esteem to feel very low. Just the other day when I received the call from Deidra, stating that some movies would be credit but not all. I was walking home from work speaking to her on my cell phone and that gave me a rush to my brains that I had to go home and get under the shower with cold water becasue once again my head started to wonder. This is not fair to me and who ever is going throw the same experience as I am. Please let me know what you think about this matter as soon as you can. thank you very much.

1,"our internet service was cut off due to too much bandwith usage, thier words not mine. called to complain and no one could let us know how much usage we have used or how much bandwith usage is left for the month. or why our service was cut even though the comcast bill is paid promptly every month.  why is this legal?  if comcast can't keep up with it's customers needs then they should stop advertising services they do not offer, such as unlimited internet connection (false advertising and neglecting to give goods or service when the other party has paid a premium for something is still called theft, graft, false advertising, and fraud. i'm sure i'm not the only one with this issue. class action anyone?stress, time and effort lost toward finding a remedy to my situation. and feeling like i was swindled by an advertising job. what's that worth to any one of you?"
1,"   I am a former customer of Comcast as I am appalled by the very poor customer service that Comcast has rendered to me as a customer. I moved to my current location on July 4, 2008. Two weeks prior to moving I contacted Comcast to order the Triple Play Package and to transfer service to my current location. I figured that since I had no problems with my cable before and after Comcast acquired my previous cable company, I would have no problems with the Triple Play. To my surprise, I was wrong.  My call to Comcast was answered by a representative by the name of Ms. Harris. I told Ms. Harris that I wanted to place the order to transfer my existing cable service, transfer my existing telephone number from AT&T to Comcast, add internet service, and add two additional DVR's for my new place.  I was told that my service would be set up for the new location and told I would get the Triple Play Package for $99/month. A technician would come out on Saturday, July 5th to set up the new service. A week later after my first call, I called Comcast to confirm my order and to try to change the service date to Wednesday, July 2, 2008.  When I spoke to the representative, I was told that there was no order for me to get the Triple Play Package or for the DVR's. I had to go through the entire process again. My reason for trying the triple play package was for the bundle and for the six month introductory price.  The technician arrived on July 5th and within the two-hour time frame to install the new service. He set up the modem, the phone line, and the cable and things were working fine. I asked him about the extra DVR boxes and he stated that the extra boxes were not on his order. I never got the additional boxes because I could never get my major issue resolved. Since I don't work for Comcast, I don't know the procedures for having a telephone line switched from one provider to the next. I didn't know that my number with AT&T wasn't transferred over until I received calls on my cell phone telling me that people couldn't reach me.  On Monday, July 7, 2008, 888.611.4466 I called regarding the wrong number being issued and was told that I should've been told that I needed to put in a port request to transfer my number. I told the representative that I was not notified of that when I called to make my request. The representative told me that ""she was sorry"" and that she would put in the request in for me and that I would need to speak with an automated system to verify that I wanted to port my number over. A technician was scheduled to come out on Saturday, July 12th to transfer the number over. The representative also stated that it would take six business days for the number to be ported. I informed the representative that my old number was still at the location that I moved from and that I didn't want an active line at that location for six days. She informed me that I needed to keep the line open in order to port the number over. Never once did she state to me that I needed to have my line at my current location that I wanted to port the number over to. On Wednesday, July 9, 2008 I called Comcast again regarding the number, to make sure that the port request had gone through, and to also comment on the hassles that I had to endure thus far. During my 2+ hour ordeal, I was transferred incorrectly, disconnected when I should have been placed on hold, and transferred to manager's voicemails when I requested to speak with them. Finally, when I told a representative that the next time I called, I would disconnect my service, I was transferred to a live manager by the name of Cynthia P. Cynthia was very helpful and apologetic for the type of services that I received. She stated that she would help to get my problem resolved. Cynthia informed me that the technician would be at my place on the 12th and had given me a number and extension to contact her if I had any other questions. After Cynthia spoke with the technicians, she called me back to let me know that I needed to have AT&T to transfer my number to the new location and that it would need to be done before the 12th. Thinking that I was finally getting the help that I needed, I call AT&T to let them know that I wanted to transfer my service and they did so on the 11th.  On the 12th the technician arrived. It was a waste of time for him because the number was not ported over. The technician stated that the port would probably be completed by Tuesday, July 15th. I waited and July 15th came and went. No phone number ported over. I waited until August 4th  to call back thinking that things would need to take some time and to try to convince myself not to disconnect my services from Comcast. When I called I asked to speak with a supervisor and was given a supervisor named, Adam.  For the 10th time, I had to tell my story of what was actually wrong with my service. I informed Adam that I had a number, 954-****, that was given to me by Comcast. Adam argued with me and told me that Comcast couldn't have given me that number and that the number should have been the number that I wanted to port over. I told Adam that both the 954 number and my old number were at my current location. After many back and forth discussions, Adam finally placed me on hold for about 20 minutes so that he could figure out the problem. After coming back on the line, Adam stated that the port request to transfer my number was never put in. By this time I was furious. I informed Adam that I had placed the request and that I already waiting to have the number ported over. Adam informed me that I would need to put in another request and wait the additional six business days to have the number transferred. He put in an order for a technician to come out on August 8th.  I got off the phone with Adam feeling disgusted with Comcast.  Before and after calling the 1-800-Comcast, I made repeated calls to Cynthia P. because I knew that she knew my situation. I didn't want to constantly explain the same situation. Cynthia rarely answered her telephone. When I spoke with Adam I informed him of my bill. I told him that I signed up for the triple play for $99/month. Adam stated that the promotional amount was only for new customers. I informed him that I knew of friends who were not new customers who had the Triple Play for that amount and also that it was the reason I signed up for it. Adam then referred me to the retention department. The young man in this department was helpful in providing credit for the triple play for the previous month, but did not change the amount that I was paying to $99/month.  After the technician came out on the 8th, he found that there was nothing he could do. AT&T did not give permission to port the number over. He stated that another technician would need to come out on the 13th. During this entire time, representatives from Comcast called the number that I wanted to port over to verify that a technician would be out. Cynthia P. called the number as well. Many times I informed Comcast representatives that the number to be ported was not working and that the 954 was the number that was working. I see that no one decided to take that into account or even place those key issues it in my account notes. Actually I had to find out that the technician would not be out on the 13th through a voicemail on the line that was to be ported. This all bring me to the day that I disconnected my service. Upon awakening on August 14, 2008 I found that my 954 was not working. I called Comcast and was told that there was a line issue and was disconnected after speaking with the first representative. I called back and stated that I wanted to disconnect my service. I had to speak with four different representatives before that could be done. For each representative I had to explain the situation. I finally told the last representative that I wanted to disconnect the service because it didn't work. She put in an order for a technician to come out on the 18th. I have had to pay a phone bill for AT&T for two additional months while waiting on Comcast to help me out. For the 10th time, I had to tell my story of what was actually wrong with my service. I informed Adam that I had a number, 954-****, that was given to me by Comcast.

I got off the phone with Adam feeling disgusted with Comcast.  Before and after calling the 1-800-Comcast, I made repeated calls to Cynthia P. because I knew that she knew my situation. I didn't want to constantly explain the same situation. Cynthia rarely answered her telephone. When I spoke with Adam I informed him of my bill. I told him that I signed up for the triple play for $99/month. Adam stated that the promotional amount was only for new customers.

1," I have sinced called 4 other times with no conclusion at all. I finally did receive a credit from Mary (employee # 24464) for 1 of the HDTV boxes which she was able to see I never had. But that is it. They still will not take off the 1 HDTV box and the HDTV service, they also mentioned that if I want them to come pick up this box they will charge me. This is very frustrating. I only ordered triple play for 99.00 so this is all I should be responsible for and I should not have to pay for them to come pick up this HDTV box and give me the box they were originally suppsoe to give me anyway. (HELP) As of today I have been overchargd approximately 70.00 each month for the past 4 months"
1,"I'm a wife of an employee of Comcast who has given them almost 11 years of dedicated service. He is now on doctors care stress leave. Comcast has treated thier employees like dirt they do offer Christmas parties which the Employee has to pay for, the do not care if you work 20 hors a day, they stoped any pay raises, they hired a manager for thier Roseville office whom tells the Employees if they don't like thier job or something the company hjas done then find another [expletive]Job not to professional. My husband is getting phone calls telling him if he does not come back to work then his job is not secure WHILE ON DOCTORS STRESS LEAVE. COMCAST CARES ABOUT 1 THING AND THAT IS MONEY NOT THE EMPLOYEE NOR THE CUSTOMER. "
1,"I have called Comcast several times to report that they are blacklisting a newsletter I used to receive every day.  Each time, I was told they would unblock it, but that it would only last 24 hours.    I have also written the company which sends out the newsletter and they wrote me that Comcast is still blocking them, even after they have supposedly complied with Comcast's requirements.  They have suggested I use another server to receive their e-mails as nothing they do has worked.  Lastly, the person in the secrutiy dept. has told me I may not call again...No real damage.  But I miss out on medical information, special health offers.  And I am no longer allowed to complain."
1,"      I originally signed up with Adelphia Cable in 2002 for digital cable service.  The service was great!  No problems with reception or customer service.  About two years ago Comcast Cable Company bought out Adelphia.  It was a smooth transition or so I thought.  I admit there have been times over the past several years when my service was disconnected due to non payment.  (I lost my job and was struggling financially but was doing my best to stay afloat....)  I would get my bill caught up and get my services reconnected and pay the $30.00 reconnect fee with no complaints.  My service for digital cable initially started out being approximately $50.00 a month.  Over time they did increase but not drastically. Once Comcast took over I had my services reconnected again and began paying my bill on time and had continued service.  Once again hard times hit and I had to let the cable service go.  I called and spoke with a customer service representative and told them that I intended on having the service turned back on in about a month and if I really needed to turn in all the equipment or if I should just hang on to it since I was going to get my services reconnected.  I was told to just hang onto it since my plans were to continue service.  So that is what I did.  Literally about two weeks later I received a notice from a collection agency saying that I owed almost $500.00 for unreturned equipment for Comcast. I called Comcast again and spoke to another CSR and told them about the previous conversation and about the collection notice and I was told to disregard the collection notice especially since I was also arranging to get my bill paid and services turned back on.  The CSR told me that she was starting a ticket and that their representatives would contact the collection agency and let them know that  the issue had been resolved.  Again, I received another collection notice about unreturned equipment....even though at this point I was PAYING to rent the equipment! Again I called Comcast....again I was told that it would be taken care of.  I did not receive another notice after that so I assumed that it had indeed been dealt with. In the meantime I receive a bill from Comcast for almost $200 even though when I had my services reinstated I paid almost $200 for past due bill plus one month services plus the wonderful reconnect fee.  I contacted Comcast again to dispute my bill and the CSR told me that I was over charged at the local office and he was issuing a credit to my bill and would not have another bill due for a couple of months.  I was ecstatic! One less bill to worry about for a short while.  Instead I receive another bill the following month for the  PAST DUE balance of $200 plus another months worth of service.   Again, I called Comcast and spoke with a CSR.  Again I was told that the bill would be adjusted and that I would only have a partial amount due the following month.  I was also told that there were some issues when the Adelphia billing system was imported in the Comcast billing system and that was probably the issue.   So, we moved, and along with us came our Comcast cable.  Plus we added internet service.  The Comcast technician came right over when he was supposed to be here and got us all set up.  No problems.  Two months go by in the new place with no bill.  So I am thinking, ok, we still have a credit on the bill from the past screw ups.  (Also, I am working two jobs and quite frankly thought that when I do owe them money they will send me a bill because they will want to collect that money!) So another month goes by and still no bill and so I decide to go online and try to pull up my bill online since I thought it would be simpler to look there instead of calling and holding.  And guess what?  The internet is down.  So I call Comcast and get a technician on the line who says oh your service has been turned off due to non payment.  I explained to him about the credit and that the cable on the tv was still working.  He says he will have to transfer me to someone else about the bill but that the tv should be turned off any minute because they generally turn off all services at the same time.    So I get transferred.  This woman proceeds to tell me that I owe over $400 in past due bills.  I tell her that I have not received a bill and that I had been issued a credit etc.  She says she does not know why I am not getting a bill but my services can not be reactivated until the balance is paid off.  She also says that she will check into the bill issue.   Low and behold I receive a bill within a couple of weeks.  So I start paying on it (mind you the cable tv was never disconnected!)but do not get it paid in full and I get another bill.  I am still being billed for internet service that I am not receiving.  Again, I call.  I am told that their system shows that I still have internet services.  I explain that I called a month earlier and a technician told me that my services were disconnected due to non payment.  The CSR then tells me that I should go to my local office and discuss it further with those people.   I head over to the local office and tell them the whole story from the very beginning about the credits, not receiving a bill, collection notices, and not having internet services.  I also explain that my cable tv services were never turned off and that I do not expect that to be removed from my bill but I do not think I should be billed for a service that I have not received.  I am told that it will be discussed with their supervisor, who ironically is in a meeting, and that they will get back to me.  Get back to me they most certainly did....I was told that their system does not show that my services were disconnected and they can not find a log file anywhere from the technician saying that I ever called in the first place.  They recommended I call back to the 800 number and discuss it further with them.  Stupid me, I thought that since I  had been a customer for so long that it would make a difference.   So another month goes by, and another bill comes in, and another charge for internet service that I was told was disconnected due to non payment.  Again, I call.  (No one can say that I did not give Comcast every loyalty and chance to make it right.) Again, I am told that their system does not show my services as being disconnected.  Another call to tech support saying that my services were terminated due to non payment.  So I sucked it up and paid the entire bill including the internet charges that were not used.  Once the bill was paid I called tech support again and had a rather nice fellow on the phone that went through all the settings, we rebooted, we did everything he could think of.  Finally he says oh I bet it is your network card.  You should run down to the local store and buy a new one and call us back.   So I went and bought a new card and low and behold that was it.  Voila, internet service.  So what I am trying to figure out is through all these calls why did not one person before him say maybe its your computer.  Maybe you should check your equipment.  Not once was this said until that guy.  So I call customer service again and explain the whole situation again to them thinking that maybe they would want to work with me since their tech support would not even look into the situation.  Nope.  Nothing. So I sucked it up and keep on going.   So, now that I have internet service with them I check my credit report on line.  Guess what?  There is the collection agency on my credit report saying that I have an unpaid bill for $400 plus for Comcast due to unreturned equipment.  It took another 6 weeks to get that disputed and taken care of.   Six months later I loose my job again (the business closed) and I am struggling to pays bills again.  I called a CSR to try and get my services reduced to save money where I could.  She set me up on a sweet promotion they had going with internet and cable tv services for under $100.  I was very pleased.  A month goes by and I get a bill.  $400 plus!  Supposedly for past due balances.  Now every month I have gone over to the local office and asked what I needed to pay and was told and wrote them out a check and paid it.  And now somehow for two months of services my bill is over $400 again?  I called the 800 number AGAIN and attempted to discuss my bill.  I am told that since my services have now been disconnected due to non payment I am no longer eligible for any promotions and my services will run over $150 a month before taxes and all the other bogus charges.  I say to the lady on the phone, because now I am at my wits end with Comcast, so I guess what you are telling me is I need to find someone else to get tv and internet services from because apparently Comcast does not want it.  All she said was ""hmm"".  And that was that.  I thanked her for her time as was actually nice.  And hung up.   We are switching to Embarq and are getting tv, phone and internet services at a great rate.  Hopefully our experience with them will be a more positive one. I feel certain that I am out of hundreds of dollars due to Comcast errors somewhere. The stress of worrying what is going to happen next with my bill, are my services going to work today, and am I gonna be charged for something that I do not have has been ridiculous. I feel that for a company that is so massive there should be some accommodations made. It is a horrible analogy but I feel like the battered wife that finally left her husband. Bruised but free!      Again, I called Comcast and spoke with a CSR.  Again I was told that the bill would be adjusted and that I would only have a partial amount due the following month.  I was also told that there were some issues when the Adelphia billing system was imported in the Comcast billing system and that was probably the issue.

Get back to me they most certainly did....I was told that their system does not show that my services were disconnected and they can not find a log file anywhere from the technician saying that I ever called in the first place.  They recommended I call back to the 800 number and discuss it further with them.  Stupid me, I thought that since I  had been a customer for so long that it would make a difference.   So another month goes by, and another bill comes in, and another charge for internet service that I was told was disconnected due to non payment.  Again, I call.  (No one can say that I did not give Comcast every loyalty and chance to make it right.) Again, I am told that their system does not show my services as being disconnected.  Another call to tech support saying that my services were terminated due to non payment.  So I sucked it up and paid the entire bill including the internet charges that were not used.  Once the bill was paid I called tech support again and had a rather nice fellow on the phone that went through all the settings, we rebooted, we did everything he could think of.  Finally he says oh I bet it is your network card.  You should run down to the local store and buy a new one and call us back.   So I went and bought a new card and low and behold that was it.  Voila, internet service.  So what I am trying to figure out is through all these calls why did not one person before him say maybe its your computer.  Maybe you should check your equipment.  Not once was this said until that guy.  So I call customer service again and explain the whole situation again to them thinking that maybe they would want to work with me since their tech support would not even look into the situation.  Nope.  Nothing. So I sucked it up and keep on going.   So, now that I have internet service with them I check my credit report on line.  Guess what?  There is the collection agency on my credit report saying that I have an unpaid bill for $400 plus for Comcast due to unreturned equipment.  It took another 6 weeks to get that disputed and taken care of.   Six months later I loose my job again (the business closed) and I am struggling to pays bills again.  I called a CSR to try and get my services reduced to save money where I could.  She set me up on a sweet promotion they had going with internet and cable tv services for under $100.  I was very pleased.  A month goes by and I get a bill.  $400 plus!  Supposedly for past due balances.  Now every month I have gone over to the local office and asked what I needed to pay and was told and wrote them out a check and paid it.  And now somehow for two months of services my bill is over $400 again?  I called the 800 number AGAIN and attempted to discuss my bill.  I am told that since my services have now been disconnected due to non payment I am no longer eligible for any promotions and my services will run over $150 a month before taxes and all the other bogus charges.  I say to the lady on the phone, because now I am at my wits end with Comcast, so I guess what you are telling me is I need to find someone else to get tv and internet services from because apparently Comcast does not want it.  All she said was ""hmm"".  And that was that.  I thanked her for her time as was actually nice.  And hung up.   We are switching to Embarq and are getting tv, phone and internet services at a great rate.  Hopefully our experience with them will be a more positive one. I feel certain that I am out of hundreds of dollars due to Comcast errors somewhere. The stress of worrying what is going to happen next with my bill, are my services going to work today, and am I gonna be charged for something that I do not have has been ridiculous. I feel that for a company that is so massive there should be some accommodations made. It is a horrible analogy but I feel like the battered wife that finally left her husband. Bruised but free!     So I went and bought a new card and low and behold that was it.  Voila, internet service.

1,There is not a week that goes by that using Comcast for internet connection is so slow that you cannot use it or you do not wish to spend all day trying to download something. There Cable TV is not much better. I have had satelite TV where rain distorts the picture and Comcast has the same thing or the service will go out for no reason with no explanation of why when it comes back on.I use the internet in my business and I can't afford the slow speed's that Comcast provides.
1,"I want to share with you how FED UP my husband and I with Comcast service. Now that my husband and I are moving to a new home, we will NOT continue with Comcast, PERIOD! The service is TERRIBLE not only the signal but CUSTOMER SERVICE is WORTHLESS! If you call the 1800 they are ALWAYS on a heavy call waiting and suggest you to call at a later time, SOCKERS you DO NOT treat a customer that way, you prompt the customer to a friendly, SMILE customer representative ASAP.  If you visit the OAK RIDGE BRANCH they are a DISSASTER WALKING. I don't know why they bother to change from location to a ""better building"" if now I have a LOOOOOOONG waiting on a line than I did ever before at their old branch. Not matter what time of the day you visit comcast at OAK RIDGE BRANCH your waiting is more than half an hour, RIDICULOUS! Some customers are during their work lunch time and I saw customer walking out upset, can't blame them! When you FINALLY get to the counter to be helped, you wonder....where is the SMILES on their faces, where is their customer service training that ""they suppose to have"" when they get hired, INBILIEVABLE! Instead of directing to you as ""Good Morning, how may I help you?"" with laziness they say ""What can I do for you?"" NEVER SMILE, WORTHLESS EMPLOYEES! AT OAK RIDGE BRANCH.  I remember that once before, I called because I use to have the box and I was watching a movie and it froozed, I call the 1800 number and all I got out of that phone call after having to wait for a long time on the line was: ""Well! The on-demand is free to you!"" Kind of like ""hey! why are you complaining."" I ask to speak to management about this STUPID NON-SENSE response on counterpart of the customer service representative and all I got was the same response ""Well, the on-demand is free to you."" I don't care if it's free, you are providing me with that service, FREE OR NOT, I'm calling in for help, I expect you to help me not to get that kind of senseless and IGNORANT response!  I AM FEED UP WITH COMCAST and I am GLAD that IT'S MY PLEASURE TO ANNOUNCE TO ALL OF YOU THAT MY HUSBAND AND I ARE LETTING GO OF THIS SERVICE ALTOGETHER, YES! FINALLY! We will look forward to another service provider, one that I can be treated with respect and dignity, one that when I call the 1800 I can find answers, one that when I visit the office in person I find people who REALLY WANT TO WORK, who really want to be there and not people who are just holding a job because they have to pay another bill, like the folks at OAK RIDGE BRANCH. Once before, my husband and I, had connect internet, cable and telephone with comcast, well! PUBLIC GUESS WHAT? A week later we were not be able to make use of ANYTHING and when I called the 1800 they told me that the very first time available they have were almost a week from that day, A WEEK without telephone, internet and cable, IMAGINE! IMAGINE HOW FRUSTRATING THAT FELT! I probably have had more people from comcast visiting my home in a year than family and friends, altogether. I wish that customers do realize how a headache implicates to be a comcast's customer and LET GO! LET GO OF THAT SERVICES that after all, all it's is EXPENSIVE AND WORTHLESS!  Again, I AM SO GLAD TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE LEAVE COMCAST UPON MOVING TO OUR NEW HOME! I prefer to threw my money to the trash count than to keep waisting it with COMCAST!  Again, I AM SO GLAD TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE LEAVE COMCAST UPON MOVING TO OUR NEW HOME! I prefer to threw my money to the trash count than to keep waisting it with COMCAST! "
1,"We always paid our cable bill by going to the cable office. Now Comcast informed us that we have to pay $3.99 when we pay in person. What's going on with thes business' that they need another $3.99. This is a rip-off to the consumers and Should be stopped. It's hard enough coming up with the normal payment. Seems like every one is getting greedy. People like us on a limited income has it hard enough to pay for anything. Please, somebody, put a halt on all these business' who want more and more of our limited income!Because we pay in person and always on time, the extra money Comcast is wanting can cut into our medication funds. It has put my wife in a great depression and talking about going to Direct TV, but then we wouldn't have the local networks and we couldn't keep track of the weather in bad storms/"
1,"About a year ago Time-Warner transferred it's cable (Internet) franchise to Comcast in the Houston area. At that time we (subscribers) were given to believe that the transfer would NOT affect current service contracts. I had Road-Runner Lite (a lower speed broadband connection at a lower cost) at the time. Comcast continued to bill for this service without change until recently. Now they've bumped my bill significantly. When I queried Comcast they maintain that I was on a six month promotional service which was now converting to regular service. This is a lie (Comcast has been providing, and billing, for service for ONE YEAR under the original Road Runner Lite service contract). I have had NO COMMUNICATION from Comcast during the past year to indicate that there has or would be any change in my service agreement (to the contrary, as I indicated, when the service was changed over we had assurances of NO CHANGES to the service). Comcast has arbitrarily, capriciously, spuriously, maliciously and WITHOUT any notice whatsoever to subscribers decided to change the terms of service to it's customers. Comcast has a TOTAL MONOPOLY in this part of the State of Texas for Cable service (some parts of Houston have alternatives, we do not). This completely unconscionable. Cost of service has increased 20% WITHOUT any warning or advanced notice."
1,"I have filled out a complaint via the BBB.  The  BBB ticket has been open 12 days without any corrective action from Comcast. The issue is the web space management at the Comcast Company. I have had over 40 calls in regarding this single issue. Several phone  calls have been over 2 hours in length. Nothing is being done about  this issue. Every time I open a help desk ticket (by calling in); the tickets are  closed without the issue being resolved. I have called every single day  for 2 weeks in an attempt to get this remedied. I have been told that I  am well overdue for a refund, but it is the Comcast company policy  that nothing is to be refunded/credited until the issue is resolved.  It has been over a year, and I have yet to get a refund/credit for the  web space issue. This issue still needs to be taken care of.  I feel the company is not keeping their promise as stated in their  terms and conditions. I have never gotten to talk to a Tier 3 technical support. Each time  the ticket is entered, and elevated to the tier 3 tech support, the  ticket is closed without being worked. I called again today (30July08) to  see the status of the latest trouble ticket. Much to my horror, I was  told it was resolved. In reality, the issue has not been resolve, it has  not been worked, it has not been fixed..  I am seeking resolution to the problem, as well as a refund/credit for  the money I have spent for this service I have yet to receive.   Settlement Sought:  Refund/Credit for the money/time spent without  service. Service made available as per the Comcast company service  agreements to customrs.Money has been wasted on a product/service that has yet to be properly provided. money has been spent on this product/service for over a year.Currently, i do not see a rebate in the process. Damage: money spent on a product/service that has not been properly provided."
1,"This is by for the worst costumer service that I have ever received from any company. My ordeal began on Tuesday 08/05/2008. Upon arriving home from work that evening I discovered that my Cable, Internet and Telephone Service was not working, all provided by Comcast. I did not call immediately because I knew there was a storm earlier which may have caused the problem. The next day The problem still existed. I called Comcast off and on all day, only to be put on hold and disconnected time after time. The last time that day I held on for 30 minutes only to receive a busy signal. The next Morning I started up again around 7am. By 8am I finally spoke to some one. He looked into the problem and told me that since my services had been off for two days, he would escalate the ticket and someone would be out that day. I waited all day long and no one arrived. That evening I called back and the representative stated that I did not have an appointment that day. She stated that my appointment was for the next day between 10am and 1pm. I work from 10am to 630pm, there is no way I would have made that appointment. He assured me that someone would be at my home the next morning (Friday) before 9am but definitely between 10 and 1. After rearranging my work schedule I waited until 2 pm, no call no show. The gentleman I spoke to stated that he would look into it and call me back. I gave him my cell phone number, but I never received a call. The next young lady that I spoke to stated that she assure me that someone would be out after 7pm Saturday, after I got off work, no one showed. I received a call stating that no one was available and that my original appointment for Tuesday Aug, 12th between 10am and 1pm would have to stand. This is the first Im hearing of that appointment. This was the last straw; I canceled my internet and phone services and will switch to AT&T.  All of the conversations were conducted on my cell phone, some which lasted over 45minutes. My Cell bill is going to sky rocket. Im not foolish enough to believe that I will be compensated for that. I just want my final bill to reflect the time that I went without service and the stress, inconvenience and awful awful service that I had to endure. I will not recommend Comcast to anyone."
1,"About 14 months ago a Comcast technician installed high speed internet Service using a Netger router (purchased by me at the technician direction).  When I lost the connection and after waiting a week for a service appt., the tech. said he couldn't or wouldn't service it because it wasn't their product even though Comcast told me to get this and they intalled it.  HELP, HELP.no internet hook up."
1,"I was just informed that if your service with Comcast (at least here in Auburn, WA) was interrupted, YOU have to call CONcast and request your account be credited for the interruptions.Well, I called, and told them I wanted credit for interruptions, and over a period of about 2 years, I was credited $246.57!!!  They are now checking the rest of my service period, another 2 years.It seems to be that they should automatically credit your account, ever other utility I have ever had, has ALWAYS credited my accounts for service interruptions.  I personally think this is just Comcast being dishonest, hoping people will not find out about this policy, and not check their bills for the credits.Call Comcast people, and have them credit your account if you have EVER had ANY serivce interruptions.   They need to step up, and make things right, and I hope it costs them a pretty penny."
1,"Service range typ mid month to mid month. Example. Billed from 6/13/08 to 7/12/08, paid on 6/30/08. there is now specific ""Due Date"" is says ""on Recpt"". does the above sample make be ""late""? I have paid my bill electronically via my bank for a long long time on the typ. end of month date as shown above."
1,"After hours spent trying to get a live person on the phone, I finally arranged for an installation between 6-9 pm.  After waitng 3 1/2 hours in my empty house, no one shows.  I leave, but get a call from a technition at 9:50 telling me he's m sorry.  Next day I call to reschedule, all my information has been erased at Comcast.  they claim my appt. for the previous day was cancelled.  I have to issue a whole new order and wait another week for installation, and take moer time off from work.  I have yet to receive installation."
1,"I had an appointment scheduled for today from 1-5 pm. At 6pm, nobody had called or shown up. i called comcast and they said the tech was running late but would be there.  He finally arrived at 7 and said he could not do anything because the server was out. I sould have appreciated a phone call since I had to miss work and an appointment for seven that evening only to be told to reschedule. Of course when I called, it will be another week for my new services to change and I have to take more time off of work. When I called to complain and reschedule, the customer service man was almost yelling at me when I told him what happened. I asked for the supervisor and was offerd a $20 credit. Does that make up for my lost wages? I think not.One half day of missed wages and an imporant function and 1 hour ont he phone."
1,"Approx 3-1/2 wks ago I agreed to subscribe to Comcast 3 package deal, transferring my phone service from Vonage (which I have no complaints) to Comcast.  The original service date was set for 2 weeks because Comcast needed the time to order the transfer of the phone number from Vonage; referred to as porting)  About 5 days before the scheduled date I receive a call from Comcast asking to reschedule the appointment because Vonage has not released the number yet.  Appt is resch for over a week later.  Yesterday the tech shows up and makes all the equipment changes to install the phone service.  He than calls in his order and finds out that the phone number being transferred has still not been ported from Vonage.  He calls his Supervisor, who makes some phone calls and finds out that Vonage will not be releasing my phone number to Comcast for 18 business hours.  He has already disconnected the Vonage modem and the phone is currently active making calls through Comcast.  My Vonage account had been previously set up to forward incoming calls to my cell phone.  I was assured this would continue to work until the line was ported to Comcast, and at that time I would have full service with Comcast.  I would have to absorb my incoming calls on my cell minutes for the next 3 days.  I am not happy about this but have little choice at this time.  TODAY, the following moring, I find out that my Clients are calling my home number and receiving a Disconnected message!  I call Comcast; sit on hold for over 26 minutes waiting for a representative to answer.  She has no idea what the problem is and transfers me to CAG.  Angie in CAG states that the records show the service won't be transferred from Vonage till tomorrow and she can't do anything about it.  I asked her why my phone has been disconnected and she suggested that the problem might be with Vonage.  I called Vonage, they did not disconnect my number, it is still active.  Infact, he called him phone and it forwarded to my cell phone as previously programmed.  For some reason all local calls are not going through and getting a Disconnected message.    I had asked Angie for her supervisor's name; whom she said was not in the office today.  I asked for her supervisor's supervisor; whom she indicated was in a meeting.  I ended the call by letting her know that I was more than unhappy and would continue trying to make contact with someone that knew what was going on and could fix it.  I run my business through my home office and this was unacceptable.Lost business calls all morning.  Ironically, after enough calls and persistence I received a call back from Angie stating that my service was now active.  It took over 6 hours on the phone!"
1,"Comcast is fleecing us. Check out the paid programming in off tv broadcast slots. They charge us to subscribe and they charge to advertise. Plus, they run their commercials 3 at a time. Their commercials for the program are foolish, condecending and are geared to the mind of a 10 year old.  "
1,"I recently converted to digital cable with Comcast Cable. I had to rent a digital cable Box. I asked Comcast is it legal for a customer to own there own cable box? I was told YES. I purchased a digital cable box. Motorola DCT700. This the same type of cable box I'm leasing from the cable co. I phoned the cable co to activate this box, gave them the serail No. and now they refuse to activate the box. The box is not stolen. The cable co, would not give me a concrete reply. Many people around the country are purchasing there own cable box.  When Feb 2009 arrives and all these people try to activate these cable boxes the upgrade to digital will be a fiasco.Do to Comcasts ruling I will lose $48.00"
1,"   In December I was going to cancel my cable yet keep my internet service. A customer service rep told me that I qualified for a cheaper rate and that it would only be a little higher than the cost of internet alone yet it would still save me around $30 a month with out me loosing anything I currently had. This package was basic digital cable and HBO was a part of that package. I agreed and my bill has been around $70 every month (versus the prior $105 I had been paying), I received my July bill only to find that it was $50 higher than normal so I went to the local Comcast office to see what the problem was. I was told that I had been on a promotonal program and that it had ended and now I was charged not only for basic cable but for HBO in addition to the basic cable. I was NEVER told that the new ""program"" I was put on was only a promotion and that it would end in a matter of months or that when it ended my bill would be higher than it was in December when I originaly wanted to cancell the cable. I changed jobs in January and took a large pay cut for personal reasons, I was not prepared for this additional charge and really can't afford it. I  do not understand why I was not fully informed that I was being put on a temporary program and that when the program ended the bill would be higher than it was to begin with.  When I called Comcast I was told the same thing by the representative then when I inquored about downgrading my service I was told I would have to pay a $15 fee to have a technician come out to downgrade me, if I need to downgrade then obviously I can't afford additional costs, I would understand having to pay to upgrade a service but it is ridiculus to have to pay to downgrade. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that managers do not usually deal with basic misunderstandings. I want some answers and some type of adjustment to my account be it credits or my bill readjusted to what I was charged in December for the same package.

1,"   My  91 year-old father, who had been receiving Comcast Cable service in his apartment moved to a nursing home in March.  Comcast was contacted to set up his new service in his room at the nursing home as well.  We have been paying his bill online each month through electronic payment.  Yesterday, August 4, I received a letter dated July 25 saying that he was going to be cut off for non-payment unless a payment (including late charges)  was received by August 6.   After reviewing my fathers online payments, it was clear to me that the bills had been paid ($417.59) for the same Comcast account number since March 10.  The last payment went through on July 23.  But when I called Comcast I was put through a merciless inquisition that was punctuated by several put-on-holds.  Apparently all of  the late payments were my fault because I did not change his account number in my online banking account. Yet that did not stop Comcast from ACCEPTING ALL THE PAYMENTS.  In my book, this constitutes FRAUD.  I also learned that the first three payments for which I used the wrong account number were miraculously credited to the new account.  But the subsequent two payments were not.  Now I hadn't changed anything in the way I was paying the bill, but Comcast would not accept any responsibility. They also said they couldn't erase any late fees unless I stayed online and waited for a supervisor. If there was an alternative to Comcast to get Fox news for my father I would switch in a heartbeat. One hour of my time wasted with Comcast bureaucracy "
1,"Lost phone service on sunday call trouble desk. the rep said some one would be out monday 080408 between 9am - 11am no one call to say i will be there so i place another call later that afternoon and the rep said someone is on the way. no show up, i place a third call only to told that someone would be out here on 080608 between 9am - 11am. this is worng  we lost a hole day waiting for someone to fix the problem, all the errands that were to done were put hold now rescheduled for another date. just give me your money and be quiet"
1,"Comcast customer service is miserable. If you're as unlucky as me and have to rely on this company because of a lack of alternatives than save yourself 30 minutes and don't bother calling up to ask them even the most simple billing questions. I just spoke with a CSR who couldn't explain the most basic question: where did a balance carry over on my bill come from. The CSR also didn't understand the difference  between a credit and a debit.  To top it off, she was the rudest person I have dealt with over the phone in a long time.  Just a colossal waste of time to wait half an hour just to get talked down to by someone who is supposed to help you."
1,My wife and I are out of town and my wifes sister is watching our four children for us while we are away. Because of where we live in the country cell phones rarly work if at all. I called comcast to let them know our situation and that we needed to be in contact with our children. The rep on the phone confirmed that our phones were indeed out and even though I explained our situation to her she said the earliest she could get a technitian out here was not until wednesday the 6th of august. today is the 4th and I said you mean to tell that I will not be able to contact my children for 2 days and she repeated that the soonest she could have somone out there was the 6th. what can I do I am at there mercy with no recourse.  What happens if there is an emergency and my wife and I need to be contacted. One of my sons is autistic. Now instead of a relaxing couple of days we'll be concerned about the situation aat home.
1,"I was told that an engineer would come to set up Comcast equipment today, so I took time off from work to be here. Only after the time window had come and passed did I contact Comcast only to find out that they had rescheduled for the 13th. I was not told AND they could have installed the equipment and made the requisite changes on the 13th (while other functions would have been available).Lost productivity. Only approximately $400 lost to me personally, but my time is billed out at over $250/hour, so $2,000 lost in potential revenue for my employer."
1,"Last week, we waited patiently during the four-hour window we were given for a Comcast technican to repair our OnDemand service.  When no one showed up, I called customer service, and was told that someone had called to cancel the appointment.  I'm the account holder, and I did not make that call, I asked the representative how that was possible (especially since the company typically asks for the last four digits of the payer's Social Security number).  We agreed to another window--this time three hours today--from 8 until 11 a.m., with a call 30 mins. in advance to let us know a technican was on his way.  I confirmed the appointment this morning, but at 10:50--ten minutes before the window closed--he called and said, It is a system-wide problem so, as a practical matter, there's no reason for me to come.  Besides, he said, he was running behind schedule, so it would not be before 11 in any event.  Given his comments, my suspicion is that the OnDemand service does have deliverability flaws, which is a system-wide problem. And my suspicion is that a technican likely canceled our first appointment--leaving us to wait for three hours--twice.  "
1,"since March, I have been charged a fee of $40.00 by Comcast for missing equiptment.  They claim I have a modem that was not returned.  We just moved into our home last August and had a Comcast technician set us up with the Comcast bundle.  Since we have lived here, I have never had a technician come in and replace my existing modem.  When I call comcast, no one seems to know what the missing modem is all about and just keeps telling me that they will have the problem researched.  I just received a call from Comcast saying that it possibly is a modem from my previous address and I probably didn't return it when we moved.  I thought, wow, that is an interesting, since my provider at my previous address was VERIZON!  I am getting no where with them and was told today that I need to go into my local Comcast office and talk to them.  Very frustrating that they claim to be the largest cable/internet provider around yet, they can't get their own inventory straight so they just think they can charge a customer for no reason.Still getting charged every month for this missing modem.  Have not paid the fee and refuse to."
1,"We purchased a new HDTV, and then had to obtain the required HD box from Comcast.  Soon we started hearing an annoying static like clicking sound, that would come and go over time.  After several months, we started hearing it more and more, and on many more channels.  We asked a few other Comcast customers that we knew if they were having this same problem.  When no one was, we thought it was the TV, so contacted the store.  Not being huge TV watchers, and the fact that it didn't happen every day, we tried to ignore it.Finally we called Comcast.  I will say, we have always had a technician respond in a timely and courteous manner, unlike some of the other complaints listed here.  However, we discovered that it was not the TV, but the box that we had been renting each month to receive the HD channels (on an HDTV, go figure).  The tech told us they had problems with these boxes, and replaced it. Problem solved, but we feel that we should not have had to pay for a faulty box over that long of a period of time, especially when Comcast knew they had faulty boxes installed in people's homes.  Shouldn't there have been some kind of recall?  I doubt I will ever be able to resolve this issue, but know that like others, we are also very disgruntled with Comcast. I also have high-speed internet with them, and have noticed ALOT more problems lately.  THere is not a day that goes by now that I am not experiencing some type of problem with the internet - from interrupted service to the blocking of my out-going emails.  When I called to fix the issue, I was told it sounded like a security issue, and that I was suspected of spamming.  Oh, puh-LEASE!  Sending pictures of the kids to grandparents is spamming?  When the tech on the other end of the phone line told me what changes to make in my system, he acted like I should've already known that.  When I asked how I was to know something like that, he said it's on the Comcast website.  Remind me to read it someday when I have a minute . . .

1,"As a Taxpaying, American Combat Veteran, I will swear under oath this is a true story & the story before you has been condensed believe it or not.  Today is 07/30/08 and I have been a Comcast customer for 10 years plus.   A couple of weeks before our move date, my wife called and scheduled a ""Transfer Date"" for our Comcast service from old residents to new.  Date was set for Aug. 9th. July 23rd Comcast came out and told my wife they were going to turn off our service.  (Wife works, but home due to relatives in town).  My wife told them no, the date is August. 9th. so the Comcast employee told her ""Fine sign my paper work"", she did and noted on the paper work that the day is Aug. 9th.  (Comcast now has been told twice.) July 26th I believe (Saturday), my services are turned off.  I spent 3 + hours, cut off multiple times while speaking to 8 different people, to include managers, on the phone (cell phone) with Comcast and had 2 people tell me to leave my number with them as to give me a call back.  The second person was very adamant about their call back skills.  I received not a one call from either person.  All this time I am being told ""How sorry Comcast is and how sorry they are for any inconvenience they have caused.""  Due to their mistake (which they did admit to), I have now missed a meeting on Saturday night, because I have no internet and phone.Sunday (the 27th), spent another 4+ hours with again 6-8 people, cut offs etc. on the phone and was told I would have to cancel existing service and open new account because this the original account was closed by them.  ""Let's do it"" I replied.  Comcast said that they would expedite the order for Sunday or Monday.  ""Someone has to be at the residents for them to activate service"" they told me.  Even though I explained to them that no one needed be there for them to turn it off!?  Part of my lively hood depends on email, phone & internet, so I told them ""My wife will be there!""  She sat there all day Sunday, no one showed or called. Once again I am on the phone in the evening for a couple of hours, with multiple people being told everything is approved, here is an ER ticket number, still more smoke. Monday rolls around so I call Comcast once again around 8:15 a.m. and was told that a Mr. W. is working on the account, but will not be until 9:00 a.m.  I call at 9:15 a.m. (again on hold, cut off, giving the same info for the 24th time and yet it never seems to stay in the system), when finally I get though, not a soul at Comcast knows who Mr. W. is.  I then speak to another manager, who I am cut off from, so I call once again.  Finally get hold of a different Manager and he tells me someone will be out between 1 and 4 today or on Tuesday.  I told him that this is unacceptable, due to the fact we have been told Sunday and Monday and have been there (wife had to take a day off work, more lost money) and I can not be there on Tuesday and this problem was started on Saturday by you people.  I told him if we cannot make it work, I will have to find a new provider.  I get a phone call from a lady in the ""Phone department"" from Comcast and she told me she will handle it.  Get home Monday night on the phone for another 2 hours, talking to managers to try and find out why no one is coming.  She proceeds to tell me she does not see any of these work orders that her other co-workers are talking about. So no one is coming out tonight.  I told her to cancel my account with Comcast and that I would return their equipment at my leisure & to not forward another bill, because it will not be paid due to the finical lost that I have incurred because of a Comcast mistake.  Total is approximate. $500.00 to $600.00 and climbing due to missed work, not able to get work done, time on phone, cell phone costs etc.  Again they told me how sorry they were and they wish it did not have to end this way.  I told her ""no you're not, otherwise you guys would had someone out here by now (3 days later after we were told to be there for 2 of the days and someone was)  and no one has EVER brought any type of financial restitution (credit for a few months service, free upgrade or something?).Tuesday rolls around, I get a call back from the lady in the phone department!  Yeaah!  I explained to her what had happened; she said that no one closed your account.  I replied ""that does not surprise me, because no one at Comcast seems to know what they're doing or even keeps their word.""? Again, sorry for any inconvenience blah, blah.  She explains to me that she has some one going out there to hook me up and that I do not have to be there.  All right, ""if you can make this happen I will be a Comcast customer again.""  She calls me back around 4:00 p.m. (Tuesday still) and asked if someone will be there between 4 and 7 tonight.  The Comcast service man was out there and hooked everything back up, but his supervisor said he needs to be there for whatever reason.   She set appointment for 5:15p.m.  Here we go again, wife was home by 4:55p.m., I get home at 5:40 p.m., no one has shown or called!  Hmm surprising?  I call Comcast again, a gentleman tells me the guy is in the area, a few minutes away and he has on his notes to knock on door, because our current phone # is disconnect.  So I have to give him my cell number again, like I have done 3 dozen times with an array of people so far.  He then tells me if he is not there by 6:15p.m., to call Comcast back.  It is 6:00 p.m. now (and I am not kidding), I look out the window and a Comcast van drives right by.  I would have yelled out the window, but a/c is on because it is summer time. I call Comcast and let them know what has happened, the lady tells me there are many drivers and that he will call you at...she then repeats to me my disconnected number, and does not have the contact number I have given 2 + dozen times.  6:15 p.m. rolls around, no call, no one shows, so I call again as told by Comcast.  After being on hold another 20 minutes, a lady tells me that ""yeah no one is coming out, because this was canceled yesterday.""  How could something that was set up today be cancelled yesterday? I even asked her if this is a joke?!  Or is there a camera around here?  This is insane!  I am now on hold waiting for another manager.  Finally get hold of someone and she ""tells me that she sees that someone should have been there and that my appointment was not cancelled, that my ""equipment is hot"", so someone would have had to been there.  ""Yes I replied, when we were not there, but then I was told to be here and I am and still no one has shown.""  ""I am sorry for the inconvenience...I stopped her in mid sentence to explain that we do not have time for this and to try and get the service guy who drove right by, back out here!""  She put me on hold took my number and said she would call me back no matter what.  I still have not heard from her.  She did transfer me to the phone department, who after an hour or so of trouble shooting, got the phone to work.  (Cable was being tested and fixed before phone). Now, on to the Internet issue.  For the next 2 hours we sat there resetting this and that, changing settings here and there and had a connection at one time, but I was reassured it was old web pages that my computer remembered.  Does the computer remember your internet connection speed when looked through the control panel?!   We had a connection for a second. Some everyday web address did not work, for example Comcast's did not work.  hmm?  More trouble shooting and finally ""I will have to get someone out there"" is the response I get from Comcast.  The gentleman set the appointment for today (Wednesday the 07/30/08 between 4 and 7) again have to leave work early, more money lost) to meet the guy who will verify everything is hooked up outside. ""If it wasn't I would not be talking to you on my landline!"" I replied.   Friday the 1st is also another appointment for a totally different tech to come out.  Comcast is really bending over backwards here!  No wait that's ME!  So Tuesday night I was on the phone pretty much from 5:45p.m. until 9:45ish p.m. and still no internet.  I then took it upon myself to hook everything back the way it was and reset everything (if you want something done right, do it yourself) and it worked!  10:00p.m. the lady who was working with my phone line and who had transferred me to the Internet tech called back and asked if everything was working?  I explained to her ""maybe?""  We are keeping the scheduled appointments (if you can call them that) as to double check this problem that should and would HAVE NEVER HAPPENED if Comcast would just have followed directions. Today is now Wednesday and I have received a call from one out of the 3 or 4 trustworthy employees (who does what she says she will do), and I explained to her what had happened.  We have come to the conclusion that I am not taking off anymore work and the appointment for this evening has been cancelled,  (because everything seems to be working) but we are leaving the Friday appointment open just in case.
It has now been 16 + hours of phone time, a meeting missed, a higher cell phone bill, missed day at work for wife and I could go on about time lost that was supposed to be for moving.   I am still in shock over all this and I have not given up on the idea of a new provider.  I just need new service installed before I give any direction to Comcast. (Insanely lol).  I am waiting for a corporate email and number, as I intend to forward this on to corporate to let them know what kind of employees they have working for them, along with their INSANLEY POOR customer service.  I do honestly believe this whole letter and more time spent on this will be in vain, but it has to be done just for the simple fact and hope that no one else has to deal with their incompetence!Sunday (the 27th), spent another 4+ hours with again 6-8 people, cut offs etc. on the phone and was told I would have to cancel existing service and open new account because this the original account was closed by them.

1,I Have had problems with comcast since they took over our accounts as Patriot Media customers back some months ago from the very first bill being incorrectly stated which I managed to fix after many hours over the phone. Now this last problem seems to have no fix to it. I decided that Comcast my new provider of Digital Phone service was too expensive so I decided to get Vonage at the start of May of 2008 or rather at the end of April 2008. I had contacted Comcast about this change and asked that my billing be adjusted accordingly and I was assured it would be yet it was not and it continued to be billed dispite my continued efforts and many contacts to the support people. I even asked that they review their own records to see that no activity under their own accounting shows my phone number being used past the dates mentioned yet they insist on billing me for the time frame only discounting me a small $20 amount. I have tried to explain till I have been blue in the face with so many lies that I just do not know what else to do.My account has been threatened to be disconnected dispite my continued attempts to pay what I believe to be the correct amount on time and contact both billing and customer support by both email and phone.
1,"We have the package that includes the cable, internet and phone.  We have been having problems for months and have called comcast several times.  About 3-4 months ago, the picture on cable started fading in and out. We Comcast and the technician told us the wiring had nicks in it and needed to be redone, but he couldn't do it. We needed to call and schedule for another technician to come do that. The second time we waited and no one showed up, and the no one could get in touch with the technician scheduled to come. So a third appointment was made. This time two technicians showed up an hour late, but they at least fix the problem...temporarily. The picture still fades in and out, and I just realized that when the cable acts up so does the phone. I can be on the phone talking and suddenly the person on the other end cannot hear me for about 30 seconds, then it clears up. I called last Friday to complain and fortunately, the phone would loose connection while I was talking to Comcast. He ran connection test and found that my connection was week. No other customer service person had told us that. Now the problem is getting someone to show when they say they will. I was given the time frame between 2-5 pm today. Took off work early, came home to wait, and wait, and wait. My husband called comcast at 5:00 pm exactly and found that there was not appointment for us today. Then he was told that the technician called and could not reach up. We found that the wrong number was listed for us. Each time we call Comcast with a problem, we have to update our phone numbers. For some reason, the numbers keep changing and we're told that they couldn't reach us. We've rescheduled AGAIN for a technician to come out and I'm not optimistic that they will. If I keep having problems with Comcast and their service doesn't improve, I will be changing.My time is very important. Each time we make an appointment, that means that I have to rearrange my schedule only for Comcast not to show. Today, it was four hours without pay to wait and them not show up. Comcast has a very poor service record with me and I'm getting tire of it."
1,"When Comcast come to install cable in 2007, items were stolen from my home during the time they were there. The technicians were two women, one of whom asked to use my bathroom about 3 times in the 40 minute visit. When I called the company, after seeing that jewelry items from my bathroom were stolen. I was deterred from filing a claim using intimidation tactics. When I moved apartments, I made an appointment to get my cable installed and requested that the same technician from before not come. They failed to note that request on my account as I had asked. It took me multiple calls to determine if the person who was coming, had, in fact, come to my apartment before. I finally decided to file a claim for the prior stolen items. However, I have received no customer service assistance in obtaining the status of my claim since, despite the claim being labeled as a priority #10, and the old technician being fired for theft (as I found out)! All calls into the claim officer who initially called telling me that he was handling the case go straight to voicemail. Attempting to get a supervisor on the phone is a joke - I have left messages 4 times and they are never returned. I have no other cable options in the area, so I'm stucking paying money to a company that doesn't even respect my own security or their own customer service standards  "
1,"I moved about a mile in St. Paul to a new location and set up a transfer of my cable with Comcast. I was given a date and time for the transfer so I could have continued uninterrupted service.  On the day of our move, I went over to the new place and sat there for THREE HOURS waiting for a comcast installer to show up as promised. Finally I called when the latest time passed and asked what's up. I was told that the install had been canceled! It was canceled due to a bill for Time Warner in Minneapolis from 2002! I had moved with comcast several times and never had this happen, nor had they ever refused my service. I always paid my bills (on time too!) to comcast and suddenly they were blocking my cable and canceled my installation without even calling me because of a 2002 cable bill with Time Warner Cable that I hadn't even been privy to a bill on?   I wasted three hours waiting, and was left with NO channels.  I told them to go ahead and zero out my account entirely, that I'd be getting a dish.  What a way to treat a customer. I have given them a ton of my money for years, and never complained about their exorbitantly high costs. Never again.   Welcome to DSL and satellite and goodbye comcast and all your drama. We currently have no channels on our television at all and are wasting time researching different options for satellite which we could have done prior to moving had they called.  I wasted three hours on the day of moving waiting for them of my time due to their disrespect- again, a simple phone call that they don't want my business would have sufficed. I'm glad to give my business elsewhere. I sell on half.com and was unable to access the internet due to not having a connection to see if there were any issues with current sales or any new sales."
1,"I'm a Senior Citizen and had mistakenly overpaid Comcast bill by $160.00. via telephone on July 25.  I had already paid my bill on July 23,2008 for $213.00.  When I called and asked for a refund of the overpayment they said it would take 2-3 billing cycles in order for me to receive a check.  I told them it was unacceptable for the length of time as they accepted my money immediately!  Sorry but they suggested putting it towrd future billing, which I did not agree to.  They are using my money for services not received.  I am filing a complaint with the Attorney General and BBB in my state of Colorado but don't expect any help.  Maybe the media, whom they subsidise can help? Bet Not.  I'm considering switching to Direct Tv.No refund forthcoming and I can't pay my bills for the month because of this oversight."
1,"ALERT!  You are NOT protected with your alarm system's monitoring if you have Comcast Digital Voice and the DV goes down.  Comcast DOES NOT tell you this when selling the DV.  In addition, your safety is compromised if someone (thief or worse) cuts your cable line.  Your alarm will ring but your monitoring system WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED that there is a problem.  Comcast will tell you if the power or cable TV goes out, your phone switches to a battery modem for phone service, thus your alarm monitoring is not interrupted.  But they don't tell you if someone cuts the cable line to your home you are NOW at the mercy of the buglar or WORSE.  This information should be given PRIOR to installing digital voice for the customer to make a decision.  This is a lawsuit waiting to happen"
1,"   I have reported this to the FTC, FCC, BBB, the Comcast SVP of Cstomer Operations, the State of New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and now here - and I will keep on going until something gets done! Today 07/27/2008 I called your Customer Service department to terminate only the phone portion of my Comcast Triple Play bundle, after having had QUITE a few service issues with the (lack of) service provided.  The Agent, Damien whom I spoke with at approximately 14:25 informed me there was no supervisor available for me to speak with, even AFTER I had informed him I intended to contact the Better, Business Bureau.  I was so unsatisfied with the outcome of our conversation that not only DID I file a complaint about Comcast with the BBB, I also filed one with The State of New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and will continue to search other mediums where I can report and/or complain about your company until we reach a satisfactory resolution to this problem. Here's what that call related to (if you are interested): I've been a loyal Comcast customer since 2001. I had Comcast of Northern Virginia and they provided me with excellent internet and cable service, it was by FAR superior and MUCH less expensive and I believe I NEVER had to call them for a technical or service issue.  Whatever franchise is now providing my current service in my area (Community ID: NJ0297) is sub-par and their products are unacceptable.  Since the beginning the service to my new apartment I've ran the entire gamut of service issues.  Please allow me to list them for you, since I feel you should be made aware. 1. The packages in NJ offer less for more money. 2. The fact that we have to use the old modems show how dated the service here really is. 3. When I went to the North Arlington Service center to get an additional DVR box, the lady who (for lack of a better word) 'helped' me, didn't bother to hang up from the personal call she was on, and while still on her cell phone, gave me a CCAT box but gave me the wrong connecting cable AND failed to give me an AC cable (to plug it into the wall) - I had to take time out from my busy day just to go back to get the right items. That box didn't work from the get go - there had been a tech who came out to look at it and got it to work some what but the Globo channel was still all pixilated and eventually the box stopped working completely.   4. The service in the room where the 2nd box was never right and it took me some time to notice as that is where my husband was supposed to watch his soccer - I never understood why he ended up watching it the living room instead - until one day when he had the living room TV occupied so I went back there to watch one of my shows on the 2nd box.  What do I find? Only local TV channels would show; yet I've been paying for the additional box, its DVR service and the packages (Globo PPV, Selecto, and Sports) since April!  I paid for services I never got!  I went back yet AGAIN to get another DVR box at the suggestion of a Customer Care rep who thought the box might be fried (at least she gave me a $50 credit) and IT TOO still didn't work!  It was a second tech who caught the the fact that the cables were plugged in backwards -- the first tech completely missed it. Finally, as of July it now finally works. 5. The phone service is unreliable.  Oftentimes I have to reset the modem just to get a dial-tone. Luckily if I have an emergency at least I have a cell phone. Yet, the main reason why I got the home phone service is my mother (for when she visits) and to call her when she's away - lengthy conversations on a tiny cell phone are very uncomfortable.  But the service is so slipshod that what's the point? 6. I used to use calling cards to call my mother in the Dominican Republic; I stopped using them towards the end of May and started just dialing her directly. That's when I noticed another major service issue, this time with the phone. When I would call her, I would get a dial tone (or have to reset the modem JUST to get one), then dial her number as usual (1-809-xxx-xxxx) and then it seemed my phone line would go dead - no sound; but she heard her phone ringing, she would answer it and talk, yet she couldn't hear me, nor I her (I couldn't even tell her phone had rang!). I made 30 or so calls like this (and paid for everyone them) even though I 'TECHNICALLY' never got through.  I thought maybe it was the phone lines over there (after all THEY'RE the one's that are a 3rd world country-that their phone system was failing was more plausible to me); and had her service provider (Codetel) troubleshoot her lines - all was well they said.  Now she's a 77 year old and I hadn't been able to speak with her for almost a week, I really needed to find out how she was doing - so I resorted to Operator Assisted calls, I made 5 or so assisted calls (and paid for those additional charges too); miraculously the operators were able to get through.  I called Comcast about this several times; once I was told to dial 011 first to make a call to the Dominican Republic (and this was technical service rep who said that)! Finally another rep told me that the international provider Comcast was using had the configuration wrong, and has since corrected it; that I could call the billing department to get credit - by now I'm so disgusted that I didn't even bother to get credited back.  So, supposedly now that the problem is allegedly corrected, to make matters even funnier.... 7. Now when I call my mom, I hear her line ring, we hear each other but its static-y & full of interference, and like we are talking over each other; so garbled & distorted we can't communicate. If I have something of real import to say I have to ask her to call ME, and her calls to me are always crystal clear. Yet I can't have her running up her bills like that.  I think the maybe issue is your phone service is digital and it can't handle international calls. Today (07/27/2008), around 14:10 I called my mom; it was 5 tortured minutes of constant repeating, more screaming, trying to modulate our voices just to be heard, and slowing down our speech patterns. I had to hang up from sheer frustration and get an operator to place another assisted call - and this time, even the operator assisted call got messed-up too.   Now, I've been a loyal Comcast customer for 7 years now, and for the last 8 months I've paid in full for a service I frankly feel I haven't been getting, after those last calls to my mom I had reached my fill and decided I had had it -- that I don't want this shabby service and would just get a conventional analog line from Verizon. So right afterwards I called Comcast to terminate the phone service immediately, a male rep who said his name was Damien said I would be billed a $150 penalty for early termination of my contract and my remaining services would go up to full price. I advised him that after so many issues with my service I intended to call the BBB and would rather speak with a supervisor first - he told me the was none available to speak with me and that I could schedule to have a technician come out and have a look at the problem. Not being offered any other alternatives from Damien, I had no choice but to accept the appointment for Tuesday the 29th between 9am and 12pm.  Yet I have to say that I'm VERY IRATE about having to take time out of MY schedule for YOUR service issues yet AGAIN.  I had plans for Tuesday and I'm a working person - I can't be doing this every time you guys fail! Quite frankly I don't care about paying full price for anything as long as I get what I pay for, but I feel that in this case the $150 penalty would be highly unjustified given the fact that the reason for the early termination is because Comcast hasn't lived up to it's end of 'our' agreement.  At this point, I really no longer wish to have any type of  relationship with Comcast - no cable, internet or phone - I would just as well go else where for my services but Comcast intends to have the gall to bill me for an early termination fee after all that has happened.  That's just appalling and absurd. Please let me know of any resolution to this situation which may be satisfactory and agreeable to both Comcast and my self.

1,"We have finally canceled our television service because we cannot take it anymore. Our internet was down for two weeks, and every time we would call they would put us on hold until we hung up. Finally, after about 10 calls, we talked to someone and we just canceled our television service, just to spite them. The guy came out to put a hold on our tv service, and somehow canceled our second IP address. We call them, and they want us to pay ANOTHER activation fee to hook up the IP address WE ALREADY HAD, THAT THE TECHNICIAN CANCELED. They've done this several times: the tech comes out and somehow removes/destroys/alters our service, and they charge us AGAIN for something we already should have. We have looked at other services, but there are NO OTHER cable services in our area. PRETTY SCARY that next year everyone will have to switch to dish or cable, and comcast has a monopoly in our area. Even worse, there is NO ORGANIZATION, government or otherwise, that a consumer can complain about them. Right now we are between a rock and hard spot because we cannot afford and cannot have dish (we rent), we don't want dial-up, and comcast is the only cable in offered in our area.  Lame!  I just wish that there was someone/some place who CARED, or that Comcast would be forced to share their lines with another company. I would even PAY MORE to get cable through another company. I think what we're going to be forced to do is MOVE so we have more choices.-Everytime we have upgraded our service, the technician hasn't shown up for the appointment. We call, and we end up having to take more time off work/wait more hours for the technician to show up. -I have lost count of how many times they have hung up on us for complaining. -They customer service is rude, and none of them know what they are talking about EVER. It took 45 minutes (well, before they hung up on us) just to get them to tell us we didn't have a second IP address. Our internet goes down once a month--without fail. For at least a week, or sometimes, every night after 9 pm for several weeks. We have complained, and they say we're in a black out area. However, it's not removed from our bill. -We have had to take several days off of work in order to wait for the cable technician everytime we have to make an appointment. The Tech never shows, shows up several hours late, or we are forced to make a second appointment. This has happened ALMOST EVERY SINGLE TIME. Now, we are smart and make our appointment on Fridays, so at least we'll get a three day weekend."
1,"I have a frustrating experience from beginning to end:  **** Installation: Ju;y 2005 **** Because we have internet connection problems, we have them come in to fix it.  Then, in an accusational tone, because they did not deactivate the services we accidentally obtain from the previous tenant's cable package, the cable guy talked to me like I am a suspect in an interrogation in the police office.  Like we should have reported to them that they made a mistake and gave us more programs that we paid for.  After dealing with very arrogant Comcast employees and continously disappointing unavailable internet connections, we decided to swith to SBC Yahoo (now AT&T).  *** Disconnection: July 2008 ****  Imagine being called after 9pm on your cell phone from the cable guy asking you to QA whether the cable got disconnected!  Then, he HUNG UP on me after I was so nice to actually move my butt and meander through heaps of boxses (amidst packing + moving) to turn on the TV and gave him the answer."
1,"I'm complaining about the complainers.  I have called Comcast three times with problems.  They have been prompt, professional and polite.  "
1,"I am trying to watch my budget and called to cancel my TV service with Cocast Cable. I advised the representative that I would be keeping my high speed internet. His first response is that I would be paying more for my internet because I would no longer have a bundle. I let him know that I was aware of that and still wanted to cancel. Then he told me that my speed on the internet would be slowed as I no longer had a bundle. He kept insisting that I just go down to a smaller TV package. I do not like being threatened. I became very determined to cancel TV (I spoke with the rep earlier this week and returned my DVR today) and now am researching options for high speed cable. In a few months, I may even go to Direct TV. I live in an apartment and because my management does not allow dishes to be mounted on the building, I had not gone with them to begin with. But I would rather not have TV, if I am not able to get dish, than do business any longer than I have to with Comcast. When I took my box back today, the rep told me that I was going to get my speed lowered online, but could pay $10 more every month and keep the speed (funny enough, that option was NEVER mentioned by the rep I talked to on the phone. I currently work for a call center in town and have actually worked for several other call centers (never Comcast) and have had to speak with customers who are unhappy and/or wnat to cancel. The key is to NEVER be rude to the customer because word of mouth advertising is very volatile. Besides that, if their situation ever changes, don't you wan them to think about coming back to your service? Thanks to that rep I spoke to on the phone, once I find a comparable internet speed, I will never do business with Comcast again. I will also do my best to make sure this story gets heard many, many times by as many people as I can tell it to. I will never do business with a complany that feels the only way to keep my business is to threaten me."
1,Replaced box and never worked.  They tell you managers will call you and they never do.  Tell you they will get someone out and no one shows.  Then find out never even entered work order.  Without cable and no indication will ever get it fixed.
1,"   We have been Comcast customers since we moved into our new home last summer. Unbelievably, we have had ongoing problems with our phone, Internet, and cable services for an entire year! I am planning on canceling all of our series with Comcast in the very near future. At this moment (11:27 a.m.) I am waiting to speak to yet another supervisor who has no idea why my appointment today from 8:00 to 12:00 is not in the computer. The lady I have been speaking with is trying to convince me that I scheduled an appointment when I will be out of the country next week. I have scheduled service calls at least three times, written them down on my calendar, and waited at home for nothing. Each time I call to see what happened, I am told either there is no appointment scheduled or I have the wrong day. We have had our house rewired several times, our yard has been dug up, and my husband and I have taken off work to wait for technicians who never show up. When technicians do show up, there is no guarantee that they know what to do to fix our problems.  We have had so many problems that we have been refunded money and given a free sports package, but it still cannot make up for countless hours on the phone, countless hours waiting for technicians, and countless hours without reliable service. I have never experienced anything like Comcast's ineptness and disregard for quality service! Every time our phone goes out, our security system goes off-line and our Tivo system cannot provide program information. We have had so many problems that we have been refunded money and given a free sports package, but it still cannot make up for countless hours on the phone, countless hours waiting for technicians, and countless hours without reliable service.

1,"Been without cable service for a week due to a problem with the cable line.  Every day I have been promised that someone would come to fix it. To date the closest we've been to a technician is that one day saw a Comcast truck at my neighbors. He had gone to the wrong house!  Then, next day a technician showed up in the rain to say that he couldn't work on it because of the weather.Missed 3 days of work believing the promises that a technician will be here tomorrow as a priority from the telephone clerks."
1,boy I have a good one for you please save your time and your money run for your life from comcast after a week still no tv they say there going to be at my home at 2pm laffin they call my cell phone at 12.00 and say IM here where are you good lord so i tell the man I can be home in just a few Im home in 7 minites and he is not here he calls and says he will see me later what a joke
1,"Ive been trying for the past hour to get through to internet security (the ones who can pull the plug on you if they think you are abusing your bandwidth) Anyway, I got through to this TOM guy, I had a few questions for him.  I did not want to give him my phone number, se HE HUNG UP ON ME! I refuse to go through the endless rounds of pressing numbers again to get through, so I called corporate headquarters. (It took my local office 5 minutes to locate and give me this number) Call them and complain (I did so anonymously, of course)  the receptionist seemed nice (her attitude may change if she starts getting a deluge of complaints) Call your local CORPORATE OFFICE to complain.   My wasted time on hold"
1,"I am greatly distressed over what Comcast is capable of doing without consumer protection. My bill increased and instead of getting more, I am getting less. WHAT HAPPENED TO FREE TV. We had no choice to resort to cable because we needed the reception! When cable was first established it was COMMERCIAL FREE. It seems like I'm paying to watch COMMERCIALS, this has been my biggest complaint. As consumers, we still don't have a choice. I don't want any more channels, I don't want a digital box that I have to pay more for. I am disabled and on a fixed income, therefore I can't afford it. What about other low income families. I quess it's just too bad, because eventually we won't have a any channels. I will just watch DVD's. It's what I do anyway, because there's absoultely nothing on cable. So why am I paying for cable? We all have to get together and do something about this. I thought consumers had rights and choices. Everybody should just stop purchasing cable from Comcast until they can come up with an honest,affordable package for consumers. "
1,"I, like others, have TV sets that go up to only 99 channels. I am a Comcast subscriber and pay monthly for bundled services, including cable TV. I have wathed the analog-to-digital commercials and been certain that the issues did not affect me, since I do not use rabbit ears. What I have learned is this: Comcast is moving channels, such as MSNBC (40), in my area to higher channels (in this case, 251). For 99-channel TV sets that have a direct cable connection--no converter box--these new channels will not be received. Thus, consumers like me will be paying for services under contract that will no longer be provided by Comcast...unless we pay MORE. We have to rent a converter box to get these same channels we've been paying for all along. My question is, if the rabbit-ears customers are being inconvenienced by this digial switchover, and they are being provided some remedy (free converter boxes), why aren't we Comcast customers, who are losing services due to this switchover, being afforded the same courtesy?? I believe Comcast should provide free converter boxes in this case--or discounts to make up for the lost channels. I am being blackmailed into paying for something I already pay for. Comcast is violating their contract by denying me services without remedying the situation. They should give me a discount or provide free converter boxes. I have not willingly changed the terms of my service; rather, they have, without my agreement."
1,"For the past several weeks, one PBS program, The New Hour, suffers many technical interruptions. I've contacted the local PBS station, and they say the problem is with Comcast, Comcast is aware of it, and has not told them that it would fix it.  I've tried to complain to Comcast, and have not been able to figure  out how to do so! This is unconsciounable--that Comcast would make it impossible to complain to them, and that they would ignore a problem that disrupts a popular program.  The damages are to the local PBS station, and to PBS nationally -- when long-time viewers of The News Hour, like me, are so irritated by the frequent technical twitching (at least every 5 minutes or so) that we switch to network news."
1,"Comcast cable tv in my area keeps going out, the sound goes from not being able to hear to blasting. The commericals turn greenish and comcast raised my monthly bill yet they took about 9 channels from me. Also sometimes when the cable goes out weak signal comes on the screen. Phone calls and e mails get me no-where."
1,"Comcast removed 10 more channels from our line up this past week. They (Comcast) have been advertising on TV that if you have Comcast you don't have to worry, and that they will take care of everything regarding the switch to digital. Comcast also sent out postcards tellng people we could recieve a converter box FREE for one whole year to gain access to the channels they just moved to digital.   When I called Comcast and inquired about the coverter box, I was told I would have to pay $111.00 to qualify for the converter box. My Comcast bill typically runs 30 days behind,as the company bills in advance for services. I had just paid my bill on the 16th of July, and now on the 18th they want yet more money.   The FREE Converter box offer expires on August 15, 2008. After that date, it will cost Comcast customers $3.95 a month plus taxes to recieve the channels Comcast just moved and took off our line up.   I imagine there are many people like myself who do not have their Comcast bill current.   Comcast want me to continue to pay for a service I no longer have, and then charge me extra to recieve something that they just took away. I agreed to pay for the channel line up that I started out with at Comcast. Now, I have lost 10 additional channels, yet my bill have not gone down. I also will not be able to get the converter box as I do not have an additional $111.00 to pay before the 15th of August.   I think Comcast should have to do what they have been telling customers they will do. "
1,"I signed up for the $99 promo back in Feb 2007.  Again, never saw a $99 bill.  It was always $149.  Now, the $173 has thrown me over the edge.  One last thing, FOUR MONTHS Comcast debited my checking account TWICE for the same payment.  We can't issue a refund, you'll see the credit on your bill.  Is Bernie Ebbers running this company from prison?"
1,"Sales people and TV people have stated that if you subscribe to cable you will not need the box. Well thats not altogether true.  If you have basic cable without a cable box, you are forced to buy a more expensive service that includes a cable box.  I dont wont or need the extra benefits of this more expensive services all I want is basic cable.  Cable is expensive enough without being forced to purchase the more expensive service having to monthly rent the box from the cable company.  No one can tell me if I purchase the box from Best Buy will that make my TV work with the very basic cable service.  And now that I face having to buy something I cant use or have replaced my expired coupon.I must now upgrade my service and pay an additional monthly charge for the rest of my life for something I don't want."
1,"I subscribe to Comcast Expanded Basic Cable -- analog, not digital This means I get, for example, CNN and ESPN, but not premium channels like HBO. The rules for service are covered in an agreement between the Town of Salem, NH and Comcast. Some months ago, Comcast dropped Channel 48, ESPN Classic. When I inquired, I was told it had moved to a channel number in the 200 range used by digital, which I cannot receive. I asked if there would be a reduction in monthly charges. I was told no. Then some weeks back Comcast did the same thing with a CSPAN channel. And today, I watched a banner on Channel 40, MSNBC telling me it too was moving to the digital side. It is blatantly unfair for Comcast to do this, and in the extreme, I could end up paying  $40 or so for a single channel. A very un-American way of doing business.I can't imagine any other business that contracts to provide a service for an agreed amount, and during the currency of that contract reduces the service and expects to receive the same payment. To call it by another name, try robbery. I have reported this to the Town of Salem, NH after reading their agreement with Comcast. To my unlegal mind, there are clauses in the contract which require Comcast to provide the service they agreed to. In addition, the agreement refers to the quality of service. Since the switch to digital began, my picture will very often go blocky. Clearly the analog and digital signals are interfering with each other. So not only does Comcast engage in robbery, they have not kept up their agreement in terms of delivery quality."
1,"After much research on the internet, for comcast deals, I pick the package I wanted along with the promotional advantages. $75.00 cash back for digital cable $100.00 cash back for High speed internet. $50.00 cash back for digital voice. The bundle would be $99.00 a month.  I called the number to sign up for this bundle. I was told that I needed to clear up a past due amount of 187.00 that was owned on the account since 2002. I was not even aware of the fact that I owed a balance. I had returned comcast equipment in 2002, to go to Direct TV, and was never told I had a balance? Never the less I paid the balance thinking that it was the year my father died and maybe I made an error. I never received any notices.  I was assured that I could sign up for the bundle as soon as I paid the balance. I payed it. Next, I called back the next day and got another rep that put thru my order, but at the last moment the screen said that I had made a duplicate order online and he could not process my order. I had to call customer service again. I figured that was an easy fix since I tried yesterday, they just had to correct something for me to purchase online again. I called and spoke to another rep that told me that I could not have the bundle,because of my Past account. She said the phone representative would never of been able to put that thru, that I was not considered a NEW customer even though it states that I would be after so many months, (it was 6 years since I was a comcast customer). She stated I would have to start out by paying the full amount for the package I wanted, for at least 3 months, and then they would consider putting me into a package. This new package would cost over 175.00 a month in comparison to the bundle which was $99.00 a month. She said that was because my services were terminated for non payment. Non of that was true. She said the only way I could become a new customer is if I moved to another state. phew! I felt like a criminal. I asked if there was anyway I could talk to someone in the office of comcast that was nearest my home, She stated that they have ""walk ins"" and I could go if I wanted to. I decided to try to talk to someone directly, so I went to my Comcast office (Willingboro, NJ) and after waiting in line for 30 minutes was told that no one was able to see me. I went home and on the way, I called and spoke to another representitive of comcast. I just could not beleive this, it did not make sense to me. He told me that the information I obtained was false and untrue. My past account did not show any bad history of payment. I could qualify for the bundle.  He directed my call to a very polite lady named Monica that took my order. My complaint is: If I would of been allowed to go on line and get the same bundle that was offered to me on the phone,  I would of been eligible for rebates that added up to $225.00 cash back. I feel this is a scam and should be looked into. When the representative that tried to process my order online, told me that it said"" that an duplicate order was found"", and he could not process my order"", I showed my concern and he told me not to worry, call this number, that it happens all the time"".  I feel that something should be done about this scam. It it unfair. Part of wanting Comcast was because of the rebates that were offered. I finally got so frustrated I signed up for the bundle on the phone since I knew there was nothing I could do to get the offer that should of be allowed to me online. If you google the different sites there are so many rebates to choose from, and yet I wonder if anyone of them are true? Also, I was told after this happened to me that a close aquantance worked in customer service for Comcast and so many deceptions are told to people all the time. He said it is very unfair and misleading. Stress and losing my online rebate because of deception."
1,I was unable to purchase a movie on pay per view because they said they had not received my payment.  My payment was sent in ten days ago.  I have been a customer for over 15 years so it should not matter if they are getting my payment late.  They could check my credit and see that they are safe with me.  I feel an exception should have been made and they should do whatever necessary to make it work for me.  And they were rude on the phone.no economic consequences other than the fact that I will probably cancel my service and stop giving them my money!
1,After two months of very bad service they turned off my phone after placing order to return to At&t.  Comcast turned off phone two days before scheduled disconnect date and would not turn on unless i canceled my At&t service.  Although I had an elderly person in home I was not able to dial 911 i informed them of this and they said to badd that's my problem. PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM!  YOU WILL REGRET IT!
1,"I have had and am having so many problems with Comcast, 1. They lie about prices they will charge you 2. the phone service is very poor 3. the technicians often don't show up for service appointments 4. they add additional charges to bills without telling you - once they double-charged me for each service and it took about a month and countless phone calls for them to sort it out 5. they have terribly long wait times for customer service, and I have been on hold for over 1/2 hour, then hung up on 6. they say they will transfer you to a manager, but after 1/2 hour on hold you find yourself talking to just anothe regular customer service representative 7. their representatives are often completely ignorant and rude 8. if you write their corporate offices, and, unlike honorable, self-respecting companies, they won't help you, leading me to believe that the above problems are company policy.Frequent loss of phone service; an immense amount of time and nerves spent on hold and talking to Comcast reps who often can't help you."
1,"I have Comcast internet service and have been fairly happy with it until recently.  Approximately 50% of the time that I attempt to access my email through their website, I receive an error message saying my login failed.  I have had at least a dozen phone calls with Comcast techs and nothing they suggest cures the problem.  In fact, since I started complaining about it, the problems have actually increased to the point where there are entire days that I am unable to access my email due to this issue.  Although I have repeatedly complained to Comcast they have repeatedly failed to address this issue at all!  They tell me it is a problem with ME -- oh, please!  How difficult is it to access your email?  Also this occurs while I am actually reading my email at times -- it will suddently crash and I can not access it again until many hours and too may attempts later.  Comcast Customer Service is a joke.  They do not care at all if you have difficulties and they make absolutely no attempt to fix anything that isn't easily fixable. I have lost many hours of productive work time in attemtpting to remedy this problem."
1,"Comcast eliminated local access to Wash DC channels, citing them as duplicative of Baltimore channels. i live as close to DC as to Baltimore, and work in Fairfax VA. I watch (used to watch) DC traffic reports every morning before leaving for work. now i can't do that. and i don't have access to another cable company. i would dump Comcast if i had the option for another company. i resent their elimination of the DC channels.i can no longer become aware of accidents on the route i take to work, some of which close the roads."
1,"I have cable, internet, and phone service with Comcast.  In the last year, I have had technicians out to my house 25 TIMES. I am not exaggerating. I have had conflicting reports about the problem.  One would fix one thing and create a new problem.  The next one would fix that problem and create a new one.  I was constantly told different things.  I bought equipment on their recommendation and took it back on their recommendation.  They would switch out cards on my high definition Tivo at least 12 visits.  I finally took it back and they tried to make their DVR work.  It has been a nightmare.  I have it all documented with all the slips.I am self employed so the financial cost based on my time and hassle totals well over $2500.00.  The emotional and hassle problems have been tremendous."
1,"comcast cable has a community service box, which is over my back deck and across my property line.   I would like to know if comcast cable has iminent domain?The box is an obstruction,when service is needed in ,a ladder is used  and my deck area is tresspassed.Can the cable company just invade my property? that I pay taxes on. I think that I am owed"
1,"   After analyzing our communication bills, we made the decision to bundle our services (cable, internet and telephone landline) with Comcast.  I called Verizon and told them it was not a matter of service, but economics.  I arranged for Comcast to port our phone number to them and set up a bundled package.  An appointment was set up for July 7, 2008 between 3-6 pm.  At 6:30, I called Comcast and asked where the technician was.  I was told the dispatcher would call me.  They never did.  The technician showed up at 7:30 pm.  He started laying new cable and then asked me where the telephone switch was. We live in a high rise condo and I explained he needed to get the key from the desk and they would let him in.  He was uncomfortable with that information and insisted my husband go with him.  Up and down the elevator he would go, on his cell phone, talking to someone and telling them he didn't know how to do the work.  He finally left just before 11 and promised to come back on Wednesday, July 9, 2008 between 3-6 pm, bringing someone else with him to show him how do the work.  No one showed up.  We picked up the telephone to call to see where he was, and our line was dead.  When we called our phone number from our cell phone, the announcement said the number had been disconnected. After an hour on wait, Comcast said that because the work was not completed during a certain time the telephone number ""went back to Verizon.""  The Verizon repair service said that the number had been transferred to Comcast and they did not have it.  This morning I called Verizon to get service and they said they did not control the number, it was still at Comcast.  I had to go through the entire credit and approval process to arrange to get the service back to Verizon.  I will have to wait a week before Verizon can send someone to my home to repair all the damage the Comcast technician did on the 7th of July.  In the mean time, I need to get that recording off my number for security purposes. Comcast kept me on hold for 2 and a half hours this morning until I had to go to a meeting.  I transferred the call to my husband.  He was on hold for an hour before someone came on and said a supervisor would call us back.  No one called. I came out of my meeting and took up the next watch.  Someone from technical support came on and told me that the switch room cant get a dial tone on the line as the work from 7 July has to be fixed.  I was then transferred to Sales, where I was put on hold.  Mark, operator number 4330, said I needed to go to technical support again.   Luckily, technical support was still on the line and interrupted him, stepping him through the process of looking through the case notes.  It appeared that someone deleted the work order on July 8, 2008, and another work order has to be put in.  In the mean time, everyone who calls our home number thinks we skipped town.  I am now waiting to see if Mark will fulfill his promise to call me back and if someone can come to my home tonight, get me dial tone so the recording comes off and for Verizon to port over my number on the 17th of July.  Oh yes, did you know a number cannot be ported over unless it is active with a dial tone? We now have a complaint in to our local government and will be filing one with the FCC.  Should you ever be tempted to give your telephone service to Comcast, don't do it.  They are selling services they know they cannot provide. My husband has lost two days of leave. I have no phone service at my house, with a recording on the number that makes it sound as though I have skipped town. Due to the nature of my work, I am in violation of my organizational policy. We have no idea if this will ever be resolved. I have to fix the damage to my home. I have to pay Verizon to take me back as a customer.

1,"I am writing to regards to my credit report.  At one time, approximately 6 six years ago, I lived in Lake Ridge, Virginia.  I was receiving Comcast services during the time that I was living there.  However, once I moved out Comcast continued to bill me for four consecutive months afterwards. The bill accrued over $150. I disputed it because I no longer lived at the residence, and they said that they would decreased the bill to $70.00 and if I brought in the lease agreement stating my last day living at the address then they would clear the account completely.  The next day I brought them the lease agreement.  I spoke to a supervisor at Comcast and the indicated that they would fix the billing.  However, recently I checked on my credit history, and it indicated that the billing from Comcast had gone to a collection agency.  I feel that the supervisor that I spoke with (I dont recall the name) dropped the ball and did not take care of the clearing and crediting my account, and that my credit report should not have this incident on it.  Can you advise me on how to resolve this matter?  I have gone to Rolling Brooke Rental Office to retrieve a copy of my rental agreement but to no avail.  They do not have records that far back.  And I have gone to Comcast and they couldnt find any record of my account.  So where do I go from here.  I want my credit report cleared.  I was under the impression that it was clear up until one month ago.   My beacon score is affected.  I do not want this on my credit report.  I want it removed."
1,I recently moved and thought that Comcast had great specials and would proove to be a good cable company.  Boy was I wrong.  My service never worked!  I had a DVR that was replaced 4 times over a 4 month period and never worked.  I had to spend numerous hours on the phone with customer service to get no resolution or help.  When I had finally had enough I asked to speak to a supervisor I went strait to voicemail and left many many messages and to this day have never received a call in return.  I had them come and get their faulty equipment and refuse to do any buisness with them ever agian.  I work in Customer Service and I have never seen a company so Poorly managed.  I warn anyone looking into Comcast to stay far away.  They will take your money and give you nothing in return!  They use faulty equipment and have no concern for their customers. I will never make the mistake of using them ever agin.
1,"I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with Comcast's service. I placed an order last month through the internet. I ordered digital preferred with HBO for 39.99/month for six months and high speed internet for 19.99/month for six months. The installation fee was 29.99. I did not receieve an email confirmation so I called the office and the rep confirmed the rates for me. These rates are STILL on website. I paid the technician 92.93 after installation for installation and first month's charges as the rep told me I had to. This was on 06/08/2008. I just received a statement yesterday with completely different rates and was charged again for JUNE-JULY and for July-August. The rates are the normal rates. I was charged 53.21 for cable, 17.95 for HBO, 42.95 for internet, 20.95 for partial month bundle services (no idea what this is), and installation AGAIN, for a total of 199.52. To solve the issue, I first contacted my local office. After half an hour, I was told by both the representative and the supervisor that since I ordered this online, it could only be solved online through a customer service rep as they did not have the codes for internet promos. They could not even provide me with a phone number to contact for online support. So I got on the internet and signed onto chat system. I spoke with a representative for nearly an hour only to be told that they too do not have the necessary codes and I would have to contact my local office. I told her MANY times that I ALREADY called my local office and they were of no help. The chat rep insisted, however, that I call my local office as they would be the only ones that could help me. I then called this number to be told the same thing, that this could only be solved online because the local office does not have access to internet promo codes. This promo has not expired. IT IS ON [THEIR] CURRENT WEBSITE. Everyone has been USELESS and unable to help me. It is ridiculous for a company of Comcast's caliber to not have a copy of my work order for a rep to pull up. It is further unacceptable for the company to not have an account of what my 92.93 was for. All the reps told me that while they saw I had paid 92.93, they had absolutely no idea what it was for. I have wasted nearly 2 hours this morning trying to resolve this with absolutely no progress. Now I have to go home to get the work order during my lunch break, come back to work, then take the bus and train to go to the payment center with the HOPE that it MAY be solved, no guarantees.They have yet to resolve the issue. I am exhausted from trying to get what I should have gotten from the beginning."
1,"I am an avid game player. Recently, most Comcast customers as well as customers of Warner Cable have complained about connection issues with online game. We are experiencing low fps, stutters, packet losses that are over 100% and resulting in massive numbers of CTDs. I even went so far as post my frustrations on in game chat and was immediately given a system wide response to All players that CRS was experiencing problems with both Comcast and Warner Cable which they were trying to resolve with Comcast and Warner Cable companies. The problem, we're told, lies in the band width both Comcast and Warner Cable companies are allowing their customers. CRS tells it's game customers that we should take it up directly with their IS providers. I've done so many times but with no good results as regards Comcast's affording any greater band with that I now currently have. At this point I can do no more than submit this complaint and hope that it doesn't fall on deaf ears as had my past direct endeavors with Comcast.This game costs me $15 per month as a subscription fee. A subscription fee of small consequence to be sure. The lost benefit is not measurable except as viewed from a gaming enjoyment point of view.  I am paying Comcast for good IS provision yet I am not receiving it. I am paying CRS for the enjoyment of their game yet again, I am not receiving it. Both services cost me real dollars. Both are not delivering on their promises or their agreements to their customers."
1,"On April 15, 2008, Comcast employee Billy Woodley came to my home (unsolicited). He was interested in what home phone service we had. At the time we had Vonage phone service and were long-time Comcast cable and internet customers. We had purchased an HD tv in December 2007. At that time, Comcast gave us a 6 month special for upgrading cable tv service to digital preferred plus for $59.99 per month. This service provided more channels than our previous plan, including HD channels. Mr. Woodley said that if we switched from Vonage to Comcast voice that we would continue to receive the same preferred tv plan at the same price after our 6 month special expired, and the comcast voice would be slightly lower in price than our current Vonage price. This sounded like a good idea, so we agreed. Vonage charged us $40 to discontinue their service, but we were still going to get the special price for our cable upgrade. However, when we received our June 2008 statement, our cable tv price had gone up to $103.94 from our $59.99 special. We called Comcast customer service. They said they had no record that we were to continue receiving the same cable package for the same price and refused to reduce our price according to what Mr. Woodley told us. We also called Mr. Woodley's telephone number a couple of times and left messages. He never returned our calls. We are VERY angry about this. We threatened to cancel Comcast service but the customer service people didn't care. We were lied to and feel that we should be given what we were promised and that the employee should be disciplined/fired.We paid a $40 fee to cancel our Vonage phone service, and are now being charge an additional $43 per month for cable, which is not what we were told we would be charged."
1,"On Monday June 30, 2008 Comcast came to install my new neighbor's service. The contractor installers laid the temporary cable in my yard when they could have easily laid it in the new customer's yard. I asked the two installers if they were going to leave it like that and they said it was temporary and the the burial crew would fix it. I also asked if they had plans to dig up  my yard, again I was told the burial crew would handle it. July 3, 2008 I get home from work at 1615 EST to find that Comcast has indeed buried my neighbor's service drop through my yard tearing up the grass on both sides of the sidewalk as well as leaving the orange warning tape and their plastic water bottles in MY yard.   So I get on the phone immediately with Comcast and start my complaint. I am told that a supervisor named Dave will come and see me. I waited patiently at my house until 2030 EST, stood up by the supervisor. When I got up at 0430 on July 4, I called again to start the ball rolling on a supervisor callback and was told the supervisors dont come in until 0800, but that one would call me as soon as they got to work. Well, 0800 comes and goes and no call so I call them again at 0830. Now I'm told again that I would be receiving a call. Now its 1030 and I have called again this time I am given a complaint form number and a telephone number I can call on Monday July 7 to follow up with my complaint. PITIFUL........  So now I have to look at my tore up trashed out front yard all weekend because Comcast is not capable of sending competent technicians to do their installs.   In July of 2006 when I moved into this house, Comcast destroyed the same part of my yard in their attempt to repair the interface in the pedestal in my front yard. After complaing about the mess they left, I was told they would come and clean up the mess. Guess what.......it never happened. Again I was swept under the carpet by Comcast.  While I enjoy their broadband service when its up and running, I have to say they have by far the WORST customer service of any communications company I have ever dealt with and I have dealt with many over the last 26 years being in the Telecom/Communications business.    They wasted my time by missing appointments, trespassed on my property, dug up my yard and left their trash for me to pick up. And this is for my neighbor's service, not mine."
1,"I have had comcast cable for years for tv, it has been ok.  I used to have Roadrunner cable (which was great), until Comcast bought them out.  Then immediately, they capped the bandwidth down to almost nothing.  They slowly have been bringing back up to an acceptable level.  However...they are so misleading and dishonest.  I pay extra for their higher tier internet service.  Do I get? Of course not!  They recently upped their internet bandwidth to 16 Megs downstream and 2 megs upstream.  Do I get that? Ha!  They tell you to go to Speak-ezy and do a speed test, but what they don't tell you is, that speed test is worthless, since they have this misleading thing called speedboost.  What speedboost does it DOUBBLES your bandwidth for a few seconds, then it adjusts to what you are really getting. I have NEVER gotten what they promised.  I have had techs out almost once a week, and they tell is it's acceptable.  I said to the one that was out today, I'm only getting 8 megs, i'm paying for the 16 meg service.  He actually told me, well 8 megs is acceptable, i'd be very happy with that.  AT which point I said, I'm paying for 16 megs and I was told I'd get 16 meg service!  Again he said, well we say UP TO 16 megs.  So they can give you 2 meg service, (which is what i was getting last night), and they are still within their legal rights.  There is NO WAY they can give 16 megs service to those houses.  They can't even give 8 meg service...they have to take the two leads and split them several times to give service period.They talked me into their stupid digital phone service. So I finally took the bate after being hounded to death.  ONly a few days after I accepted it, the power went out, and we lost all services.  Why?  because they didn't have a backup generator on our node.  Now my phone service is not $33 a month as they advertised, but now it's $36 a month, because again fail to tell you they have to charge you for a modem fee too.  I had already bought and was using my modem for my cable tv and internet.  So now to get my internet speed back up, they have to come and put my modem back in for the internet and leave their modem for the phones and tv.  Well it means again, loss of signal because they have to split the signal from their modem to mine.  I can't wait until Fibreoptics are in here, i'll be gone like the wind."
1,"Comcast had sent 2 men to my home on June 3, 2008. When the men arrived they accused me of stealing cable. mind you I had been a customer of there's for over 4 years.  The men pushed their way into my home and began searching my home, all rooms, even basement which is unfinished. I asked them to leave and that they had no business being there or searching my home. They said that If I bothered them again then they were going to disconnct my service. After they left I telephoned comcast, they said they had no work order to even be at my home, there wasno proof that they were ever at my home. I said I could describe the men, they said due to company policy they were unable to offer that as a solution. The following day comcast re appeared at my home to fix a cable box outside, apparently that is the only reason they were ever dispatched to my home. I never had a work order through them. Not only did the tresspass, they threatened me and my family, forced entry and was very ignorant. comcast has been playing cat and mouse with me since to settle on a resolution to this event. In my opinion watch out, comcast is a untrustworthy company to do business with and they have no problem breaking the law. "
1,"Company abused my time by trying to sell a product that was not actually available in the area.  The rep went through the whole sales pitch about what products WERE available, signed me up for cable and internet, and then the rep really pushed Blockbuster Total Access service down my throat, despite the fact I told him six times I already have the service. When he patches me through to the installation department, I get a gruff individual informing me their systems were down, and to call back in 30 minutes  not very comforting!  Naturally, the installation dept number I was given by the sales rep did NOT get me back to the installation dept.  Then, after another 20 minutes on the phone, I am notified that none of the services are available after all, and now I have to deal with cancelling the new blockbuster account that I never needed in the first place.   I cannot believe how absolutely terrible customer service has become.  Reps are not educated on how to use their systems, or how to determine product availability, and then when they are caught on the hop they try to talk their way out of it by giving really pathetic excuses, which always end up reflecting poorly on the company itself.  I really think consumers need to be able to bill their time back to companies like these.  It's unacceptable to waste a consumer's time, and I will NEVER use Comcast in the future.  I'll read a book or use dial up to access the internet before I subject myself to that abuse again.  This is beyond ridiculous.I ALMOST took a day off of work to be there for the installation.  But my emotional distress is beyond measure."
1,"I receved my monthly bill from Comcast and I found a onetime charge of $125.00.When I inquired about this charge they said that a check was returned in April 2005. I totally disagree with this as I don't recall any checks being returned, my question to them is why did it take them 3 years to find this out. When I moved my residence I cancelled my services and after moving I got the service back again, at least at that time they should have known that I owe this amount. I refused to pay this amount.Services were disconnected due to past due balance."
1,"We have had problems with the cable television.  We have not been able to watch, mainly during prime time, due to digital blocking, screeching, sticking, burping, etc. We began making phone calls in April 2008 and Comcast sent guys out who didn't have a clue.  Because it occurs during prime time, cable guys don't work prime time, the problem was never happening. They said our signal was strong, it wasn't in our yard, and it wasn't on the main line.  I made repeated calls and the customer service reps kept circling me through the same redundant process.  I would ask to speak to supervisors and was denied.  Then I began getting billed for the cable guys to come out do the same tests and come to the same conclusions as the others.  I called and spoke to Brenda, supervisor, in billing who assured me that I would receive credit for my interrupted television as soon as they, Comcast, determined the problem and remedied it.  I had been calling since April this call occurred on 5/30.  That meant that as long as Comcast didn't fix my cable I still had to pay for it and I would not receive a credit until they fixed it.  On the phone again, this time two phones at a time, one to complain about the problem, and assure the rep he couldn't help me, I needed a supervisor, and one phone to complain about the representative I was speaking to who wouldn't help me.  Some how I made it to another manager, Joe, who assured me that with in 72 hours all would be fixed and credit to my account would me made.  Not so.  I began my two fisted phone calls for the next three days and on Saturday, 6/8 an expeditor cable tech showed up and ran the problem all the way back to the main hub in Alvin, which is what I kept telling the customer service reps.  This guy did finally show up and fix the problem.  I now should get my credit of mid April to mid June. NO.  I call again.   This time Jennifer refuses to let me speak to a supervisor although she can't possibly give me a credit.  I insisted and insisted and finally she said that  Michael would look into my case and call me back.  When I had not heard from him I called and again, no such person.  I was told at one point that because I didn't call everyday I was was only granted two days of credit in April. Comcast says we owe $301.00 for 2 months of them not delivering service to our home.  We pay $120/month for cable, plus service calls that had nothing to do with our television of $26 each call.  They owe us a minimum of $270.  We owe $31, but comcast doesn't agree."
1,"Our family are comcast customers for years. During this past week comcast customer sevice has demonstrated absolutely the worst service I have ever received. Three days ago I scheduled an appointment,to install a cable for highspeed internet I ordered waited 4 hours and called comcast ten times for service! Noone ever showed or called to let us know anything I decided to schedule another appointment to install the cable for high speed internet. This time the appointment was scheduled for Saturday between 2pm and 5 pm Once again noone called or showed. WE HAD to call over and over to finally get any lame excuse why someone was not here 7 hrs later. Finally a  technician shows up at 9:30 p.m to inform us the work would take 2 hrs to complete and wouldnt do it then it was too dark. So, therefore,on Sunday comcast ordered an appointment at 8 am till 10:00 am. After getting up early and waiting again and  several calls today noone has called back or showed up. In fact they left last night with a unit uncovered and wired exposed to the weather. My Husband and I are apalled to be treated poorly with pathetic service, and we always have payed our bill on time! We know many people in this community and I'm not shy to communicate or inform the media. Seriously if you were treated this way wouldn't it be wise to seek another communication service?"
1,"I had services installed on 5/28/08. In fact in 6/08/08 I had a billed from Comcast that had to be paid in full by 6/11/08, it was only eight day after I had my services installed. I call customer services and spoke to Racheal and she told me that I had fallen in the cycle of there billing which for once I didn't believe her because still to this day I donm't know there billing cycle the statment read as from 5/28/08 to 6/27/08 but I had to paid by 6/11/08.I also ask if they could fix my last name, but they weren't able too. The fact is that I had to go in person to comcast here Lowell, MA and had my last name fix. How incovience I had surgery in 6/20/08 and paid Comcast a visit on 6/24/08 again I ask the same question about the bill, by the customer serives made references that it was like when a person subscribe to a magizine you paid first for there services and brushed it off. That made me very upset. Now I received another billed from comcast and it is due on 7/04/08, try to email them but it has been impossible, I wish to know in how many day it take them to  generate a bill or there billing cycle. The reason they keep changing the day of payments. I paid the first bill on 6/24/08 for the amount of  $101.33 and have written another for $72.42. Ironically, it's been 31 day of having comcast has my internet and phone porvider. If this continue I would like to know my right to cancled their services and not pay one more penny. I live of SSID and all what I was looking to decresed my phone bill and internet because I need my PC I,m a senior at community College.  Please hlep me out here I got the worst deal of my life. Thank You"
1,"How dare Comcast's subcontractor J & E Enterprises think they can tresspass on my property, dig up my lawn and tell me: On July 1st 2008 we will digging up your property  I said I think NOT Then this p[erson] had the nerve to tell me  you have no choice in the matter, we will contact the police and have you arrested if you interfere.  I then called the owner of this scam business and he told me the same thing.  I have written my local polititions and after knocking on door onh my block it appears the entire naborhood is up in arms.  I am now looking at the legalities of permits applied for.  And the legalities of digging up the right-of-ways. [They] may not need a permit to dig up an easement BUT need a permit to dig a right-of-way. Ruining my lawn, threats of having me arrested if I interfere.  Threatened at my door step by a sub-comtractor of Comcast, not to mention the are is not marked up as per NJ state law so there is no concern or precautions taken for safety"
1,Comcast hi-speed internet at $42.99 before taxes and fees is a worthless frustrating waste of time.  The signal drops at least 50% of the time.  I was told to upgrade my computer which I did and it is even worse.  Why are there no choices other than comcast?  I thought that monopolies weren't allowed in this country?
1,"I have been a Comcast customer for a grand total of two weeks.  I have an HD cable box and internet.  Two days ago, both services abruptly cut out.  They totally lost all signal.  I called customer service, sat on hold for 30 minutes and when I finally talked to someone the only solution they could offer me was to send a technician out IN A WEEK!  Here I am....paying $150/month, ALL my services are out....you would think they would send someone out immediately or in the very least, the next day.  But I guess since Im already a paying sucker, they feel like they can take a relaxed attitude towards my problem.  Being somewhat technically adept, I decided to grab a wrench and take a look at my condo's cable box.  I was surprised to find that someone had removed my cable from the signal source and put another cable in it's place.  I got the apartment number and went to their door.  At this point, I thought that this person had done this themselves in an attempt to steal cable.  To my surprise, when they opened the door...standing in their living room was a COMCAST TECHNICIAN!  It was around 6 PM so I am convinced he was trying to get home....he figured, As long as I hook this lady up, screw the other guy.  He can file a complaint later and it will never get back to me!  My cable line has all the appropriate tags.  Any Comcast technician who has worked there for more than a day should be able to identify a customer's lines by these tags.  Yet he had no regard for me.  Simply unplugged me to finish his job. I had him hook my line back up and he left.  (Note: He never once apologized.  On the contrary, he treated me as if I was causing HIM some kind of inconvenience.)  The next day, I notice that my internet is going at about quarter speed.  Also, my ON DEMAND service is completely disabled.  So I go back down to the box and see that the technician, in an attempt to boost my neighbor's signal, has put her line directly into the signal source (where my line USED to be).  Now if you know nothing about cable wiring, you may not understand this next part.  He took my line and put it on a splitter.  Understandable....sometimes necessary.  However, THERE IS NO OTHER LINE ON THE SPLITTER!  Its just the main cable line going into the splitter and my one line coming out.  He could have used a connector to put the two lines together but used the splitter instead, cutting my signal down 3.5 in the process.  This guy was NOT a trainee....he was working alone, which means he has been there for a few months.  His work shows that he has NO IDEA what he is doing.  It is pathetic that such a HUGE company that charges SO MUCH would send someone like this to represent their company.    I am planning on going into the office tomorrow IN PERSON."
1,"I switched my service from Comcast Business Phone to Access Integrated Network.  After the switch was made, we can no longer receive calls from anyone who is using Comcast phone service.  When the call is made from a Comcast phone to our business,the phone does not ring and the call goes directly to voice mail.I have been trying for a week to get Comcast to fix the problem, but so far nothing has been accomplised.  Comcast is not acknowledging that the problem lies with them although it's evident it does.AT&T,Access Integrated Network and Comcast agree that the problem is a translation problem.  I can't see why they can't get the problem resolved.We have many customers who call our place of business with inquiries about our products or to order something from us. We could be losing potential sales and future customers.  I can't put a dollar figure on what we may be losing."
1,"I contacted Comcast for a quotation on their internet service.  After dealing with one rep providing incomplete information, I was passed on to another rep, a sales rep.  The information was still incorrect and I asked for a quote to view in writing.  They said they could not fulfill the request.Luckily no damages occurred as I did not book the service.  What are the consumer's rights?  How are we able to receive a quotation for services requested BEFORE the work is booked?  How can we protect ourselves from bait and switch techniques such as monthly rates changing the month after service is installed (after receiving loss leader enticing rates)?  I have a copy of the chat messages with the sales reps, each passing on the responsibility to another party with no escalation to a manager."
1,"Had Comcast install internet, phone and cable tv in a bundled pkg on 2/20/08, after filling out a form, and was promised a $100 gift certificate after it was installed (and paid for 90 days).  Then I am supposed to wait 4-6 weeks after the 90 days have passed.  I should have the gift card in my hand now. When I call, they say this is handled out of North Brunswick, NJ and they do not have the number there.  They cannot give me a person in Management to resolve this.  They do not care about valid customer complaints/inquiries.I need the money now and I do not want to devote any more of my time to their problem."
1,"When is someone going to force Comcast to provide the service they charge so dearly for?  Because my husband is unable to work due to an injury, he has been trading stocks on line in an attempt to bring some income into our home.  Our Comcast internet service cuts out at least 10 - 15 times per day, often resulting in financial loss because our ability to receive streaming market information is interrupted.  When this first began to happen, almost immediately upon initiating our subscription for streaming stock info, we notified Comcast who checked our service remotely and declared it to be in excellent shape.  Problem continued so we purchased a new computer thinking maybe that was the problem.  Problem continued so we had our software vendor and brokerage account check for problems on their end.  No one else was experiencing any problem so we again called Comcast who again checked things out remotely and discovered that just maybe there was a problem.  Sent out a technician who found things to be working perfectly.  Problem persists - check things remotely again and find that the signal coming into our home is off the charts powerful.  Send out a second technician who puts some kind of reducer on the back of our modem and says that should cut down the signal and solve our whole problem.  Problem continues.  Check things remotely, admit there could be a problem, send out a third technician.  Third technician finds our signal to be +17 when it should be between -5 and +5 with zero being optimum.  We are too close to the tap and the signal is way to strong.  There is discoloration on the back connections of the modem resembling burn marks which were discussed with the tech.  Modem was replaced which brought the signal down to +12 which he feels should take care of things.  My husband astutely pointed out that we were still +7 above acceptable levels and the tech responded that it was too bad WE didn't have a spare roll of cable because he could splice it in to increase the distance the signal had to travel before coming into the back of the computer which would further weaken the signal.  He left after declaring the situation fixed.  Next day, internet goes down at least eight times.  I called Comcast AGAIN and this time when she checks things remotely, she says things have been working perfectly since the modem was replaced and she can not detect that it ever went down.  I just about hit the roof.  Now she said Comcast will send out a line crew because it sounds like we may have a problem in the line which has never been checked before.  And oh, by the way, she issued a $4.00 credit for all our trouble.We will never know the actual amount of our damages.  Not only could we have seen stocks going up but we could have quickly sold those that were going down.  In this highly volatile market, things change in a matter of seconds.  Precious time was lost when we had to log back on to the internedt, our brokerage account, our trading software, and our live feed."
1,"We signed up for Comcast Triple Play in February, 2008. It was our understanding that our costs would not exceed $99.00/month. Since that time our cost has  been between $191.00 and $229.00 per month. The other problem is that the phone works only part of the time. There is often static, echos, 3rd party conversations and times where the other party cannot hear you. Comcast has come out on numerous occasions but has not been able to correct the problem. Every time we call about the bill, we are put on hold for 1-2 hours and they are not able to answer our questions. We also were told when we signed up that we would receive a $300.00 rebate which we never received. When I called today, I was told that they have no record that I filled out any application for the rebate even though I gave them the tracking number I received when I filled out the form online. The tracking number is 16957258. We are at our wits end and are thinking of cancelling Comcast but were told there would be a $150.00 fee for cancelling. We should be given a refund for the phone part of our service, the rebate promised and no cancellation fee in my opinion.My husband works out of the house and often his clients cannot hear him. His clients have told him how frustrated they are when they call and there is nothing on the other end. With all the problems we have had, I'm sure some of his clients have opted for an agent they can reach."
1,"I have 2 laptops connected wirelessly to a Comcast modem for internet service.  Hereinafter referred to as Modem 1  On or about 6/23/08, a Comcast Technician came into my home and installed a second modem to connect directly to a third computer in the home.  Hereinafter referred to as Modem 2  On 6/24/08, while Modem 1 was functioning, neither laptop was able to access the internet.  After an approximate 2.5 hour conversation with Comcast IT employees, Modem 1 was provisioned and access was restored. Provisioning of Modem 1 was at approx. 11:00 pm.  On 6/25/08 at approx. 7:15 am, Modem 1 was still working.  On 6/25/08 at approx. 8:00 pm, Modem 1 again would not permit access to the internet by either laptop.  Additionally, Modem 2 was not permitting access for the entire day.  During the day on 6/25/08, a representative of Comcast advised that Comcast always has problems with more than one modem installed in a household due to their computer system.   After approximate 3 hours on the phone with Cecil and Eric of Comcast during the evening of 6/25/08, neither modem could be effectively provisioned.    As of 6/26/08, I still have no connection to the internet, with an appointment for a representative to come out on 6/27/08 between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., for which I will be missing time from work.  In addition, during telephone conversations on 6/24 and 6/25 with representatives of Comcast, I was mistransferred a minimum of 4 separate occasions during each phone call thereby placing my call back into queue, Hello and thank you for calling Comast. Press 1 for English...  I then had to repeat myself from the beginning for each separate representative.  Comcast knowingly, maliciously and frauduently sold a contract for an additional modem knowing full well that Comcast would be unable to provide service for both modems as was so confirmed.  Additionally, by the adding of the second modem, existing internet service ceased to function completely.  Over five hours on the phone with representatives during the course of two evenings proved absolutely fruitless.  I am losing time and money with no connection to the internet.  I maintain an online business where response time is of the essence.  I am unable to respond to potential customers and existing clients thereby causing me great detriment."
1,"For several months, our cable tv service has been marred by very bad interference in the reception, where the picture and often the sound will freeze. This occurs intermittenly, with no discernable pattern, but it occurs on a daily basis, and often it is so bad that it renders the tv virtually unwatchable. Attempts to have this problem fixed have not been met. One technician claimed this was a normal thing, which is simply not true as it only began happening a few months ago. In other cases they claimed to not know what could be causing it."
1,"On June 2, I went to Comcast's webpage to pay my bill.  When I submptted my information, the response came back as unable to process this request, please try again.  Instead of trying again, I called the automated line to try it that way, and I received the same message.  When I called and finally reached one of the live dummies (Kay) I was told that I had not submitted any payment.  Before we hung up I asked her to check again and she said oh, wait a minute, I do see that you submitted payment.  I asked whether it was submitted twice or once and she insisted that it was only once.  Lo and behold, I checked my account and I am now debited twice the amount I paid.  I immediately called them back and spoke with dummy #2 (Tiffany) who advises that she is going to fix the problem by submitting a claim for on my behalf, and will call me tomorrow for an update.  Tiffany never calls so I get the next one (Janice) who said that Tiffany didn't completely fill out the claim form and that she would now correct Tiffany's errors.  Janice also sent an email to Evelyn in billing.  I asked Janice to copy me on the email, which she politely did.  Well, Evelyn never called or responded, even after I wrote Evelyn directly.  I then called again every day after that and spoke with several different people, the latest of whom was Patricia who said that this was not good customer service and that she didn't blame me for being angry and on the verge of suing.  She then proceeded to promise to call me back on Saturday and even gave me a time.  Now Patricia is in Louisiana (even though I'm dialing a 609 area code) and makes a posture of confirming the time difference and setting the time that she will be returning the call to me with an update.  She even went so far as to say that she is sending the request to two manager who really get things done, Chris and somebody else.  Do you think I received that call?"
1,   I have had comcast for a couple of years now. My sevrice is out every other month. Which doesnt make sense. I called to let you know and it takes an hour to get threw. I have elderly parents and small children that needs a phone incase something happens. You guys are quick to cut your severice off but take your time to send someone out. Never once have I gotten a call back when I left a messgage with a manager.  
1,"I called to have an HD box installed in the bedroom, when the technician arrived looking like a gangster he had no idea why he was there. The tech had no idea how to hook it up. He called customer service and they could not help him. In the mean time all my T.V's went off and no one knew why they went out or how to get them working again. I had to schedule another appointment which was was 4 days later. I have a bulk where I live so I have no choice for my cable provider. Comcast started charging for service calls for bulk customers with the understanding that if it was a problem with the equiptment the customer would not be charged, that is a joke because they will always say the equiptment was fineit was the customers TV. "
1,Internet service cutoff and was told 2 different excuses. One was I was downloading a lot which they never mentioned that when I signed up. Second now is bandwidth which I have no control over. Back to DSL if nothing can be done with Comcast with to much power and control! 
1,"I pay $190 per month for combined TV, Phone and Internet. For the past week, every single morning, our phone and cable has gone out for 2 to 6 hours. Customer service are polite, but tell me to reset the modem or some other stupid thing. When I tell them others in the neighborhood are having the same problem with Comcast, they deny they have an area related problem.  Actually, they have no way of knowing that unless a sufficient number of complaints are received.  I suspect (based on trucks in the area), they are installing new customers and don't give a damn about people who already subscribe."
1,"   I moved into a complex from my old address i dealt with a man named chris at mountain brrok apts .. I changed my phone to comcast, before the move I ask them if i can keep my old number because I have  a loved one in the federal penn they said yes of course you are a valued customer here .. when i got moved into my new place with out my authorization they changed my number . changed my preferred package plan to a promotional plan that i did not ask for in which i said specificallly i wanted it trasferred . when this contractor hooked up my pc he screwed it up I now have damage to my pc and i have to use it as a lap top the router and modum does not work also in th eprocess i lost my phone service and i called and complained all wekend long and no help .. i have them on the phone now asking them what they plan to do about this they have let me hanging as i file this complaint !!!!! i have been online 30 minutes now and the girl that is trying to help me is laughing ..not professional this is against the law what they did going behind my back like this and authorizing all of this that i said i did not want especially my phone becuase in the federal penn .. my ld phne in which they told me over and over that i will keep does not exist now and i cant talk to the prisoner .. i think maybe by now he thinks i have abandoned him ..isnt there a law against them going behind my back and changing things ???? screwing up my pc and not giving me what i ask for with my channels i have them on the phone now asking them what they plan to do about this they have let me hanging as i file this complaint !!!!! i have been online 30 minutes now and the girl that is trying to help me is laughing ..not professional this is against the law what they did going behind my back like this and authorizing all of this that i said i did not want especially my phone becuase in the federal penn .. my ld phne in which they told me over and over that i will keep does not exist now and i cant talk to the prisoner .. i think maybe by now he thinks i have abandoned him ..isnt there a law against them going behind my back and changing things ???? screwing up my pc and not giving me what i ask for with my channels "
1,"I have have trouble with my High Definition cable service for five months.  I have been given every excuse in the Comcast playbook.  Trouble in the area. We are wroking on it.  You have a bad box.  I have already switched boxes twice.  No improvement.  We will snd a service technician.  Two appointments and two no shows.  The last service technician had the audacity to actually file a report that he was at my home and the problem was resolved.  I waited four hours for him and he never showed and never called.  I have been given credits on my account for lcak of service.  I don't want credits, I want what I am paying for.I run a large business in Philadelphia.  I have lost 8 hours of time waiting fro Comcast and has spent untold hours on the telephone on hold listening to their sales pitches and becoming more infuriated by the minute."
1,"It has been 7 days that I am trying to get the service installed. It was scheduled on tuesday between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM and the technician called me at 12:00 and told me that if I want to get service installed, I need to get home now. He was extremely rude and used profain words.  Thursday, I scheduled installation between 5:00 and 8:00. The technicial called at 1:00 and wanted to find out if I can get the installation done than. I requested to keep appointment for scheduled time and he agreed. The supervisor called me at 5:40 that the technician is on the way, no one showed up till 7:00pm, I ran to grocery store at 7:00 and recieved a call at 7:05 that a technician is waiting on my door, requested a 5 min wait but when I got back no one was there. This is extremely rediculous. Comcast treats its customers very bad. I am looking for other options in the area."
1,"I'm paying for high speed internet connection. Comcast promised 6 MG download speed for $42.95. Maximum that I ever had with the Comcast it 2990 Kb - Download speed. 880 Kb Upload speed. I should have 1100 Kb Technician visited my house few times but problem never was fixed. My TV service have problem too. Picture on TV has snow or lines.  I'm looking for another providers.  How much cost stress, frustration, feeling of have been cheated? How much time lost? How many sleepless nights to finish my work because  that slow speed? How much business not done? When I see their commercial on TV I become sick in my stomach."
1,"Comcast is the worst of the worst.  Our house is quite large so we need two connections to get all the TVs.  One line was sitting 1 inch below the ground and when the big truks came to pick up the leaf piles twice a year, this cable is invaribly damaged.  It is often two or three visits just to get them to fix it.  We asked them to bury it and they said OK but the ground team has to come.  After 2 calls the ground team came and buried the cable aboout 1 and 1/2 inches at best and it took all day.  We complained 4 times until they came back and reburied it about 1 and 3/4 inches.  You could kick the dirt and expose the cable.  The next time the leaf trucks came, no service for half the house again.  I asked them if they could run a cable in the attic to connect the other part of the house to the good cable.  They said they don't do that.  I asked who does and they said they did not know.  This was two years ago.  They are so frightfully inept and confused that I have given up.  I can no longer stomach comversation with these people who could obviously not care less.  When they call me with promotions for phone and internet, I just laugh and say no thank you. The only damage is to their reputation which apparently is so bad that my problem matters not at all."
1,I have been without phone service for 5 days and they failed to show up for am appointment.  I have three small children so this is not acceptable.  Please help me as they locked me into a contract and provide poor service and keep raising the costs each couple of months.  This is not fair!I cannot call 911 as I do not have phone service!
1,"My girlfriend has been refused contact with customer service supervisors.  Her service was disconnected accidentally by a COMCAST service person.  She called and a representative restarted her service, however, her high speed internet was not connected as well as she was charged as if she was being connected for the first time.  Everytime she calls now, she is put on hold and then disconnected and refused service.  As I am a comcast customer as well, I think it is totally unacceptable that she was refused contact with a supervisor. She cares for a woman and it puts strain on her schedule to take days off waiting for a comcast technician that doesn't show up - as was the case today(6/12/2008).  also takes classes online and not having internet access is affecting her class performance.  9-year old son has a brain disease called Chiari Malformation and utilizes the internet to feverishly research the disease and any experts that may be available to help in the treatment of her son.   Bottom line, I would like Rick Germano - SVP COMCAST customer support, to contact personally and please re-assure her that this issue will be resolved and the process of rectifying her service and faith that her voice as a COMCAST customer will be heard.   I would like to know if there is any legal recourse she can take to offsett her loss of pay as a result of waiting for a comcast service representative who does not show up to rectify her service."
1,waiting aft 3rd call for low phone line aft storm yesterday
1,"I signed with Comcast in October/November 2007 with one year contract for Cable and internet services. When I called in early April to set my account for auto pay, I confirmed with the representative if I was still on the one year contract. The representative was nice to confirm. In late May/early June, I received the higher bill (more than double), when inquired, the customer representative told that his supervisor was not there and he will call me after few hours. After waiting three days, I called again but the customer service representative transferred me to different department and I spoke with Kim. According to Kim, he doesn't know; why my promotion was discontinued but he will call me after checking/looking into this. After waiting another few days, I called again and spoke with Susan; who promised me to call back but as of today, I have not heard anything and when I am trying to talk about this with any representative, they just transfer my call from one to another department. I would appreciate, if you please help me in resoloving this issue. There will be  economic damage if they will not give me promotion at this time since I missed other deals and I do call almost every other day which will be bad for my job/work production."
1,"I called comcast to set up cable after finding an authorized comcast dealer web site offering cable for 39.95 month with $75 cash back. Promo code 9299.  After talking to a rep for 30 minutes she went to this web site -- comcast's own website -- and said, Oh that's not offered in your area and tried to sell me the same service for 89.95 a month. This is outrageous. There is no choice. You cannot choose which channels you want.  They are a monopoly in our area and the prices just keep going up.  Where's the competition?  Why do they have the right to do this?  I've written to my senators but have heard nothing about regulating the cable companies."
1,"Comcast supplies our internet and cable television services. Our internet failed last night and we were promised they would arrive first thing this morning to fix it. When I called to confirm our appointment, they told me the tech would arrive in 45 minutes. It is now the evening and we have yet to see or hear from any technicians. I have been on the phone with Comcast all day, seriously, every 30 minutes I have called them and spoken with different people each time. They have assured me that Dispatch would be contacting me, but they didn't. They have assured me they have escalated my ticket. Unlikely. Each and every time we have called for service with Comcast, not just today, the technicians have cancelled our tickets claiming they arrived at my home and received no answer. I have been home each and every time there has been an appointment. We are in a situation where we cannot change cable/internet companies because Time Warner sold out to Comcast in our area. If we switch we will be out extra cash each month. And the speed cannot be equalled. We work from home and when our internet goes down, we lose money, both on a personal and a corporate level.  We get internet on our phones, but our clients will not accept having to wait for our responses."
1,"Canceled services because none of our promotional deals would transfer when we moved to another street in the same local area.  Took equipment to their location on Monday.  Guy at counter was extremely rude and behaved as if taking back Comcast's equipment was a huge imposition.  Called on Thursday to verify disconnect of service and they claim no proof of equipment turned in.  Receipt was buried in move, so called twice to request number to contact local office directly.  Once they hung up on me and another time told me there is no way to call them directly - I must drive out to the location.  Receipt was finally located, so I called again to give them the information.  First time, I was put on hold before she even asked my account number and the person never came back to the phone.  Hung up and called again and they tell me I still have to drive to the local office because they cannot verify my receipt over the phone.  Spent my entire lunch hour and the $4 per gallon gas to drive there.  They say it is now turned off, but I cannot call the 1-800 number to verify because they apparently all went to lunch and no one will answer the phones.I am filing this complaint in the hopes that others will see it and choose not to use Comcast.  If they are already involved, I hope they will read this and know to be absolutely certain that Comcast registers the return of equipment.  I would recommend calling the 1-800 number from their parking lot to ensure it is off before leaving the local office."
1,"Comcast has been down for the last 3 days. They want to blame it on the storm since it just happened yesterday. The worst thing about getting the 3 in 1 is that when one thing goes, it ALL goes. Even worst is you won't know you don't have telephone service unless you have a cell & someone contacts you on that and tells you your phone is not on. Comcast also has not hired staff to handle all these new accounts they are advertising for. So you are left waiting 5-6 days for someone to come out. I going back to  Verizon for phone service. Comcast should stick to cable and perfect that service. Too many companies trying to do things they know nothing about. Lastly, I want 3 days credit for no service' I'm calling about that now.You are left without phone, internet or tv; and if you have elderly people or young children it presents a very dangerous situation."
1,my hi speed internet from cast is getting slower and slower.  Just like my old dial up days! What can be done? 
1,   I have asked this company repeatedly to stop soliciting my home address. They have ignored my requests and continue to send internet/cable/phone offers to my home.  They will not stop sending solicitations to my residence though I have asked them to stop immediately.
1,"   On 6/6/08 I receive basic cable service with comcast. Before the tech AJ came out to connect my service i ask,how much my bill would be? he responded it cost me $25.00 to come out & connect & a monthly service charge on $24.95 for basic cable. After he left and i notice the order form, he did not check the box that shows how much my montly payment is or the service i should be receiving. I then call him and he said to me he was on the phone and he will call me back when he was through, I waited but he never called back, so I check the internet for comcast and got phone#. I called and got rep. Lemeka so i told her what happen and that i wanted to know exactly how much is my montly service charge becuase it only show $24.95 for 3montly. She started by saying there is a $50.00 credit fee,$29.00 connection and my bill will be $52 plus tax & other charges, I then ask to speak with a supervisor because I was never about these charges.The only charges i am aware of was that I needed to pay $25.00 which i did when the tech came out and my montly service for basic cable is $24.95. Lemeka the rep. said her supervisor Linda G was on a conference call & so I left a message on her vmail to call me asap. I then check the website & sent an email to Rick G (SVP Customer Operation Comcast). I then call back spoke with rep. Johanna was told a diferent story, I call the third time & spoke with rep Pam. I just was to know exactly how much my montly chages for basic cable & not a set of added and unnecessary charges.I called and got rep.

1,"   Since I signed up with Comcast 3 years ago. I have never been able to recieve all the channels I should be getting. It started with having to have 3 service people out the first day to install the digital box and internet. They left and it still was not working. It took a week for them to finally get it up and running. Only to break down again a week later. They have had the cable to the apartment replaced, They have replaced my converter box several times. When the system goes down it takes a week for them to come out and fix it but I have never recieved any credit. I am tired of paying for service I do not get. I live in an apartment and I am not allowed to have Direct tv installed.There has to be a way to stop this monopoly from doing what it is doing. Previous to this I actually moved out of comcasts area just to get away from them. Due to pressures of the commute I had to move back into there area. I have complained to the local ombudsman but they just gave the complaint to comcast and they did nothing about it. I hate this countries love of law suits but the more I deal with this company I can see that someone needs to put this company out of businessPrevious to this I actually moved out of comcasts area just to get away from them.

1,"Starting in the beginning of May 2008 my husband and I got divorced. We moved into a new house and the first thing we did was call comcast. They came out the first week of May and installed our tv and internet services. The gentleman was very nice and said we just needed to contact customer service to have the three email accounts on my ex husbands transferred over to our new account. Easy enough- that's what I thought. I contacted customer service right away and the Rep put in a ticket to have this completed. I called back a few days later to check and make sure it was completed and was told the ticket had been closed and the tech did not see any problems with us accessing our emails and they were working fine. I advised them that this was not the issue the ticket should have been opened for and that we we're just trying to transfer over our emails- we were not having any problem accessing them at all. The rep then put in a new ticket and told me it would now be entered correctly and completed within 48 hours. At this time customer service also contacted my ex husband to make sure his permission was granted for this to take place. On May 12th I called back to see what the status of the claim was. I was given some tired excuse and told that they would make it a priority so that it would be complete within 24 hours. I told them I would like a call back when this was completed to avoid any further time of mine wasted calling back in. On May 17th I still had not heard anything regarding the ticket and transfer of our email accounts and once again phoned comcast. This time I was told it was still pening and someone would be calling me on Monday. I never did receive this call and had to phone back in again on May 25th. This time I spoke with a Supervisor named Veronica/Ronnie. She looked into the issue a bit further and said the reason this was taking so long and still pending was because comcast had not received permission from my ex husband (which they already had at the beginning of the month). Rather than spend anymore time on the phone I said I would call him and have him call in to give his permission again. Ronnie said as soon as they spoke with him the issue would be taken care of within a few hours. My ex husband called and gave his permission. Later that day I still did not hear anything from Ronnie and called back. I was told she had left for the day and as far as this supervisor new it would take 24-48 hours to be completed now.I waited another week. On June 1st I had still not heard anything and called back. This time I spoke with a supervisor named James. After going over the problem for what seemed to be the thousandth time he said the reason nothing was being completed on this ticket now was because last weekend when they finally spoke with and got permission from my ex husband that the rep simply forgot to resubmit the ticket! He resubmitted the ticket and assured me this time that it had all the correct information, everyone's approval, and that it would be complete in 24-72 hours. He also reassured me and noted on the account again for whomever that completes this calls me to let me know it has been complete. Now here I am, it is June 8th. I still had not received a phone call and once again had to take time out of my day to call comcast. Today I spoke with a Sup named Greg. He advised me that this ticket is still waiting to be assigned for a tier 2 rep to complete. I told him that I thought it was an eslcated/emergeny flagged ticket and was to be completed immediately according to the past Supervisors. He confirmed this but could not give me any reason to why it has been 8 days and still it has not been assigned nor completed. He could not give me any time frame as to how long it will take for someone to get assigned to this or how much longer my ticket will have to be out in limbo. It doesn't seem to me that in any customer service enviorment that an eslcated issue should take 8 days or more to get resolved. I wouldn't have minded waiting the 8 days in the beginning, but considering we have already been dealing with this for the past month it seems a little rediculus that this cannot be made a priority. Everyone at comcast seems very good about putting the blame on the person who handled the situation before them and giving excuses, but no one seems able to do anything to fix the situation.

1,"Have been without cable TV for over 3 weeks now.  Have a few channels here and there but nothing we can watch with any consistency.  We have called many times starting 3 weeks ago.  We were originally told someone would be out on May 27.  Then no one showed up and we called again.  We were told we just didn't understand, they would not be coming until June 2.  The night of June 2 we called to find out what they were going to do to fix our cable.  They said they would not be out until the next day.  The next evening we called and got the same story.  Pretty much been the story since.  This week they did agree to give us a $100 credit on our bill, although our bill is $150 a month.  For the past 3 days I have been told that someone would be contacting the Maintenance dept and call me right back.  I have not had one call.  Sometimes I am on hold for over 45 min.  We have no television service and have been charged, lied to and have missed 3 days of work staying home waiting on service that never shows up."
1,"The Comcast 768K service absolutely tops out at 90K.  Period.  That's it. They intentionally limit speed to 90K, even though they advertise it as high speed.   My old ATT 768K DSL would go as high as 450K+ if the server had the capability.  Unable to continue at this pathetic speed and will have to pay AT&T over $200.00 installation to restore my DSL service."
1,"This company set up an scheduled appointment for me on 6-4-08 The tech was a no show. When I called I was told they would have the tech call me and he did to say sorry he wasnt given the equipment to do the job by his supervisor so he couldnt come!  That led to many more calls to Comcast and being put on hold repeatedly, being disconnected, and being given very inaccurate information about exactly when someone would be out. They then rescheduled a tech and didn't let us know by coutesy of a phone call or anything. I had to pay someone 30.00 to sit at the home waiting. Yesterday 170.00 was lost from work to stay home and wait. This doesn't include airtime charges incurred by being put on hold so much over the course of 2 days.They kept either disconnecting me today and giving me incorrect information regarding times and I don't know how this company is still is business. A class action lawsuit should be filed for all the monies lost by people being  left hanging waiting for no show techs and the customer service people lying to the consumers.monies lost from work to stay home and wait for installation, airtime charges being put on hold for long periods of time. having to pay people to saty at the home and wait so you dont miss anymore work."
1,Our Internet cable connection starts arcing every time there is a thunderstorm in the area. Blue and white sparks jumping on the cables. Called Comcast and they said it was a problem for an electrician as they ensure their cables are grounded. Our cable box coming into the house is not grounded. The Directv and phone box both have grounds (physical grounds). Comcast says it is not their fault.Got the heck shocked out of me when I touched the Internet cable coming into the house!
1,"I have been a customer of Time Warner/Comcast since 1988.  I have moved 3 times during Time Warner's reign in Shreveport and never had a minutes trouble.  On April 5, 2008 I moved from a house into an apartment complex.  I scheduled Comcast to come out on April 5th to hook up my service in my apartment (Digital Cable and High Speed Internet).  They sent a contractor who looked at my outlet and informed me that I was not getting a signal and he didn't know why so they would have to send out a Comcast Technician on Monday, April 7th.  I took the day off from work because they were supposed to be there between 8 and 5.  No one ever showed or called.  So I called them around 6 p.m. and was told they would have to send someone out on Wednesday, April 9th.  I took another day off from work just to be told that they would have to get into the apartment above me and the tenant was not home so they would have to reschedule.  They came out again on that Saturday, April 12th and still when they left I had no cable service.  Finally on Saturday, April 18th I got my outlet in my living room fixed so that I had my digital cable service.  They would have to come back to install my outlet for my high speed internet.  I waited to be contacted about my outlet and no one ever called.  Around the end of May I sent a complaint e-mail in on the Comcast website and someone contacted me to come out and look at installing my outlet.  The gentleman came out and said he would have to get in touch with the apartment complex and his supervisor to see how they were going to handle it.  He would call me the following day.  I'm not sure the dates here but I know it was the end of May.  He never called, so I again went to the Comcast website and sent another e-mail to customer service.  He called me 2 days later to inform me that his supervisor said they would not be installing my outlet for me.  I have been billed for internet service during all this time.  I have called customer service only to be told that I would have to pay the bill and then they would adjust it.  I have phoned the contact person that the apartment complex gave me his name is Lavell.  He was supposed to come out yesterday, June 3rd and see what he could do to get my outlet installed, but he never showed.  I have never dealt with a more unorganized group of people than what I have dealt with over the last couple of months with Comcast.  Where do I turn now?  They are still billing me for internet service and everytime I try to call to have my internet service disconnected they schedule an appointment to send someone else out.  Today I tried to login to my account online so I could send another complaint e-mail to them and they have shut-down my online access.  I can't check my e-mail, complain to them or anything.  Is there anyone who regulates these cable companies and how they treat their customers or do we have to just deal with it because they are the only show in town?  I know I don't have all the dates down that I missed work and I probably have left out some of the dates that they were at my apartment but I missed a total of fives days of work over this ordeal.Five missed days of work.  I don't want anything out of Comcast except for them to fix my outlet so I can have my high speed internet service and for them to adjust my bill for the time that I was out of service.  I currently have a $300 bill from Comcast and haven't had full service except my digital cable service from April 18th to today and my bill was paid in full when I moved."
1,"I live in a senior complex.  When Adelphia Cable was the main cable company, the seniors received a reasonable discount.  $10. for Basic and $15. for Standard.  Now with Comcast in, (with no competitors) we are at their mercy.  Seniors are paying the going prices.  But yet, another senior complex in the same town is being charged the discounts as described above. The seniors are on a fixed income, living in the State of Massachusetts with extremely high costs of living.  I call this discrimination. For $14.95, the seniors can get Basic cable, which consists mostly of home shopping channels, spanish speaking channels and local stuff.  The other senior complex is not even 1/2 mile from this one.  Comcast is a multi-million dollar outfit, but yet they are closing their eyes to being consistent with the seniors here in this town.  The mental anguish is enough!"
1,"About 18 mos ago we bought a HD television so that we could get a brighter clearer TV as my husband has failing eyesight.  We were told by Comcast that HD would come by Feb 2009.  Indeed it has come even sooner Jume 2008) and though it was advertised as being in our area it is NOT coming here.  It is NOT coming here ever. No one at Comcast can tell us why and we spent gobs of money for the TV set up for HD TV.  We are so angry because we have no other options to get HD for our TV.       The other aspect about Comcast is that their technical support and customer service is so bad we frequently have to spend half a day just to find out something as simple as You have no email because hackers got into our servers.  Then when the servers are fixed in some kind of ritualistic rotation, it finally gets to us 3 days after it gets to a town (Indiana, PA) 30 miles down the road.        The damage may be great as my husband was planning to use the TV as a very large screen for his writing. The other damage is psychological...Comcast clearly sees us living in a poor area and will not fund what is necessary to get HD up here yet we have a commerical account for a stable ISP address because of my work."
1,"   I am charged for movies we did not order. Comcast customer service operator told me on the phone that the movies were ordered with the remote control and that we had to have ordered them.  When I ask how come there was an event ordered on one tv but it showed it was on the box that we are having problems with? The rep said they couldn't answer that. My bill is $700. Comcast gave us a box without model or serial numbers on it and this is the same box where all these movies were ordered.  I have requested my past bills because I have been paying the bill with out an invoice, it has been about 3 weeks still no past bills."
1,"   We bought a new house in frederick, MD.  I understand it would take a little while for comcast to come out and hook up cable.  April 24 , 2008 contacted a general contractor for COMCAST ( a joke)he stated that he would be able to come out and hook me up real soon.  Never happended if fact will not call back and stated that it would probably take about 2 months to get hooked up.  APRIL 28, 2008 had a ticket or der since then and have been promised many time s to be contacted by supervisers but never have.  I have school and need internet to complete school.  I am very frustrated with the lie's and the promises.  I have tried direct TV but they cannot hook me up because of the way the house sits and where the grounding wire is.  So I have no choice but to go with COMCAST.  This really makes me upset."
1," My husband and I ordered the triple play package deal. Every thing was fine for two months, then for no reason we were disconnected from our service. We had to go to a pay phone and sit for an hour on three seperate occasions. We were lied to repeatedly about why we were shut off. One person actually told us that we called and told them to shut us off. Finally someone told us the truth. They made a mistake and shut us off for no reason, during which time they gave our phone number to someone else. We went for a week without service. Then finally a technician came and turned us back on. They told us we would not be charged for the reconnect fees or for the time we went without service. I was already mad and wanted to change services then so I called them and they reassured me that we would not be charged for those items. They told me I had been credited and at that time I owed them nothing, and that my next bill would be credited more and I would only have to pay $70.00. The very next day I recieved a bill for $38.00 that was behind and in danger of shut off. At this point I was tired of talking to them, so I decided to wait a couple of days before I called back again to complain TO my shock and horror, merely three days later, We received another bill. A bill for $264.79. we were in danger of being shut off. I looked at the bills (my previous two as well). I noticed that we were charged for the month of may three times. Also we were double charged for the voice on the last two bills. Also, not only did they charge us the re-connect fees, they charged us for new lines, technical supports.... totaling $158.00!!!!! Needless to say, all the technician did was flip a switch outside to turn us back on, none of these other services were done. I can not believe this. We got on the phone. This time they were very rude, and said that basically i didn't understand the bills correctly and we were not overcharged and we signed for the tech when he came out, so we can't prove that he didn't do all the stuff it said on the bill he did. So I asked him then, how did I go from owing nothing to oweing $38.00 the next day, then three days later over $250? How do these people stay in business? Isn't there any thing we can do? "
1,They scheduled three appointments in the same week to repair my cable reception and failed to show up for any of the three appointments.I do not have use of my cable tv
1,"I am so fed up with Comcast. We recently moved to a new house about 2 months ago. Our initial installation was a nightmare. The technincian installed the cable wire through the shower! They had to come back 3 more times to fix the cable, phones and internet. The last 2 bills I have received have been wrong and have taken me over an hour on the phone to straighten out. And they still weren't fixed! Not to mention, our phone didn't work the first 15 days. And when they finally came back to fix it, they unplugged our alarm system that was connected to the phone line. Consequently, our alarm company had to come back, charge us $100 to reconnect and Comcast will not reimburse us. On our last bill, we were charged again for Comcast coming back to fix the internet that never worked in the first place! Is this a joke? Horrible service!"
1,"I called on 5/30/08 to complain about overages, not returning calls, not responding to certified letters, I have never dealt with such poor customer service. I was on hold for 44 minutes finally had to call with another phone so someone could here I was still on hold aske to speak with a supervisor about my bill. I told my story then was told they were in tech service and could not help me. I am tired of poor service over billing not keeping scheduled service appopintments etc."
1,"   Comcast.net has been down - across the entire country for at least 16 hours with no end in site.  A tech told me that a server went down and ""they are rebuilding the site from scratch"". No one who uses Comcast email an access their mail. I'm waiting for an email on a job offer and I use email for 80 percent of my consulting business. This prevents me from working and damages my reputation with clients."
1,"   Comcast cancelled my service call with out notice. I had to call back 5 times to actually talk to someone. They kept transferring me and disconecting or hanging up. I called on Monday because my wireless router was not working. I called and went thru the name and address thing,reboot the router,reboot the computer with at least 4 different reps. Each time I would finnish doing all this they would transfer me and then disconnect or just plain old disconnect. I finally got someone who seemed to care and after she checked for any outages ect she put in a service ticket. Ticket numberCR125714229. I waited on Thursday and no one called and no one showed up. I have to work for a living, if I have to take off of work no one pays me. I call comcast 5 times on Thursday and they played the same game, transfer and disconnet. I finally got thru to Don signon  number 72899 and he said my service call was cancelled because there was an outage in my area. I told him they checked for any outages on Monday and there were none, an why would they schedule a service call if there was an outage and why didn't anyone call me back to tell me my service call was cancelled? I think comcast makes more promises than it can deliver on and just blows off their customers when they are busy. I am stuck because comcast is the only cable provider in my area. I have no choice but to buy their service. I am sending in a complaint to the Illinois commerce commision and also pettitioning  for a refferendum on the ballot here in Park Ridge to change the cable company that is allowed to do buisness.  I have been with out my E-mail and other internet functions such as banking, job functions ect because of the incompetent employees at comcast and their attitude that since they are the only provider we just have to take it. Well one person can make a difference and individuals have changed the course of history and governments. Comcast your days are numbered.

1,"   I called comcast in Feb-08 to cancell my service because the bill was just outrageous every month. I was told by the representative if I stayed with them and bundled my service they would discount my equipment and charge my $143.00 for a period of 12 months. The next month I called back because my bill was still incorrect, I spoke to another representative who told my the computer was wrong and had not been updated, but don't worry I only owed $50.00 that month. Now we are in May and my bill is still wrong, I called back and was told there was no way my service would cost $143.00 and there was nothing they would or could do about it. I asked to speak to Supervisor, when Sharon got on the line she looked at my account and told me even though her representatives misquoted me, there was nothing she could do and they would not honor the price they gave me. After speaking with her for about fifteen minutes she continued to acknowledge they made a mistake, but would not live up to their end of the bargain. This falls under the idea of Bait-and-Switch. I am disgusted a company would try to use these juvenile tactics to mislead their customers,I will now look into Direct Tv. I have been a customer with comcast for 6 years, and it amazes me they do not care if they lose me as a customer or not.  The financial drain on me to find new service and have it installed is not only due to the service but also to the time needed to research and decide on a new plan. Also my home business will suffer because the email address will have to change as well as the service interruption.

1,Comcast just took over from my old cable company Patriot Media.  All I can say is how disappointed I am with the Comcast way of doing business.  It took over an hour to pay a bill.  I give them a very bad rating.  Too bad I cannot get Fiber in my area.  The most disappointing thing is they just dont care.I want my hour of time back.
1,"During the almost eight years that we had Adelphia, we rarely had any problems, except maybe once or twice with bought movies, and even then when we called, they fixed the  problem, apologized and NEVER charged our account more then once for the movie. However as soon as Comcast took over, the problems were non stop. Bought movies would cut out, have audio but no video, video but no audio, bad picture reception, you name it. TV shows had the same thing happen to them. Internet would randomly die, kick us off claiming no service even if it said we had full strength, and sometimes it wouldn't even let us connect. And whenever we called to complain they were extremely unhelpful, ALWAYS charged us twice and technicians rarely were able to help us."
1, i called back and let my husband call and spoke to someone in english. they fixed the problem in 5 minutes and it wqs real simple. this is not the first time with them. they hire people that dont know what they are doing. after all of this they only gave me a 5.00 credit on my bill.
1,Every month my bill has been wrong.  Then my service went down for a long time about a month.  They had credited me.  During the time my service was down they had 3 technicians come out and try to hook up the modem with no luck and left without any of my service working. Then a fourth supervisor tech came out with no luck.  Finally a month and a half later a guy at comcast fixed it on the phone.  We called comcast to ask what the bill would be with our credit.They said $87.00 we went in and paid.not to go back to the beginning but they were double billing me and admitted to it in 2007 for internet for 7 months.  So then we get a $400 bill saying our service was going to be shut off and there was nothing we could do because we were late since december which is not true.  Everyone I talk to is telling me the same thing but I know it is not true.  They make you feel helpless.  My wife would be the contact call her at the home number she can give you all the info.  Please help.  Mu bill should only be $165 to $175. It has never been right since we signed up with them. I want an attorney to contact me.The result is that I will be out almost $500 for no reason.  Please help

1,"On May 1st, a Comcast technician was scheduled to arrive sometime between 3-7pm at my new apartment I was moving into.  They called and said the technician would be late.  After a difficult conversation as to what should be done, I told them to have the technician call me and tell me when he would be able to make it, or if he wouldnt make it at all.  So the technician or a representative called back around 7pm and said that the technician would not be able to do the installation and asked if I wanted to reschedule.  At that time I was upset that they didnt uphold their end of the deal and I told them I may not reschedule, I had to think about it.  The next day a woman from Comcast called me and stated that if I called her back at her 1-800 number and her extension, that she would do the free installation for me.  I called her on a Sunday and she was not available.  No big deal I thought, Ill just call another representative, its just a internet installation and this type of deal should be pretty common, installation guys Im sure dont make it to all their appointments every time they are scheduled so this free offer must be procedure.  During her message to me, she simply stated that I could call her back, not at what time or whether I needed to speak directly to her to get the deal.  So I called the regular Comcast number and I told the representative that I was offered the free deal and wanted to schedule it.  So they did set up a time, and also guaranteed that I would only pay $29.99 for the next 6 months.  So I thought that was even better.  Then after that, everything went as planned.  The technicians showed up on May 6th and did the installation.  I mentioned to them how it was great that I missed the first guy and these guys were doing it for free.  They simply agreed.  I signed the paper and off they went when the installation was done.  I signed the paper to show that the guys did their work.  There is was no verbal discussion or any written agreement to be held to the charges on the paper I might add.  The paper simply states that the work has been done where the person signs.  Balance due: $0.   I thought it was free, and I have my internet and I can continue on with my life.  But, on May 21st I received the first bill stating I owe $94.79! For sure this must be a mistake.  I know the culprit was the installation charges and it was.  I was mad but felt assured that Comcast would just go ahead and make the changes and fix it.  I called and was transferred 3 times, told my story 3 times and in the end I was being blamed for not having the womans name or number who mentioned the deal.  I told them that the piece of paper and the voicemail was discarded a long time ago; this phone call was made 17 days ago.  I explained to them that this must be a procedure and a refund was in order.  They demanded proof that I was given permission for this free installation and needed to show proof in order to get the refund.  I spoke to a manager but he gave me the runaroundabout 15 times.They said there was nothing they could do, but there were two customer service representatives, and a managers approval to give me the free installation that were involved in the transaction, along with the installers.  But there was no way to trace it and nobody there made note of it.  How convenient for them.   They gave me advice, Make sure you save that name and number next time someone gives you a promotion.   If I call and cancel Im still stuck with a $94.79 bill. I would have never agreed to it if I was going to be charged the installation fee because Im in Detroit now and here we have the most internet service providers in the state here, which means the most competition.  I hold a bachelors from Michigan State University in telecommunications, I should know.  I also work in the telecommunications industry.   For the resolution: I hope someone can make these guys pay, they owe me and other consumers who have been treated the same.  Its less about the money than it is about good business practices and holding businesses accountable when they purposely have systems and policies in place that harm the consumer.Loss of $59.95, one hour defending myself over the phone, telephone minutes I wasted, and of course, frustration."
1,"Ordered internet and cable service through BuyComcast.com because of $175 in rebates.  After 6 months and multiple phone calls, they now claim that I cancelled that order and reordered directly through Comcast and am not eligible for rebate.  I have an order confirmation number from BuyComcast.com, someone called me, set an appt time and a technician installed the service, the acct is in good standing.  I chose Comcast over satellite because of this rebate offer, now they don't want to honor it.I'm owed the $175 that enticed me to choose Comcast vs a satellite service.  Not to even mention the several hours spent on the phone."
1,"Comcast relegated the NFL network to an add-on package. This was not disclosed when we initiated service - it is common knowledge that NFL network is part of regular digital pkgs.  Time and expense of researching, canceling, and re-subscribing w. a more forthright company. General displeasure with their deceit and greed."
1,"Signal degradation and intermittent signal breaks caused me to have a service call. The technician came out and did not replace my router because he didn't have any with him. He suggested I hard reset my router and if that didn't work buy a new router. I reset it and everything was fine for a weekend and then starting monday morning the signal degradation started again and i was getting kicked off the network as before. I bought and paid to have professionally installed a new router. I experienced the same problem with the signal strength. Comcast's response to this was that they only guarantee a hard wire signal from the modem to a desktop/laptop. They offer no guarantee of service through a router. I spoke to neighbors who noticed the same problems and had service calls as well replacing their modem but continuing to has a slow signal and frequent disconnects. Finally today I signed up for business service for $89.99 per month in the hope that it will restore the signal I used to enjoy until 3 weeks ago.$200 new router, $260 installation, 2 hours online troubleshooting the new router in the event it was the problem. The old router was less than 1 year old. $89 2 year contract for business service. "
1,"I signed up for a promotion that Comcast was advertising on television called comcast blast. Which was advertised simply as high speed internet for 6 months at $24.99. However, I am being billed at a rate of $65.99. My service has been spotty, the first month I was without internet for 11 days. I have spoken to numerous customer service representatives who told me that there was no such deal being offered. I found proof of the offer and presented it to them and they still refused to honor it. My husband cancelled the service and returned the equipment and was told that in order to recieve the deal we needed to subscribe to at least basic cable television. When he inquired as to why we were not made aware of this when initially requesting the service the rep. replied everyone knows that its on your contract. We never recieved a contract and had know paperwork stating any such facts. Several days later an independent marketing representative for comcast contacted us and offered us a different deal. Again we singed up but never recieved the deal that was offered. After numerous phone calls and lost time someone finally agreed to honor the commitment. However, when the next bill arrived in the mail it was back to $65.99. "
1,"I was supposed to have my phone and internet installed on 4/26; the tech came and left because he did not have a cable long enough to run the service, he promissed me that he was coming back. I waited for few days, called back and on May 2nd a second tech showed up, after 2 hours of his departure my phone and my internet were dead, called again and they fix it over the phone, worked for 2 days and died again (no phone, no internet), called again, they wanted to set up an appointment for Sunday, May 11 to change the modem because, as per their support,it was bad, I asked them to come on Saturday since Sunday was mother's day, they agreed, they did not showed up on Saturday and did showed up on Sunday, the tech that came did not know that he had to change the modem, he left with out fixing the issue and leaving the modem disasembled. I called again and they tell told me that they were setting up another appointment for Wednesday but no one needed to be at home because the problem was with the outside line. what about the modem that was left in parts. then they agreed that they will be coming back between 11 and 2 to fix everything; I always need to make arrangements to wait for the techs since we all work so we loose working time, this time, my sister is visiting from overseas and has to stay home waiting for them to show up. I am not mentioning the times that I called besides the ones that I was able to talk to one of the so call Customer Service Rep and  the 3 times that I asked to talk to a supervisor and was put on hold because he/she was taking care of a customer (what am I?) and never picked the phone up. Their service is the worse that I ever had. I will not recomend it at all.    I lost hours at work for the appointments, hours on the cell phone talking to Customer Service reps, stress and frustration because they are rude and no one knows what the other one is doing and on top of everything I got a bill from 4/24/ to 5/21 when I never got the service"
1,"A Comcast sales rep came by my house and offered me a sepcial cable package to upgrade my cable and add digital voice for a total pkg of 65.99usd. Installation was set for Mar 11th but due to installation issues did not happen until mar 19th. My first bill came  3/27-4/26 $209.05.  My second bill 4/27-5/26 $165.84. I refused to pay those bills, requested adjustments, which never happend, was sent to a service center to show them my contract, which I did. They looked at it, made a copy and sent me back to billing, who said that they refer this to special department, takes 2-3business days. Also gave me a phone number of Sales mgr for my area, whom I left several messages with, but never received a call back. My phone is cut of for 3weeks and my cable service is basic, basic cable only. Comcast is telling me they will cut of my service completeley , if I don't pay the $419.99 for the 2 month I had the special ($65.99) package deal.   WHAT A  DEAL , NO ORDEAL THAT IS."
1,"I have had so many problems with Comcast, it has pretty much been a joke.  But..I have always felt when dealing with them, they were TRYING to remedy the situation until now. A few weeks ago I attempted to record a program with my HD DVR from Comcast. It appeared like it was setup, but when I went to watch the program, I got a message that said this service was disabled.  I called Comcast, spent about an hour and a half on the phone with a very nice customer service rep, who said I basically did not have the DVR service.  I am a NEW customer as of this January 08 and I HAVE USED the DVR service several times to record programming that I would watch at a later date..so I DID HAVE the service. He finally transferred me to a manager who agreed that for some reason it had been disabled.  She confirmed that it WAS part of the Triple Play Package that I originally purchased and YES I should have it.  Said she was transferring me and when I was prompted for the retention department to choose it.  Where ever I was transferred to never had a prompt for the retention department and I am back at the same place I was when I first called.  I explain the situation, but basically start the ENTIRE Process over again..I tell them I have now been on the phone for nearly two+ hours and my patience is getting very short.  The rep tells me she needs to talk to her manager and will call me back shortly.. I am still waiting for that call and it has been 10 Days. Can someone please turn my DVR service back on..Just frustration with Comcast and the loss of many hours of time trying to resolve this issue along with MANY others.."
1,"I signed up for the Triple Play approximately 11 months ago.  The service has been spotty, but I've learned to deal with it.  My family and I recently moved and requested a service transfer to our new address.  That is when the real problems started to occur.  First, it took three separate technicians on three separate dates to come out before we finally got service, and even then we only had cable service working--no phone or Internet.  The phone and Internet were eventually fixed days later.  Shortly after, we were out of Internet for a week.  Now, they have sent me a bill for nearly twice what I normally pay, stating that they are billing upfront and for previous service.  Well, through some investigation on my part I found out they don't even have the billing codes right in the first place.  Not only that, but thay haven't credited me for the prior months payment I sent in, which of course they deposited into their Bank of America account.  So, in essence, they are double billing AND overcharging.  The first call I made to straighten their mess out was on April 29, 2008.  I was on the phone with them for over 30 minutes.  Further complicating matters was the fact that the CSR couldn't grasp the basic concepts of elementary math.  So, he said he'd tranfser me to his supervisor.  The supervisor never got on the phone.  The CSR then came back on the line and said the supervisor would have to call me back.  I gave my contact number but never got a call or message.  Wondering whjat happened, I called again and was told the supervisor would be getting with me shortly.  Again, I got no call.  On May 13, 2008 at 9:44 a.m., I called Comcast once again and got a female CSR this time.  I re-told her the dilemma.  After the standard question and answer session, she said she was transferring me to her supervisor--this was at 9:50 a.m.  I was left on hold until 10:05 a.m. when I eventually hung up, effecting a 21-minute phone call that yielded no results.  I immediately called back again at 10:05 a.m.  This time I got a CSR named Al.  I instructed Al to skip all the meaningless chit-chat and patch me through to his supervisor.  He then proceeded to ramble through the standard questions, account verifications, and other stalling techniques.  I told him again to put me through to someone who could actually do something about my situation, preferably someone with a pulse and an IQ above 80.  He told me to hold while he got his supervisor.  He then got back on the line and said the supervisor was unavailable.  He asked for my contact phone number, so this supposed supervisor could call me back.  I gave him the same number as before, ending the conversation at 10:10 a.m.  I still haven't heard from Comcast.I have suffered emotional distress and lost countless hours of my personal time dealing with Comcast's account errors, fraudulent billing techniques, inconsistent service, and general incompetency.  I am also out nearly $200 and have been subjected to a possible service disconnection and credit ding because of my refusal to send them more money, just as they refuse to credit my account with the money I have already sent them (they pre-bill).  Something needs to be done.  In the meantime, I will just switch to satellite and DSL."
1,"I was a comcasy customer, I was paying my bill on time I had a credit of 40 something dollars. My husband called me and told me that the internet was down so I called comcast to let them know. When I called me phone call was sent to account services because they said that it was a past due balance of 485.00 I said there is no way. Some one had called into to comcast and the money was reversed on my account, but they didnt have no details to why and how, Well come to find out that my ex called comcast and got my address as well as the payments that had been made to comcast. They ask that I fax in a copy of my bank statements and they would credit the account back, after faxing the bank statement to them twice they still have not credited my account back, and still have a balance of 400 and something dollars. Not only that they gave out my address to him and he is not to come near me or call me. A customer service rep said it had to be a inside job, and you should get your money back but they have yet to give it back. Also when we frist ordered service the guy that came out was rude he said that he did not have time to look for a connection and besides he was late. I told him to leave and I called for a nother guy to be sent out. Well they guy they sent out complained about hooking up as well. My husband got on his knees and do most of the work for him. I have stopped using comcast and would never use comcast again. What about the Hippa law they told me they dont use the hippa law they have there own law and hung up on me. I have had to move because they gave out information to some one that has physical hurt me and my children, and that has called every day since he got the number and address. We also have had to have our number changed."
1,"ABSOLUTE HORRIBLE Comcast customer service in Chicago My Comcast cable goes out every 3 weeks - like clockwork.  This has been going on since January 2008.  It is now early May 2008.  When I go into the Main Menu -> Cable Setup -> Display, it shows Disconnected - Not Connected. I tried to explain this to Comcast and was told my cable is out because the box was physically disconnected and I needed to re-connect the box.  What ?  If the box was disconnected, how am I able to go inside the Cable Main Menu and read this to them?  This proved that Comcast knows NOTHING about their equipment nor how it's works.  I have called Comcast easily over a dozen times and what do/did I get: 1) Hung-up on. 2) Techs no-call, no-show. 3) Lied to - Repeatedly by Comcast about the scheduled day/time when the tech was suppose to arrive.  This part is really really bad and apparently legendary.  Countless times I was told that a tech will to arrive between 8 & noon or between 1 & 5PM and like an idiot, I waited - and waited - and waited - and waited.  Called Comcast, like every hour to check on my scheduled appointment: no clue, I mean totally clueless - hugh waste of time.  I was told they have no control over dispatches.  And yet, you have to contact them to schedule a dispatch.  4) Techs, if and/or when they do show up, have absolutely no clue on what is the problem and apparently why they were dispatched - I guess they are told to just show up. 5) And most importantly, tech not fixing the problem as my cable went out Tuesday, May 06 and is still out.  The few and I do mean few techs that did show up told me the following: the problem is with the signal - the problem is not with the signal - the problem is outside - the problem is inside - when this happens, to call Comcast and have them send an INT signal to the boxes.  This is like wiping out and re-sending the cable box configs any Favorite Cable Channels settings are gone.  But you have to beg and plead with Comcast to do this and this is a TEMPORARY FIX.  A few weeks later, cable goes out.  Another tech told me directly to -my -face to call Comcast and cancel the service as this would get their attention to fix the problem.  I could not believe a Comcast tech was telling me to do this.  At others times I was told that the tech would come out and replace both HD cable boxes.  Techs, again the few that did show up, were empty-handed - no replacement cable boxes.  Techs did not know what I was talking about when I asked where were the new boxes.  Comcast told me that they were sending out a tech to replace the boxes.  Their reply was they were not sent to replace anything - and then asked, once again, what is the problem?   It is as if for the past 5 months, I have been talking to an empty phone in an empty room.  Again, tech shows up with no clue on the reason they were dispatched - they just show up - and even that's a maybe - they may show up or they may not.  No one knows.  I have been in the customer support field for over 10 years with many different companies and have NEVER seen such BAD service as Comcast.  It is as if they are deaf, dumb and blind to the ability of providing SERVICE to their CUSTOMER.  Isn't that what they are suppose to do ??  Customer Service means giving Service to the Customer.  Where is the follow-up call to the customer to confirm that they are back up and working?  Where is the call to the customer to let them know the tech is running a little late?  Or cannot make the scheduled appointment?  Why do I, the customer have to call the provider to find out what is going on?  What is needed is another cable provider in Chicago.  I will take ANYONE/ANYTHING over Comcast,  I wish I could get satellite service, but I live in a condo that faces East. For satellite service, like Direct TV, I need to have an unobstructed view of the southwest sky.Apparently I am left with no choice but to cancel service as the cable goes out at will with no fix and no cares/concerns from Comcast.  None at all.  I pray to God in Heaven to please let Verizon FIOS, RCN, WOW-Wide Open West, or ANYONE get in my area and provide cable television service - and FAST!"
1,"ive been calling about a dangerous electrical amplifier that has been wiyhout a cover for a year.then 3 weeks ago comcast ran a cable wire across my yard from corner to corner. i called comcast 7 times about the open electrical box, still no one came out. i called may 5,2008 was told they would be out may 6 , 2008 no show .i called may 8 2008 was told they would be out may 9 2008 no show. i called may 9 2008 talked to a supervisor michael id# mas. thats all he would give me. i explained about the wire accross my yard, and the saftey hazzard with the open amplifier . i told him my grandchildren play in the yard and it could be dangerous. his answer was to keep the kids out of there oun yard. not comcasts yard but my yard. he said they would be out in 2 weeks"
1,"We signed up for a basic cable and Internet package when we first moved to East Boston. Because we are in East Boston we HAD NO CHOICE of a provider. Comcast sent us a modem that kept working poorly, shutting off, and disconnecting. I contacted customer service twice about the problem--the first time they told me I had to increase my plan to get a better modem. The second person actually told me that I had a poorly made, out of date modem. My boyfriend took the modem back to a Comcast agent at a location. He said he waited in a long line full of angry customers, most returning faulty modems. The rep was not helpful, and rude in fact. We purchased our own modem, for $80, and not it works fine. Needless to say, our first four months of service was at a cost, for shoddy service. They refused to give us any money back or reduce the bill. I can't wait until we get another provider in the area, or move.$80 for new modem, $12 in fees, and additional wasted time on the telephone (phone bill costs)- 3 hours or so."
1,"3 months ago, I signed up for Comcast Tripple play (cable, internet and digital voice) at a special promotional price through a third party vendor, Anderson. Anderson had a kiosk in Walmart, north Little Rock and persuaded me to sign up for this deal. As per the deal, I was going to pay $70 per month for this package in the first 6 months followed by their regular price of $99 per month for the triple play package. There was a promise of repayment of $350 by check through coupons. The package also included free subscription to premier channels (such as HBO) and HD channels for 1 year. Anderson took my details and gave me a confirmation number saying some one will contact me from Comcast in the next couple of days. Two days later I got a call from Comcast enquiring the time to establish the service. During this conversation, it became apparent that the caller was not aware of the special promotional package and was trying to sell me with the regular price of $99 per month. I refused to accept this offer and mentioned about the offer being sold by Anderson. A couple of days later, I got a call from Ms Kathy Greenbaum as well as a representative from Anderson. The Anderson rep told me that the package they offered me holds good and Comcast should honor it. However Ms Greenbaum told me that there was some miscommunication between Comcast and Anderson with regards to pricing. After much deliberations over the next 2 days, she called me back on my cell phone and offered me the same package at a revised price at $82.50 per month for six months followed by regular price of $99 per month. Local Comcast technician came and installed the equipments in the next 2-3 days. I had multiple interruptions with my internet connection for which I called Comcast customer services. This issue is not completely resolved. In the meantime, I noticed that I was charged more when I received my first month's bill. I tried to bring to Comcast's attention about the descrepancy in the monthly invoice and the special package I was promised. I sent them an e-mail about 3 months ago, and have made at least 4 different calls to Comcast customer service on this matter. Once it was a Saturday. As the local office was closed, the call handler told that he will pass on my issue to the concerned persons in the local office. He promised that some one from Little Rock Comcast office would call me on the following Monday. As no body called me over the next 2-3 weeks, I made another call to their call center and spoke to one named Steve. He expressed his inability to help me as it was a matter for the local office and transferred my call to Ms Kathy Greenbaum in Little Rock. She was not available in her office and I left a message on her voice mail explaining my situation clearly. This happened on March 31st, 2008. However, I did not hear from her at all. As I was having no luck and was wasting a lot of time on the telephone, for the following billing cycle, I just paid $82.50. In the first week of May (1-9), I was on a vacation. When I returned home on 5/9/08, I was surprised to see that my Comcast service (telephone, internet and television all three) were disconnected. I called them again on 4 different occasions on May 9th and spoke to Mr Jonathan Ross, Ben and Sherry. I spent more than 2 hours on the telephone. They told me that there was an unpaid balance for $92 for which, my service was disconnected. When I explained the situation again - about my previous attempts to contact them and the promotional package - Mr Ross and Ben promised to call me within few minutes. They never returned the call. Mr Ross had given me his direct telephone number which was on voice mail. He did not respond to my message left on the voice mail. Later in the evening, I paid the amount for $92.50 when I spoke to Sherry as they were not prepared to restore my service until I paid.1) I have suffered economic damage a) because of inflated price and b) because of wastage of my time spent on telephone 2) Psychological stress due to the feeling of being cheated by Comcast"
1,"I cancelled my cable TV on 4/24/08.  I contacted customer service after receiving my bill with the cable TV charge still on it.  I was informed that it is standard procedure to bill customers for an extra month after they cancel their service.  At no time was I informed of this BEFORE I started service with them. I will be paying for cable TV until June, even though it was disconnected almost 2 weeks ago.  I cancelled because I did not want to pay full price after being told when I wanted to cancel my service previously that my package pricing of TV and internet would be extended for another 6 months to keep me from cancelling.  The next bill I got was at full price, and when I contacted them about this, I was told that I was lied to and that I had to pay full price.I am paying $55.45 for absolutely nothing, in addition to the $34.40 I have already paid because I trusted that they would extend the package pricing as promised."
1,I ordered service through comcast which included cable tv and internet at a price of 66 dollars for the package...I had to order a modem at a one time price of $50.00 plus tax which I gave them my credit card information to charge it on there..Then I was directed by there sales team to the installation department which informed me that service is not available in my area.I then asked them how do I stop this order from taking place? They informed me that I would need to talk to they sales department and get them to cancel it..So I get directed back to them and at that point they say they have no record of my name phone number or address in their system....So a day later I checked my account in sure enough it has been charged a fee by comcast...I call them back in still no record of me ordering service through them.The loss of about 65.00 dollars and they endless amount of time I spent on the phone with these people who continually put me on hold to give me no answers of why they can't find me in their system..
1,"Asked for installation and they caused damage. After over a week trying to have them come out to fix, they finally came to resolve.  During this whole time the comcast people have agreed that some new wiring needs to be put in to have the correct service and they still haven't sent anyone out. Call, after call, does not produce a result.  I could go on and on, I just want the service I am paying for.I waited for a service tech on a Friday evening wherein service was promised no later than 8 p.m......no one showed.  The attic ladder they broke was left open for almost a week during winter months before someone came out and fixed it.   Much time spent calling and calling and getting redirected to someone else, over and over and over.  Total adjustment after all was said and done ---- $20."
1,"Every month I get a bill with no due date. It will say billed from 4/23-5/23 but do due date. When I call comcast, I get several different responses. Sometimes, I get the 3rd of the month, or other times, I get the 14th of the month. Which one is it? Well, aside from that due to me only getting paid once a month, my bill to them is always past due. So then I am stuck with a $7.00 late charge fee. It use to be $5.00. I don't know when they changed it to $7.00, because I was never notified in any of the billing statements. I have never know anyone to charge for your payment being late, especially not that much. $7.00 is alot of money, for being a couple of days past due...do they not realize that things do come up, and sometimes, like with me only getting paid once a month, I usually miss my due date. They are always raising the prices for their crappy service. Thank God, I only use their internet! I would NEVER use them for anything else. With everything being so high from groceries to gas, it is ridiculous to charge $7.00 just because your payment is late. Is there anything legal we as a people can do to stop these money hungry giants? This should be considered stealing money from those that support comcast through having their services. It's just ridiculous."
1,"I had set my TiVo to record Globe Trekker, for the episode including Iran. Guess what happened? ONE HOUR OF BLACKED-OUT PROGRAMMING!GREAT IDEA, COMRAD-CAST!I was unable to watch the episode I was looking forward to viewing. Why should Comcast use their prehistoric political angles to keep me from watching a program that encourages viewers to get along with the rest of the world?! There has to be a legal precedent involved in this kind of instance."
1,"Comcast came to house and switched us over  to their all in one (phone/internet/cable) package. This complaint is about the internet. Since their install, our virus protection and other programs cannot go online for updates. Calls to their tech support result in either being put on hold and then the call dropped (3X), or not understanding the problem at all. Finally a tech stayed with the call and after wasting 15 minutes, said he would write up a ticket for a tech to handle it, which would take up to 72 BUSINESS hours (today is Friday.). I thought I was ALREADY talking to a tech, but evidently the people they use on the first line of customer service (if you can call it that) really are not equipped to do much. One can sense this by their general cluelessness and frequent inability to retain a phone call. If this is any indication, COMCAST hi speed internet maintains one of the worst tech support centers I have encountered anywhere. The bottom line is that their installation screwed up our computer and they dont seem in any rush whatsoever to make it right... they have their upfront installation fee and the customer be damned. Consumers BEWARE!Without virus protection or online backup until this is resolved, and judging from their support I doubt they will resolve it anytime soon."
1,"We've had constant problems with Comcast since they took over our cable service from Insight.  We had autopay set up with Insight which we were told would transition over to Comcast.  That clearly did not happen.    A month or so later we suddenly lost service.  When we contacted Comcast we were told we lost service because of nonpayment.  Comcast hadn't properly set up or transferred the autopay provisions.  After 2+ hours on the phone with various Comcast service represenatives Comcast restored our cable and internet service and set up the autopay.  Tuesday we again had our service shutoff for nonpayment even though Comcast had assured us the account had been rectified and autopay set up.  Again we spent 2-3 hours on the phone with Comcast trying to get the situation straightened out.  Once again Comcast assures the problem with the account and autopay has been corrected, but we're left wondering whether we get to look forward to another 2-3 hours on the phone with Comcast at the end of May.  The height of irony is that in the middle of the hours on the phone the other night, another employee from Comcast called to see how things had worked out after our call two months ago.  Needless to say, we're angry and looking into alternatives for internet access and TV."
1,"i have a problem with comcast cable co,i have been overcharged with cable,i called them to correct bill they said they would ckeck problem,i just paid bill ,174,00 the next day they shut off service,then they said they would turn it back on for another 236.00,i gave them 410.00 dollars that month, this month i get another bill this month for 393.89 dollars, a couple of months ago i signed a contract for 159 00 a month,but bill has never beencharged that amount.this problem has been going on for years,i have call this company several times, spoke to there supervisors, but nothing has been corrected,if you dont pay ,they shut you down,this is terrible that they can do what ever they want,i tried calling there corperate but i could not get throught, please hele me with this problem. thank you"
1,"I subscribed to Comcast bundled package (cable TV, Internet, Phone) in Feb. 2003 with a 24 month contract. Since that time I have had problems with the internet and phone service.  I have a record on file with Comcast of problems and visits by technicans dating back to Feb. 15, 2007.  The problem still exits.  A technican was her again today and internet service dropped several hours after he left.  I want out of this contract without penalty.  My husband and I both work from home offices with calls being dropped and no email service costing us business."
1,"Since COMCAST took over Adelphia Cable in the Frederick, Md area the quality of the cable picture has deteriorated 99%. The video signal is crap! You call in a trouble and if you ever do get someone, which usually takes 15-45 minutes, the canned answer is you are the only one in your area experiencing the trouble. And if your neighbors are experiencing the problem and dont call in COMCAST does nothing BUT they will send out a tech 1, 2, 7 days later to check and leave a nastygram on your door sayinh you missed your service appointment when one was never made. I have dealt with Comcast in everypart of Maryland and they have not changed. Lousy, lousy video quality and even lousier Customer Service.Video quality is sub-par and I work for a major communications utility in the broadcast video installation and service market."
1,"I have Comcast internet and have been very happy with the service until they changed their website.  Now, when I try to access my email via the website, I am able to see some of the messages until I receive an error message saying Login Failed.  This originally happened once or twice each week. Now it happens almost every time I check my email!  I have called Comcast repeatedly and every time they tell me to change my password.  This works for an hour or two and then I begin getting this error message again.  They are either complete idiots and have no idea what's going on with their system or they do know but don't want their customers to know this.  I am getting very frustrated with the lack of an effective response from Comcast but they seem to have the high speed internet market all wrapped up.I use my email for work so I cannot respond to my clients in a timely manner when this happens.  Also I have spent endless hours on the phone with Comcast but their so-called fixes don't work for very long."
1,"Due to the recent acquisition of Patriot Media, I am now a Comcast customer...and a very unhappy one at that.  I have now been without telephone service for one week and, less importantly, internet for three days.  After multiple calls to Comcast during the first days of the telephone outage, my husband and I were told some of the following things:  There are only certain call centers who are handling your area, but you cannot speak to them.  Please hold while I talk to them about your problem.  Can't you just use your cell phone?  You were not entered in our database prior to the switch-over of service.  The problem is with your modem.  The problem is on our end with the communication between our system and your modem.  There is nothing I can do to help you.  You will have to wait for a call back to schedule a service call since you are not in our computer.  And, as of today, someone who was probably the most honest yet:  If we cannot figure out the problem, we will not be able to provide telephone service to you.  Ok, so I get that there are growing pains with any merger/acquisition, but this is ridiculous.  If Comcast could not handle the customers of Patriot Media, they should NEVER have taken over the company.  So, when we first started calling, they kept telling us that we couldn't be scheduled for a service call because we weren't in their database.  But they opened a ticket and would have someone from the designated call center give us a call to set up a time.  The call-back never happened.  So, my husband and I took turns multiple times a day calling them back to get someone to do something productive.  We kept hearing the same thing about the call center and they couldn't help us (blah, blah, blah), and then I decided to search Comcast's website for a complaint email address.  I found one for the VP of customer service.  I'm no idiot, so I know it's a general mailbox, but within two hours of submitting the email I received a call from the corporate office in Princeton, NJ.  The woman was very nice to me, but ultimately, couldn't help me.  She DID, however, schedule a service call for Sunday morning.  The tech came, replaced the modem, but couldn't get the phone to work because the tech in the office was too busy to put our new modem info into the database while the other tech was still in our house.  I knew that was trouble.    So, here we are...7 days and counting with no phone, and 3 days without internet.  So, I called this morning and immediately asked the customer service rep. for her supervisor.  I got one, and asked him if Comcast even knew what the underlying problem was.  He admitted that they do not, and if they can't figure it out, they're just not going to be able to provide phone service to us.  WOW!  So, because Comcast bought our cable company, and we were forced to switch to their service, and there are now major problems that they can't figure out, my family is just supposed to accept the fact that we may not be able to have our phone through the cable company anymore.  So, if that happens, Comcast will just raise the rates of the cable because we can't have the triple package.    I don't think I have ever dealt with a company as inept and unethical as Comcast.  If you do have a choice for your cable, internet, and/or phone, DON'T CHOOSE COMCAST. Most importanly, my family has had no access to 911.  Also, I work from home two days a week to save on gas and mileage.  Now that I have no phone or internet, I can't do that.  Also, the emotional stress that my husband and I have been under just trying to get our phone restored has been daunting.  The attitude that Comcast has taken (We bought your cable company, your phone doesn't work, there's nothing we can do to figure out the problem, so tough) is appalling."
1,"Unfortately I am writing to inform you of by bad experience with Comcast.  It all started on 4/12/08 when I called Comcast to have our line checked out.  For the past couple of months we were losing our cable as we use it for VOIP with AT&T and Comcast for High speed for our computer.  I called on this day 4/12 to explain what was happening and Comcast immediately sent a tech out to the house... better than good customer service as company replied asap.  The technician determined that the underground line had to be replaced as it was bad.  He stated that the utility company would be out on Monday 2 days later to mark the ground for utility lines... so I took a day off from work on Monday so I could be home to let them know that they only had to mark one side of the house as we wanted the new cable run to our garage rather than running it twice the distance around the back of the house and come into our living room.  My husband decided it would be less work and he said it would be easier to have the moden, router and VOIP box located in the garage in one easy to reach to location.  Well, Monday came and went and no one showed up.  After 4 phone calls to Comcast througout the day I was told on the 4th call by a CSR that at 4:00 that day my service was canceled.  It was about 5:00 when I called.  I asked why they canceled it and they stated that the tech said no new cable was needed... well that can't be true, we were losing signal, he checked it out and stood in my living room, and stated it was bad and on top of it, gave me a yellow service sheet stating in his own writing that there was a bad drop need new.  I was not happy to hear this as I took day off of work to be home and no one showed up.  The last CSR explained that if we continue to have problems to call back.    So from this moment on, I am thinking okay, I'm nuts, and I guess I will have to wait for it to break again before I call back.    The week of 4/24, I came home from work and there was blue and green spray paint outlining my underground utilities, I then thought, okay Comcast canceled their part of the job, but did not cancel the utility company from coming out.  So I did nothing... well on 4/24 on my day off, a knock came at the door, it was a sub-contractor who notified me that they were at my home to run new cable.  Now I am thinking okay, what's going on.  I called Comcast to tell them that new cable had been run and when were they sending the tech out to hook it up... well guess what, Comcast stated, we have no order for you... what a surprise.  Once I told them the entire story, they set up for a tech to come out the following day on the 25th to hook up the new cable.  But here is the bad news... during the dig to lay new cable the sub contracted company shoveled through my main sprinkler system pipe that runs into my house and busted it wide open.  It's white PVC.. they explained that they made the error and would fix it the next day.  Well the next day on the 25th, no one showed up... yet another surprise.  Along with this, the tech who came out stated that because we ran the new cable into the garage rather than running it where it was before to the living room that he could not hook anything up because it needed to be grounded... running it across the back of our yard to where it was before would have been a nightmare.. we have a paver patio that they could not get under thus having to run it all the way around our pool to the other side of the house... so this hook up never got done and Comcast will not do it until my husband puts in a ground.    So the story continues, now I have a gaping hole in my yard with a broken main sprinkler line... that never was repaired.  I spent 1/2 my day on my cell phone calling Comcast and asking to speak to a manager to help get the water line fixed today 4/26... as it was due to rain for the next 4 days and cannot get mud and have the hole fill with water, I explained I wanted the repair done today.  After several calls, much agravation and many hours of my day, I finally got a hold of someone who in my opinion was the best at helping me. She had a service manager who I cannot remember his name along with her pushing to get this fixed asap.  Finally they contacted the construction co. (by my recommendation) who had passed the repair off to a landscape company to fix.  The landscape company made it out today to repair the break, but would have been out sooner had they received from the sub contracted company who ran the cable my name and phone number to get a hold of me, which they did not, but after the woman I spoke with at Comcast and this unknown manager got involved they solved this mysterious puzzle, got me in touch with the landscape company to fix the problem.  Over the past 2 weeks, I cannot name every person at Comcast I spoke to, although I was very disappointed in the lack of good customer service.  Every time I called I had to explain over and over the situation, I asked on several occasions to speak with a supervisor and not until today and 4 hours later did anyone call me back.    If only we had DSL in our area, I would have canceled with Comcast and signed up with DSL... but unfortunately for us, Comcast is the only high speed we could get at the time.    Comcast is a very large company, I know this, but don't let size fool you as with continuous bad customer service, [they] will lose customers.    I hope [they] take this email into consideration and if only one other customer get's better service from this feedback than I've done my job.  Broken sprinkler system main line. Day off of work 4 hours of phone calls, which equals my time and phone bill charges"
1,"I called Comcast to inquire about its phone service.  On Wednesday, April 23, I spoke with the sales rep, PEARL, and obtained pricing, service features, installation specs.  I was prepared to sign on, but I told Pearl that I wanted to check with some other carriers and was going to review the information, which she had given me, with my Mother.  Pearl told me that her computer was down and she could not process any further.  Pearl asked me to call her back on Thurs, April 24 at 11:00. I call her back at the specified time, spoke to another operator, who told me that Pearl was busy with another customer and that Pearl would return my call. (She never returned my call)  While I was talking to that operator, I attempted to logon to my online account.  I was blocked from entering online and a pop-up message indicated to me that security provisions had been added.  The pop up instructed me to enter a PIN, which it alleged been mailed to me.  I had no such number.  The pop instructed me, if I forgot the PIN, to indicate such and the PIN would be sent to my email.  That didn't happen either.  Friday morning at approximately 10:30, I called Comcast to rectify the security clearance on my online account.  I was informed that the security had been added under fed law to secure my phone service.  I was futher informed that service tech was schedule to arrive at my house between 10 and noon THAT DAY, to change the phone lines.  I was further informed that a new phone number had been assigned. I told the customer service rep, Carolyn,  I NEVER AUTHORIZED ANY OF THIS.  She thought it strange too, because there were no indications in her notes of my authorization and that the new number and service tech has been dispatched within the statutory three days.   I would never have known that the phone service was being change had I not inadvertently gone online to look at my cable/internet bill.I spent more than two hours on the phone with Carolyn cancelling the unauthorized phone service and getting my online account security clearance.  The scary part is these people could have changed my phone service with my authorization, and reassign me a new phone number without my authorization."
1,"I signed up to Comcast for the High Speed Internet service. I have been a customer for about a year. I download large files at home and I also up-load files at home also. Apparently Comcast offers a connection to it's customers for 100 Mbps. I have used my task monitor to monitor my speeds and I have never seen any speed downloading any faster than a total of 800 kb per second, meaning 1 tenth of the bandwidth but at a higher price. On the uploading side, they offer 8 Mbps, but the highest speed you get to upload is around 47 kb per second. Far lower than the advertised speeds. I also noticed that Comcast claim to be on-line 24/7 is not real. If I have a peer to peer program running in the backround, I find that my connection has been lost and my computer has been reset or restarted resulting in loss of work performed.  I am also a serious gamer, who plays video games on servers with 50 other peers online at a time. I find that my ping ratio is far greater than the other players. An average ping rate should be between 80 and 150. My ping is variable between 300 and 800, close to 5 times the average. So where is the benefit of Comcast? My service is supposed to be a clear cut line to Comcast, but I find that my line is piggy-backed along with other lines, cutting the benefit of high end users to satisfy the masses, while still charging top dollar across the board. I also realized early on, when you sign up for the Comcast High Speed Internet, they try to sell you the upgraded service for more money. But Buyer beware, because for the more expensive package there are no better results, in fact the results are exactly the same, same bandwidth in the up and down slope as mentioned earlier, therefore when signing up, go for the minimum cost. I spent more money per year on Comcast services than if I had gone with another company offering the same deal on internet services for less, but received the same bandwidth in the up and down slope as Comcast had offered."
1,"When Comcast took over our cable service from Insight Communications they decided to shutdown the Insightbb.com domain.  This means that after years of using my Insight email address, I will have to hunt down and find everywhere I've used it to change my email address.  I had no choice in the change.  I did not want Comcast as my cable provider.  Now I have to deal with this and there is nothing I can do (short of canceling their service where there are no other choice of cable TV).  Comcast refuses to compensate me for my time and trouble.My time and effort to track down and change my email for sights that I may not even remember after 5 years of using the same email address."
1,"Comcast is monopolizing us, a city of 180K lower than national median annual wage customers makes TV more expensive than food! We pay more than ANY other place in the USA for this rip-off, they up the cost 2-3 times per year dropping Ch's as they go, unless you have a HD $5K set! The New World Order of cable TV mobsters!I know of MANY folks who can no longer afford cable TV so they stick rabbit-ears up and get 3 broadcast free channels, some go with satellite, cheaper but bad weather cuts service U still have to pay for for 2-3 months per year! Comcast has Spokane by the throat and keeps squeezing the life out of us."
1,"In February, as a long time Comcast customer, I changed my services from regular digital cable to in demand cable with high speed internet and telephone. I was a user of the high speed internet and the cable, just I need was the phone service with Comcast.However this was the damage, so to add the phone service was only 33.00dollars more so the new package that I have to pay was 99.00 for two years for digital cable, high speed internet and phone. So I agreed to pay 99.00 plus the installection fee that was 30.00 dollars for just the phone. When I received the bill Comcast charge me $500.00 dollars, when they told me that to change to have the 3 services in one package, looking for savings I got this bill.I called them which was a hard time because most of the time I called they hand out my phone call and when finally I spoke with one of they customer care they say that will scan my account and will change those crazy charge that are not suppost to be there. I wait for the result then when I recieve the bill this month they charge again more fees and did not clear my record now I have a 500.00 dollars bill that I do not know where here in Massachusetts I can go a clear this mess because I am trying to be a good customer and look what this company is doing to me. I use comcast because of the advange of the internet that can help me a lot with my work at home and with my research, but this is not reason to scam me. So please if there an attorney who can advice me and tell me what can I do?"
1,"This all started when we had a problem with Comcast, we were on a promotional agreement with Comcast and they broke it. They sent us our monthly bill and from the previous month the charges had increased over 100% without any notice. These charges are unreasonable fees and again without notice that the charges were being made. We did not agree to any said charges. They broke the contract without any notice & when we refused to be taken advantage of they threatened me with a made up charge for discountinued the service which again is very unreasonable. These practices are unprofessional to say the least and we would like to join the class action suit against them, as far as Direct TV, almost the same situation. We contacted them on November 30th 2007 to take a promotional offer they had sent to us in the mail for $34.99 for a period of 9 months with bonuses. We get our first bill and to our surprise we were charged full price for everything with no promotional prices.The $34.99 turned into over $90.00 This has been a real nightmare for the last 5 months. Every month has been something different and every person at both companies that I have spoken with tells me something different. This is really a bad problem and from what we have been told and heard we are not the only people dealing with this problem. Again, I wish to join the class action suit against these companies and try to stop these companies from doing this to other people. I have already received a notice for not paying from both of these companies which isn't right since I didn't agree to any of these charges. I need assistance with this matter ASAP from someone there.These 2 companies are threatened to tarnish my credit which is in the high 700's and I have been an upstanding citizen in my community for over the last 20 years. I'm a retired fire fighter and have served the people so I feel I need assistance here with this problem before it goes any futher. I just want these companies stoped from the bad business practices and before they can do more damage than they have already done."
1,"this the second account I have with Comcast where the billing of the account was excessive of the services rendered I will not be paying for any cable television services as Comcast was not able to provide service that worked for 24 hours. The day of installation once the technician left I had to take the equipment to be returned as it stopped working in only two hours.  That equipment stopped working 24 hours later when I set up an appointment with a technician who never showed and instead called claiming to be at my building and already having fixed the problem.  As it was not fixed I then called Comcast 24 hours later to cancel my account as the service never worked and they were clearly to impotent to solve the problem.  Furthermore, Comcast still owes me a refund, as they demanded an excessive amount in payments refusing to refund my money for the last year and half on a previous account.As each and every time I contact Comcast I am lied to, however when pressed to actually read the account information everything I am saying is in their notes.  The fraudulent billing of Comcast has been reported to the appropriate Federal authorities so they are aware that Comcasts standard operating procedures are fraudulent not only with regard to download speeds but also in their billing practices.  As Comcast admitted in the fall of 2007, they were already billing another account for my television services through 1/2008.  Obviously demanding payment from me for services already paid by another is illegal as I was very clear in August of 2007 that I no longer wanted the services I ordered.
Comcast was told in writing in January 2008 they had no authority to call my cell phone running up my bill because of their inability to follow through with and keep track of agreed upon account adjustments. Unfortunately each time as I have tried to solve this problem with them in writing I am bombarded with phone calls from a belligerent woman, Maria Manning, who is completely ignorant of previous account activity.  Paid in full but still being tracked by the collections agency for current account. Never received refund that I am owed on my last account.Never received refund that I am owed on my last account."
1,I have comcast for both computer and cable - there have been an continue to be problems with my hi-speed internet and now also with my TV - the picture jumps and ends up with a black screen and line going through the middle of it then it jumps and the picture comes on then it jumps and the picture goes off I've have a nast rude service person here and brought another computer into my house and hooked it up to my cable and that TV played - I would agree that it is my TV - but I know of several other people with a few blocks from my apt. that are having the same problem - is there no recorse for this - of just switch fot Verizon - Comcast really doesn't seem to care one way or the other - confused and very unhappy - 
1,"I joined Comcast because they said they supported Tivo, so I bought a Tivo HD; when Comcast came to install their cards the cards would not work. Now Comcast is telling me they never supported Tivo. My response to them was if that's true why were their techs. at my house trying to install the cards. They won't let me speak to anyone in authority nor will a supervisor return my calls. Yet they are screaming about my unpaid bill."
1,"1) When I switched from basic cable to digital with HD service, they had a lot of trouble figuring out how to set it up with TiVo, even though I called them several times before-hand to make sure they could handle it (which they said they absolutely could). They had to come out twice to finish the job. And even after that, I had to call them to configure the system correctly.  2) Each month, they charge me for an additional outlet, even though I am only watching on one television, because I have a dual-tuner TiVo. They did not tell me that was going to apply ahead of time and I really don't think it's fair.   3) My high-speed internet connection with them is slower than my former DSL connection. I sat for over three minutes just waiting for this page to load! I don't understand how it can be marketed as high-speed. "
1,"I was a Comcast customer.  Their service was a constant problem which they were called on time and time again.    They said the problem is over here, it's over there, on and on and never any resolve.  Finally they said I'd get a credit for 12 months.That never happened and now they are trying to collect for a service they couldn't supply."
1,"How can they take channels off the sports pack but continue to charge you the same?  Namely the NFL network. I pay $120 to watch TV and they just do what they want.  And there is no choice of other companies.  Hello monopoly!The consequence is they still get the same money for a lessor service, not the one you signed a contract for!"
1,"My phone is not working, and I checked everything: the cords are all plugged in and the light is on."
1,"There is simply not enough time and space to explain the difficulties we have had with Comcast's cable television service.  At times, the screen and various channels are blacked out, with a nice little message stating your channel will be available shortly.  Apparently the space time continuum is off in their neighborhood, as the channels often take days to come back on.  When the channels do work, they are pixilated, and the sound is often out of sync with the pictures. I am down to about 5 usable channels that I do not truly care to watch.  Does Fox own Comcast, because Fox news apparently never has any problems!  Customer service repeatedly tells me the problem is on my end and refuses to refund me the difference for my time and effort."
1,"I recently moved apartments in the same complex, approximately 2 buildings down from where I currently live.  I called Comcast to transfer service, and things were going fine until I was hit the the transfer fees.  Now I know where these guys make the money.  First I was being charged $25.99 for the reconnect fee.  Then I was asked how many TV's I had.  After I told them 2, I was then hit with a $13.99 charge to activate the second jack in the apartment.  Let's sum this up: $25.99 - Reconnect Fee; $13.99 - Additional TV Fee; $18.00 - Monthly Bill. To get setup this month with their service, it's going to cost me close to $58.  Every other company I worked with to transfer my services offered it free of charge.  I don't know how Comcast can actually get away with this, but I don't plan on being with them much longer."
1,"Since November 07' I have had nothing but problems with my service. After about 20 phone calls in december with no luck I decided to take my box to manahawkin to exchange. I was given a new one.two weeks later my box stopped working so they sent someone out to 'fix the lines' they told me there was nothing wrong with my lines it was the box so they replaced. two wekks later my box was not working again, so they sent some one out again to 'fix the lines. they replaced to box again and checked the signals and said there was nothing wrong with lines it was the 'new box and replaced again. the again a week later someone had to come again to 'replace the box! this was in january 08, numerous amounts of phone calls and I asked them if I could be credited at least something and they said no but maybe 40.00 that is a joke considering my bill is about 100.00 a month!! now here it is march 8 and I awoke to noe cable and no internet again! I called for three hours and finally got thru and they said someone would be out from 12 to 4 today. they never came. so at 5 I called and they said no one can come until tuesday the 11th and that no one should of told me that. so when I asked for a supervisor she (camille hung up on me) so once again I called back to get a supervisor and was told now there were outages in my area,even though all my neighbors had service but me! "
1,"I have had Comcast Cable, Internet and phone services for approx. 6 months.  I transferred to COMCAST from  Verizon because it sounded like a good  deal and also because the rep was a great salesman.  I had NO problems up to now!  In the past month, I have received numerous calls and have  placed numerous calls, and people cannot hear us, but we can hear them. I  called customer service, and they opened a ticket for a tech to come and  verify the installation. The tech said that everything was done  properly, but I still have the same problem.  I called customer service again with the same problem, and again they  sent somebody to inspect our lines. The tech informed us that he has  known about this problem, and it's a problem Comcast has in the area.    I called customer service again to complain.  Tech has been  here 3 times, and I still have the problem.  I run a business from my  home due to my disability (MS) and am working for a psychologist. I now have to call patients back  using my cell phone!  This is not the kind of service I expected. A  supervisor named Lorna was supposed to call me back yesterday, 3-5-08, but guess she is too busy.  Just wish someone would tell me what the problem is and if it is going to continue.   Do I contact the FCC?  PLEASE someone help me out here!  I've lost minutes used on my cell phone.  In case of an fire/emergency and cell phone not available, I would have no way to call for help."
1,"Around half a year ago I started having a problem; it's been nearly 2 years since I've been with Comcast with the Internet and cable combo. I got Comcast for it's High Speed Internet service and it was all great until a few months ago. Whenever I tried downloading stuff like my friend's Flash videos he makes to test, while using Bit torrent to download it,  the service started to either go from 168Kbps to nearly 5 Kbps or just completely disconnect and appear as if it never existed.  It does this also with live web cam chats slowing or freezing on me, websites not loading and everything slowing down except for a few important websites. Then I saw the report about them using some programs to scram the connections and control what they want and don't want for us to see. And at the moment, I'm just waiting to see what happens to the problem that the FCC is investigating. I also have had several times where the entire cable connection is gone due to an outage; however, it has only happened to me and a few on our neighborhood--along with some channels being randomly either censored or taken out. I had to quit flash video and gaming testing. I've lost connection to several sites and games I've paid for."
1,"Bad cable installation services, it is not working properly. I contacted Arlington county cable administration and nothing has been done . "
1,"A Comcast agent called me in December. He offered me the triple play--cable, phone service and internet for the price of $59.99 for the first 6 months. I accepted. When I received my first bill it was $203.00 dollars. I called them; they said they don't have that promotion, and I said well one of your agents called me. They offered me some free channels, that I am not at all interested in. They offered me for the same price, the phone service and internet services. Not the cable. I agreed, and guess what? My high bill came two days ago. I called them again, and the same thing happened--they don't have that promotion. They charged me $33 for each service plus the taxes. I am an old person, 60 years old, live on a fixed income. I cannot afford these mistakes from a company. Well, they said I have to pay. Would your company be able to help? Thanks for everything you can do. I paid them $100 for the first bill; now it's $142. If I don't pay, my phone service is going to be discontinue. I can not stay in my house without phone and internet service. I am a sick person, mentally and physically."
1,"I recently moved to NH and called Comcast to get information on cable and internet service. A representative informed me that the best deal would be to get cable, phone, and internet all together. I was told this package would be $113.00 a month for one year (Jan 08-Jan 09) which included all taxes and fees. The representative said there would be installation fees totaling $57.00. I informed the representative that this was not acceptable and that the only way I would commit to the installation was to waive all the installation fees. The representative later called me back and said all fees would be waived and again confirmed that the monthly price would be $113.00 including all taxes and fees. When my first bill arrived the installation fees were included making my bill $178.00 instead. A call to Comcast resulted in them telling me I needed to go to a payment center for them to take care of the charges. Once at the payment center they said that they cannot credit bills, and I would need to call the 1-800 number again. The representative at the payment center promised to email their supervisor and to call me the next day, which never happened. My recent bill came yesterday 02/19/2008, and the installation fees had been waived only due to the fact that I refused to mail them with the first month's payment. The most current bill is now for $132.00 which is not the $113.00 that was promised. A call to Comcast again revealed that they increased a cable service rate immediately after they committed to a monthly charge of $113.00. Also, they said that I was now being charged for a dvr box because the tech that installed the cable was only supposed to install an HD box. Comcast has refused to honor the commitment they made and even had the audacity to try to schedule an appointment to come and switch the cable box--oh and they were going to waive the normal fee that usually is charged, like they were doing me a favor for their mistake. So Comcast sold a product and then charged a different price. If this happened when using a debit card at a store, one call to my bank and the charge would have been corrected. It is amazing what a company can do when there are no reasonable substitutes.Comcast offered a product at one price then after the fact they failed to honor this agreement. This has me to spend time waiting on hold and will force me to pay more for my service."
1,"It is such a long story of fraud and frustration that I will skip to the present. I am not receiving what I am paying for and cannot reach anyone of knowledge or authority. I was told that the person in charge of the supervisors, Dwayne, does not accept calls, but that he would call me. It has been three business days and I haven't received a call. I cannot reach anyone who can give me answers, as in the past, I have been given inaccurate information (basically lied to) and have yet been unable to speak to a person of responsibility. There is so much to this saga that it is impossible to relate in an e-mail. I am not getting the services for which I am being billed, and the hassle of contacting the underlings constantly is annoying, netting no results."
1,"I have Comcast Digital Voice (as well as T.V. and internet) which was installed approximately 1 1/2 years ago.  Yesterday when I returned home, I thought someone might have tried to break-in my home.  My house alarm (through ADT) was showing an intrusion alarm.  I had not received a phone call (per protocol) from ADT, nor did the police respond (verified).  After finding out no one was in the house, I picked up my home telephone to call; I had no dial tone.  Finally called ADT on a cell, and they did not receive a signal from my house.  Called Comcast to find out what was wrong with the phone, and they couldn't figure it out.  ADT sent a service tech. out ASAP. The tech then told me we were not hooked-up to them.  He said when Comcast installed the Digital Voice they in no way wired our phone line to the alarm.  They had the alarm box/jack completely wired incorrectly with the wrong phone wires,etc. ADT said It wasn't even close.  ADT then told me that when the alarm goes off with it being wired wrong, it automatically disconnects the phone. When Comcast installed my phone they were told before installation that we had ADT, and the technician assured me it was no problem and everything was set up and ready to go.  He even said he called ADT, and everything was fine when I wanted to verify when he left that it was ok.  ADT confirmed that they never contacted them for the change, and when the Comcast tech was here he should have called them and sounded the siren/panic button with ADT for a test. I was here, and they never tested it.  So, we have been paying our ADT bill every month for no service, and then to find out, God forbid, in the event of an emergency, fire, or burglary, not only would no one respond--I would have had no way to call for help as happened yesterday.Loss of 1 1/2 years of ADT payments.  Potential risk to lives and home with no alarm and telephone when thought I was connected.  Walking into my home when there could have been an intruder."
1,"In December I moved into this new apt. and signed up for Comcast Cable. After the first month I received a bill for over $400.00 dollars for cable and about 100 ***** movies that were billed to me. I immediately called and complained that I just started this service and that I did not charge all these movies. I have been on hold for 15 minutes at a time and sent to another customer service person who is supposed to be a supervisor. They are like talking to a brick wall.  They have hung up on me several times. I have proof that my room mate and I were at work when all these took place. Then I got the bill the next month, and now the bill is over $500.00 with more movies. Again I called and spoke to a supervisor. They said I did it, and I need to pay.  They hung up on me. I have chatted on line, and they disconnected me. Of course I have canceled the service. I have called about 10 times, and no one will listen to me and resolve this issue. I am not paying for something I did not do. One time when I did speak with a rep, they gave me a different phone# than mine--a 510 area code and I am a 408 area code--so I believe they know there is a mistake and don't want to credit my acct. This is how they make so much money. I am so frustrated.  They are ruining my credit rating and my reputation. I have seen so many complaints about this same issue. I think there needs to be a lawsuit against them for scamming people."
1,"Fri/Feb 8:  Cable card stopped working. I made a trip to Comcast store for replacement.   I made a 23-minute call to Comcast for card setup. Told setup to be completed on Saturday. Sat / Feb 9:  Card not setup.  16 minute call to Comcast. I was told setup to be done on Monday. Mon / Feb 11:  Card not setup and another 38-minute call to Comcast.  Told card to be setup on Tues. Tues / Feb 12.  Card not setup and a 30-minute call to Comcast.  Told card bad. Wed / Feb 13: Trip to Comcast store for replacement card and a 101-minute call to Comcast.  Told problem unknown.  Serviceman scheduled for Friday. Fri / Feb 15: Serviceman can't find problem. Told us to get cable a box because the cards don't work well.  Trip to Comcast store.  Returned card but store out of cable boxes. Sat / Feb 16: Drive to Comcast in Webster to get box and a 126-minute call to Comcast.  Told box not working.  Second trip to Webster.  Finally, rep noticed error in Comcast set-up of my account.  Error corrected.  Returned home with same box, which worked. I spent 5 hours on the phone, 90 miles driven, a vacation day used, a service disruption and a lot of inconvenience."
1,"Comcast has everything sewed up in this area although there is another cable company called Charter Communications that is better but Comcast has blocked them. They also took away Anime Network and replaced it with Anime Select without warning. Anime Select has anime from the 90s with terrible graphics and a pitiful selection. To top is off, Anime Select is always down and they never seem to update their anime. I wish they would leave. They also have included Neilson's to monitor our habits to help them cheat us out of more services and money. Hurry up with deregulations."
1,"A Comcast Sales Representative contacts our residence claiming that we can have the identical services that we have with AT&T. The promised service is not only identical, but significantly cheaper with Comcast.  We have been Bellsouth AT&T customers forever.  Our AT&T service consists of the amazing 'RingMaster' service that incorporates 3 phone lines into on with each line having a distinctive ring style.  Comcast promises to seamlessly connect us with them and also to save a huge amount.  Well we did it!  AT&T releases the phone lines, Comcast ports them over and a technician is sent out to our home to install a new Cable modem that will also supply the new phone lines.  WELL... after the tech installs the new modem, there's no dial tone on the phone lines. 5 hours later; this unexperienced tech had altered all phone line cables in the exterior box, and had no idea why the line was down.  When we call Comcast, we are learn that Comcast DOES NOT provide 'RingMaster' service AT ALL. They could only support up to 2 independent phone lines, as opposed to 1 phone line that supports 3 as it is with 'RingMaster'.  Well now it was too late, Comcast has the lines, and we have to revert to our service with AT&T.  But it's too late... Still we are without dial tone and our at home business is a dead halt.  The Comcast/AT&T conversion is promised to take up to 12 business days. I would like advice in what legal action I could take against Comcast for their FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. Thanks!This has caused our business to have no communication for 12 business days, and the possible loss of the phone numbers that were established with the RingMaster."
1,"A payment of $325.75 was made to Comcast. For over a month they have been saying it was not paid even though it was taken out of my account. My Cable, Phone, and Internet were turned off as a result and I was forced to pay again to get them turned on. I have been dealing with this issue since. I have called my bank and conferenced Comcast, who after receiving a few faxes of the processed check from myself and letters from the bank, still do not acknowledge payment. I have spent countless hours on the phone with Comcast representatives, put in complaints with the BBB, emailed the Attorney General a couple times. Issue still remains unresolved a month later, and my bank account still short the $325.75.  Every time I call Comcast for the most part they say it is my banks fault. Bank says it's Comcasts fault.  Help desk representatives with Comcast are rude, and promise calls back from their supervisors that I never get.Cable was shut off and I was forced to make a double payment. In my time of financial need this has caused other accounts of mine to become delinquent. I keep getting the run around. I leave voice mails and do not receive phone calls back on a timely manor. I am forced to call again and again. One department says they sent my information to another department. When calling them, they sent it yet again to another department. My cable account now shows late payments, etc. My bank account is short the money. My other accounts as a result of my missing money have been affected."
1,"On February 6th at around midnight they mistakenly aired X-rated *********** on Cartoon Network, Headline News and numerous other stations. I did a Google search and discovered that this is not the first time this has happened.  So at what point are they going to be held responsible so that it won't happen again?  I suffered nasty **** images burned into my mind's eye."
1,"I am licensed by the FCC as an electronics technician. I have worked in this area for 28 years. I also am 18 credits shy of receiving my bachelors degree as an IT Professional.  I receive my internet access through Comcast.  I often watch movies via Netflix.  I also have access to the internet via my workstation at work. I have compared the upload/download speed through several websites that that give an estimate of internet speed under normal conditions.  Both my home and work internet access is almost identical.  However, when accessing Netflix from home, I get a message that my internet access is within the limits for streaming video.  The moment the movie starts, I get the message that buffering can take from 2 hours to 12 hours to watch a movie.  I have researched this issue only to find out that Comcast has been accused of manipulating internet access.  Also, formal complaints about issues similar to mine have been filed with the FCC.  Comcast claims that they are not manipulating internet access, but many folks are complaining about the same thing.  (Where there is smoke, there is fire.)Since Comcast is the only cable company in Detroit that offers high speed, people like myself who watch movies via the internet are just out of luck unless they pay for a dedicated cable internet access service."
1,"Three channels were deleted from my cable service with little notice and no reduction in fees -- Oxygen, Hallmark, and  MSNBC. I watched all 3 a good deal, particularly MSNBC. I want those channels back, without having to pay ADDITIONAL fees for a converter box. One of the main points of conversion 2009 plan from analog to digital is that if one does NOT receive TV over airwaves, but via a cable, converter boxes are NOT needed. Comcast's moving of these 3 channels to the all digital subscription plan is simply a bait'n'switch sort of business gimmick to try and get me to buy a higher priced plan. I had a contract with Comcast when I signed on that included these 3 channels, and I want them back.    "
1,"Two weeks ago I switched from Bell South to Comcast after I was assured that my Tivo and my hard wired Router would work with Comcast. A contracted worker for Comcast showed up; he was unable to hook up my 4 computers with my router. He was able to hook up one directly. He could not hook up my Tivo. The message my tivo gave said the cable box wasn't hooked up correctly. When I tried to hook it up myself I was shocked by wires that were improperly capped.  My biggest gripe is that I wasn't given a pin # to set up my email account.  I have called 5 times trying to get it.  The first time I called they said it would take 5 days--that it had to be mailed for security reasons.  After 5 days I called again.  This time I was told it would only take one day.  Two days later I called and was told it would be resent and would take 2 days. On Saturday when I called after receiving my first bill, they said I should get it Monday.  It is Thursday night, and I haven't gotten it yet.  Tonight when I called was put on indefinite hold when I asked to speak to a manager.  After spending $100 on a router and $60 for a wireless usp adapter (for 1 computer-that used to work on hard wire) all my computers are working.Damaged wall, new router($100), usp Adapter ($60) wire in front yard not buried (hazzard due to dogs and children)."
1,"When I moved in to my apartment, the Comcast rep I dealt with told me that because the apartment complex had a special deal going with them, my cable TV was included and the high-speed internet would be $25 a month for the entirety of my stay here.  Well six months later, what do you know, they raised my internet rate to $45.  I called them up and the guy says they only do promotional offers like that for six months.  That would be fine, except I was told otherwise.  I've worked in customer service myself, and if a customer claims he/she was told something like that, you go with it.  The customer is always right, right?  Well, now I don't know what to do because that guy was so stubborn, he was going to let me cancel rather than help me out.  "
1,"I have Comcast internet service at home. A few days ago my email stopped working. I could receive email, but I couldn't send any. I contacted my email provider, and we tried to troubleshoot it without success. Finally he suggested to contact Comcast. Once I got hold of Comcast support, I learned that they have blocked my ability to send email (they blocked port 25 used by SMTP). They do it automatically whenever their statistics indicate a possibility that the connection is used for spamming. I am no spammer and none of my computers is infected by viruses. I sometimes send email to groups of people as part of my business (software updates). It's always well below 20 messages at a time.  One would expect that the issue could be quickly resolved, but no! I was told that such a block cannot be removed! I will never be able to send email again, no matter what. I will have to find and switch to a new system, which will take at least weeks. In the meanwhile, my ability to work from home is seriously limited."
1,"I went to Comcast to reconnect my service which they cut off for their mistakes and over charging. We paid them $424.00, and Comcast doesn't show we paid that in their system. It's not my fault; I've never missed paying my bills. They have insulted me and were rude to me for their mistakes. My bill is supposed to be 120.00; but it's stating $220.00. I have over paid them and want my cash back. "
1,"Why is it that Comcast gets away with providing the most shoddy services possible for a non-comparable dollar amount? We have had nothing but problems since Comcast took over Roadrunner cable TV and internet service. Their customer service STINKS and always suggests that the problems are with your equipment instead of their lines. I work at home and have to use the internet on a daily basis from at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and almost on a daily basis I experience connection issues anywhere between noon and 4 p.m. My neighbors experience the same thing. So logically you would think Comcast would say, okay, we will come check out the lines in the neighborhood.... But no... We have to unplug and replug every connection to the computer and reboot, etc... and still pay the same outrageous amount for shoddy service. I refuse to pay for a service call when I know the issue is outside, with their lines, and not in my house. At least Roadrunner was good about coming and checking the lines and would at least tell you straight up if they were in the neighborhood working on the lines. Comcast will out and out lie to you... Oh no, we are not working anywhere in your area and all I have to do is get out and drive down the road within a mile or two, and there they are, dinking around with the cable lines. Why is it that we are forced to accept one cable company and their poor service? I lose money because I cant keep a steady connection that allows me to complete my work in a timely manner without having to unplug and replug my connection, reboot the computer, etc.."
1,"  Things had been going well at our home with our Comcast internet (we have a wireless modem/router for all 3 of us users) until January 1, '08. From that day on it's been almost impossible to access the Comcast homepage and read email on most evenings (week nights and weekend evenings). Their homepage just won't open because of lack of enough band width to support the demand in our neighborhood.    I called Comcast on Jan 1, '08 about the problem (1st night of trouble). I spent a long time on the phone with their person trying this and that with no fix, just excuses from him.  The problem continued Jan 2, and I called again and believe that my call rolled out of the country because the man who took my call was very difficult to understand and had an accent.  He blamed my computers, FireFox and Internet Explorer. On Jan. 3, the same problem that evening, and I called again. Ralph told me it was congestion in my neighborhood. (Not enough band width to support the neighborhood request for service--and the first person to be honest with me about their problem!)  I asked for a supervisor to discuss this and was forwarded to Amanda.  We talked and she opened a work order (#112006862) and promised me a call back by someone within 72 hours.  That call back never came.  On Jan. 20, '08 we could not get basic internet access, and the modem was not functioning properly. I called about the problem and Juan in Texas told us that we could exchange the modem ourself to avoid the service call charge. The next day my son was denied the exchange by the local office people stating that they had to make a service call to exchange it.  (Juan offered a $20 account discount for all of our inconvenience [haven't seen it yet], but it doesn't fix the problem.)     I am documenting every failed attempt to get onto their home page or internet access. I'm so angry that I can't read my emails daily on Comcast unless I get up at 6 am! I have asked all my family and friends to use my AOL account because I can usually get internet daily--just not Comcast homepage.      I'm paying a premium price and getting ripped off! I'm tired of their excuses. We have known all along that the problem is not enough band width to support the neighborhood demand. I have seen Comcast trucks in the neighborhood almost daily since Christmas. Plus, my son is a student at ITT Tech and has access to many people who know all about what's going on with Comcast. If I could switch to Qwest or Verizon, I would in a heart beat; they just aren't available in our area yet."
1,"I called Comcast's customer service department on the week of 1/14/08 and was told that it would only cost $115.00 to restore service. Once I was ready to make the payment on the week of the 21st, I was told that I had to pay over 200.00 to have service restored. After being transferred to several different people, I finally spoke to a Jessie who assured me that it would cost less than $200.00. I informed Jessie that I was on a budget and needed to know the full price before I made a decision. He explained that I had to pay the past due which was $115.00, and the reconnect/deposit of $50.00, and that the whole transaction would not be more than about $165.00. He stated that after I made my past due payment with him, then I would have to be transferred to another department for sales (to set up an appointment for the installation). Once I was transferred, I spoke to a Spanish women who did not seem to want to hear that I had already spoken to 2 people about the cost to restore service--after telling me that I had to pay another $140.00 (which would bring my total to $255--a $90.00 difference). By this time I was livid and asked to speak to a supervisor. Once I spoke to the supervisor, he stated that I was misinformed and that I have to pay at least another $100.00 more and be billed for the remaining balance in order to get the service restored. If I had known that I would need to pay the $100.00 more, I would have waited another week when I was more financially secure to make the payment.    After agreeing to pay for the extra $100.00 (since I had already paid the $115.00), I continued to place an order for one HD box for the living room and one regular digital box for the bedroom. I was given an install date for 4 days later.I was told to call the within the next 2 days to see if there are any cancellations.  I called Comcast within the 2 days and was told that there were none and  would have to wait until the regular time. During this call I verified that 2 boxes were ordered.   When the technician arrived, he stated that he only had an order for 1 box, and it was not an HD box. By this time I truly wished that I had gone with Dish Network! I called the customer service department (unfortunately, screaming on a Sunday morning) about the incompetence of the customer service department. Now I am going to be charged more money for the 2nd box, when I attempted to get the cost up front.  I can truly say that I am more than unsatisfied with the customer service that I received."
1,"I called Comcast to obtain an HD box and decided to try out one of their bundles that included internet, cable and phone service. Big mistake. I was never provided with any temporary password that would enable me to access services online like email and voice mail. All of the phone calls that come into my home are being sent to the voice mail service that I am unable to access. Despite multiple attempts to reach them via on line chat, phone calls and emails, the most that I have received have been dismissive responses. Fortunately, I am able to return to my previous ISP and phone providers and have initiated those changes. I would like to think that this monopoly can be busted up but do not see that happening; Comcast probably pays out a lot of money through lobbyists to insure this.   I have no idea how many calls I have missed that are in the dark hole of voice mail that I cannot access.  Fortunately, I can still get email through my previous carrier but had to make arrangements to do by remote."
1,"Over the past four years, we've had nothing but trouble getting hooked up to Comcast internet.  But this year has been the worst as far as correcting a problem in which the installer charged us for two services that he did not perform.     We've called Comcast's 800 number on several occasions.  The first call we told their rep about it, and she said she would take care of it and credit us.  But, we had to pay the bill and then watch for the credit on the next bill.  When we received the next bill, it was not credited.  So, we made another call.  This person told us that she would check and call us back---she never called us back.  Finally, we went face-to-face with a person at a local office.  She said that she would credit us for one of the non-performed services; but would have to check with the head office for the second non-performed service.  She billed us less, but then she never corrected the computer, and it still showed us owing more.  Basically, Comcast has stolen $40 of our money and will not give it back.   Sure, this isn't much, but if somebody took that same amount out of your pocketbook while walking down the street, you'd call a cop.   The Comcast man who came to our house claimed that he installed a new plug in another room.  He didn't do it, and we tried to tell them they could come to our house and check if they wished.  The second charge was his professional install charge where he was to set us up on our computer and get us rolling.  Well, he left and told us he could not set us up because the 'system was down.'  Later, we spent time making three calls to finally get us up and running. The installer did not perform his 'professional install' due to the fact that his system was down, yet we were billed for it. Just making our calls to get on line with Comcast over the years have given us a variety of reasons never to return, and we will not after this year.  If you call, be prepared to talk with people who don't know a thing about their company or the services.  Rule of thumb:  You must make at least three calls to finally find one of their tech reps who understands your problem and can help you.  Frankly, in my lifetime I've never dealt with a worse bunch of misfits.  It is obvious that the company does not have a good quality assurance program or an active customer service team that listens and investigates customer complaints. Comcast, at the time of this writing, has our money and continues to refuse to credit us for services that were not performed, and calls made to them have been a total waste of our time.  The cost to us has been added phone charges and gas money that we should not have had to expend.  Our first call to them should have taken care of the every concern we've had.  Over the years, we have been told by their reps that the problem is a 'software problem,' so we paid money to Microsoft techs, only to discoverthat the problem was turned right back to Comcast, who had passed the buck because Comcast's techs could not diagnose the problem correctly."
1,Comcast has been overcharging my account for a year for extra services that I never ordered. Their excuse is when they set-up the account (12/06) the extra-service was included. I ordered a basic TV cable and called them in January of 2007 to cancel any extra service. Their excuse now is that there is no record of that request. Financial damage: Extra charge of $13/month for 12 months=$156
1,"We set up our account with Comcast November 4, 2007 and we have had nothing but problems since then. Technicians have had to come out to our house close to a dozen times and it still is not fixed. We informed them multiple times that because of their service, or lack of, the picture kept freezing up.  The freeze up that we have been experiencing has caused a burn out on our TV. We did not have one problem with our television until Comcast. The Panasonic handbook plainly states that the freeze up that has been going on will and does cause burn out and now that is permanently on our screen. "
1,"Comcast is moving good channels like Oxygen to high channels in the 100's that I can't get, but my cable bill does not decrease.Why can they do this and charge the same amount of money. "
1,"I just received my bill from Comcast today. It is Jan. 16th. The bill indicates that it was sent out on 1/02/08. It is due on the 17th, tomorrow. I just opened the bill. This has happened many times before. It says that I can avoid paying a $7.00 late fee by paying my bill on time. How can someone pay their bill on time when they don't receive it until the day before it's due. By the way, we pay in ADVANCE. Not for service used. Service that will be used! I think that Comcast sends these bills out late so you will make a late payment. There is no postmark on the bill either. They know there are not a lot of options for cable TV and they have got you. I always pay my bills on time and I have excellent credit. Why do people have to put up with this? They say they cannot email you a bill or remind you ahead. They should get you your bill on time so you will not be LATE! I'm going to have to change to a satellite dish and have my email with another carrier. "
1,"I called Comcast to get another cable box, and they talked me into their triple service. It sounded great - high speed internet, all the cable channels and digital phone. I made it clear that I did not want voice mail. Anyway right now I am waiting for Comcast to come to my house. I had to call them on my cell phone; all the phones have been flashing since the phones were installed, and now today I can't call out. The first person I called to see why I had voice mail and ask them how to get the flashing light to go off, said it would take 72 hours before they could take it off. Why is the world so rude and complicated? I pay around $200 per MONTH to cable - enough for a new car payment - and the service is terrible. You can't ask for a supervisor they just put on another one of their cronies and you get NO where. A nervous breakdown - I am almost 70 and I sure don't need this."
1,"  I understand the marketing behind rebates. In a nutshell, most consumers do not follow through in sending them in.  I'm not most people, and I did jump through the hoops and sent in all the necessary items, well within the allotted time.  In doing so, I should have received $125 back. After spending a good portion of my morning trying to get to the bottom of this, I am told that Comcast does not have record of me sending it in; and the offer is no longer valid. I realize that Comcast is on its way to monopolizing the market, but does this give the right to swindle a customer? I ask that they please do what's right and correct this situation. I would like to continue to do business with Comcast and was planning on adding phone service to the list of services that I subscribe to. It's probably not a big deal to Comcast, but I also will be filing a complaint to the Better Business Bureau if the promise of a rebate is not honored.     "
1,"For 2 months Comcast has cut off my service, cable and internet--thinkng that is was someone else's.  All bills have been paid on time.  I told the rep that this second time, if it was for the same dumb excuse I would call back to get more than just a service credit.  Once again they came out for the same reason.  Called back to speak with the local managers--did not get the 24 call back. I called again and spoke with someone.  Their manager said even though it was their mistake twice in 2 months, they would not extend my promotional plans for an additional 6months. All they would offer is an inadequate $22 credit for another week without any service.  They have a monopoly in MD, and I can't get Verizon services yet were I am. So basically I have no cable (it is cut off), and I need the internet for school; so I have no other choice at the moment."
1,"I am a paying customer and have had a duplicate account established at another apartment in my complex.  This issue took place in September and has still not been resolved as of January 2008.  I called into Comcast, and they will not let me speak with a supervisor.  They tell me I will receive a call back from a supervisor, but two times in row I never received a call back the next day.  The account was only active for a month, then was sent to collections.  Since I don't live at the address, I was notified too late.  It's now on my Credit report.  I've tried again and again to get the issue resolved and the account closed.  While the customer support is friendly they are not helping me get this issue fixed in a timely manner.  I was able to get them to zero the account and re-call it from collections, but it still showed on my credit.  I disputed the charges with the collections so hopefully that will go away.  The issue that I am fighting now is they believe I have hardware at this duplicate account.  They use another company to collect hardware, and I call in and tell them I have no such equipment.  They have opened tickets in the past and are opening one again.  No process has been made with these research tickets.  Why can't they fix this before something else goes on my credit report for hardware I never had?  I'm a paying customer who has been taken to collections, with an account in good standing.  I shouldn't have to write into the BBB and other agencies to let Comcast know I am frustrated.  They should take care of their problems in house.  Overall I've complied and listened to every word they have said.  I went to the local offices, and they said to call and talk to a supervisor.  That doesn't work because they 1. Won't let me or 2. Say they are gone and offer to call me back.  Then I waited while they opened tickets for this cable modem.  It doesn't exist.  I waited over 10 days before, and opening another ticket isn't going to matter.  Comcast needs to realize that their support doesn't help resolve anything. I have called and talked to countless people.  This is an issue that should have been resolved in November.   My credit has been damaged because of this."
1,"I believe Comcast has been overcharging their customers with prorating and billing errors. I had cable with Comcast and internet thru Earthlink and the phone with AT& T. After many telemarketing calls from Comcast about the Triple play, I made the switch to go with their Triple play for $99.00 for twelve months which includes digital voice, cable and internet.  Since then my bills have not been correct. I have received bills for Nov. 07 ($286.00) and Dec. 07 ($213.13). The customer service rep told me to just pay what's on my bill, and it will be adjusted next month. I told her I can't afford to pay this bill with errors now, just tell me what I need to pay.  She told me to deduct the adjustments from total but not to be surprised if it shows up as an unpaid balance in my next bill. She said the problem was a glitch in the billing software. There are so many erroneous fees such as intralata $8.77, PCM $5.00, interlata $7.96 and feature pack $15.00--on the digital voice package that came with bundle in Aug. 07, that put my bill higher. When I questioned them in Oct. 07 the customer service rep said, ""Oh, they have been overcharging you; we will credit you for that.""I have been paying my bills in hopes it will get corrected; but the next month comes, and it's even higher. I am sick of calling trying to correct. I have wasted many frustrating hours and anguish over my Comcast bill, and I have overpaid but can't get them to correct the bill for that month. They told me they do not send corrected bills-- just pay the amount on the bill and we will credit you next month."
1,"Comcast of Newtown, 139 N State Street, has raised my bill by adding a franchise fee. It is unfair and unjust!  Why should I pay a franchise fee for my cable company when Comcast owns the franchise?  I don't own the franchise--they do! I have limited cable now, and I cannot afford this increase.  My bill went from $12.30 to $13.60, plus takes and surcharges: total of $14.51. This may seem like a small price, but when you are poor this is horrible.   I am single and barely able to make ends meet. This additional fee is a hardship."
1,"I was amazed to see that another complaint person is experiencing the exact same problem I am, and it happened at the same time.  I have had 12 phone conversations and 2 customer office visits to try and get this corrected.  Each time I am told that it will be taken care of, and still it is not resolved.  I was told just last night that if I did not pay $141.72 of late fees from ***** movies, which they know I did not charge, that my service will be turned off.  Please help me!  My bill is over $700.00.Since August I have been calling Comcast to clear a bill with over $600 worth of **** movies which I didn't order. After calling a couple of times (with no help from their agent), I finally got an agent to see there was a problem with the box, and I couldn't have possibly ordered the movies. The box was changed on Sept. 22. I was hoping to get credited for the movies and was waiting for a letter with the credit--which I didn't get.  In the middle of October my service was disconnected. I called again, and the agent said I was denied the credit. I was reconnected and was in line to get the credit--a form I was supposed to get in the mail which I never got. It's November now, and I got disconnected again. Called Comcast and they say they can't find the form, and my credit was denied. They say I have to wait (without cable, of course) about 3 weeks to see if I get the credit. It's really unfair to me to wait when it was a bad box problem. Can you guys help me out?   "
1,"Comcast is the only cable provider for the area where my wife and I moved. After the initial installation was completed, we had problems with the 1st and 2nd cable receivers installed and also very slow internet speed. It was determined by the 3rd technician that we had a weak signal. He said he would be back in the next day or two to resolve the problem. That didn't happen, and I had to call Comcast and set up another appointment. The 4th tech came and worked on the problem. In the process of fixing the slow speed internet problem, he did something to my computer so that now I have no access to the programs, firewall or anti-virus protection. (These were turned off during his troubleshooting and not turned back on and are still off because I do not have proper authorization. That is what pops up when I try to access.) I contacted the Comcast Damage Claims Dept. and Martin came out and said that it was not a Comcast problem. After which I spoke to his supervisor (I believe his name is Richard), and he said the same thing. They will not take responsibility for the fact that before they did whatever they did in setting up the internet, that they changed the configuration and settings that allow me to use my computer. I am told by Richard that I have to take my computer to a bona fide computer specialist at my expense to get it fixed.  I do not feel that I should have to pay for their improper techniques or inadequacy of computer knowledge that caused this problem. The problem did not exist before they set up the internet, entered my computer and changed my configuration. I have not taken the computer to a specialist yet."
1,"For past 6 to 8 weeks, I have tried to use On Demand to order a pay movie. A box keeps popping up saying I cannot do it, reference 225. I have called and called yet no one does anything. I even spoke to supervisor who assured me it would be fixed. Nothing. I get On Demand because I pay for digital programming yet as of late, I have not even been able to get anyone on the phone, just their commercials over and over. Comcast is the only service I can get. I live in a condo and cannot get dish because the association does not allow installation of dish on the wall for southern exposure. So I feel handcuffed with nowhere to go and no one to provide any service, unless I want to increase my service. Please help me if you can. "
1,I have called Comcast for over a year because my cable connection is not up to the speed they advertised. They have come over and over and fixed the problem for a few days or a few weeks but it always go goes below 400 mps. I pay $50 per month and get very bad service.  Comcast holds a monopoly and they should be held to some standard.
1,I recently moved  and was pleasantly surprised  with the reliable  cable and internet service from Adelphi.    I always had problems with  Comcast at my old home.  My service would go out 2 or 3 times a month or more.   I was disappointed to learn Comcast would be buying Adelphi.  As soon as Comcast took over I began to have problems.  Do these people at Comcast fiddle with the wires all the time or are they just incompetent.
1,"We were wooed by Comcast when we were using satellite service. We owned the all of the equipment. Service with the dish was intermittent depending on the weather. Unfortunately, after getting Comcast cable, we again only had intermittent service - and you pay extra for a home business account. To make matters worse, we have their cable box in our backyard. I have called many times to inform them of damage to our fence from other criminally minded neighbors who keep knocking our fence down to access the box. I certainly would expect to give free service if I was asking someone to keep my equipment on their property. But no, not only would they not match the competitors' rates (after saying they would), we continued to have service intermittently, were treated rudely by representatives, and were told the box would be moved out of the yard. Wow. I just don't feel like a valuable customer. And that's ok. I would rather give my money to a company who cared to have me as a customerMy fence is down again. The box is still open with all of the cable wires exposed. Of course, the kids cannot play in the yard because of the potential danger. Not to mention, in Aug. 2007, they put a new cable wire in outside in an attempt to actually deliver the service we were paying for. There was to be someone over in 3 days' time to bury the cable. But no, it's Dec. 22, 2007 and the cable wire is still hanging off the side of the house, through the yard to the cable box in the farthest back corner."
1," I recently ordered Comcast internet service. When the tech arrived, he started installing the modem. In the middle of the install he received a personal phone call. He proceeded to carry on a conversation with what sounded like his wife during the whole install. I was in the living room when the tech stated, ""You're all set."" He rushed me through the signing of the paper work, and then he bolted out the door. I then went to get online and nothing--my computer wouldn't even boot! I tried over and over to get my computer to boot up, and nothing. I called a tech from the company that built the computer, explained what was going on, and was very upset to find out that the tech fried my mother board! He crossed wires or plugged something into the wrong slot. I am now going round and round with Comcast, their contractors, and back. Everyone is pointing their fingers at others. I lost all use of my computer and gained a $45.00 a month bill for a service I cant even access. Comcast needs to replace my computer."
1,"After months of poor service and numerous calls to Comcast I requested an accounting of everything I have paid since signing up with Comcast, (appx. 18 months). I was told by many Comcast employees that there was no way for them to provide me with that information, and I would have to try and figure it out from the convoluted bill I receive each month. I believe I am being overcharged but have no way to prove it."
1,"Comcast is a nightmare!  They took over Timewarner and soon after jacked up all their prices.  So in Sept. I called to terminate service.  The customer service rep. was rude and basically harassing me about wanting to terminate.  I wanted termination the next day.  Done with her rudeness, I asked to speak to her supervisor and as she transferred me she disconnected my cable.  Every time I have asked to speak to a supervisor with Comcast - there is NEVER one available.  I leave tons of messages, and no one calls me back.  After dealing with that issue I waited for a final bill.  Comcast continued to bill me for dates beyond my termination date.  I made phone calls on top of phone calls and always dealt with people who could not do anything about it or would promise to send me a corrected bill. Finally in October I received a correct bill, but they were trying to bill me late fees of about $5.00.  I refused to pay. The statement was dated 10/13.  After numerous phone calls and emails I finally spoke to someone at Comcast who appeared to have some common sense.  On 10/24 they agreed I owed no late fees, and we discussed my final balance.  I immediately paid the bill.  A couple days ago I received a rude letter from a collection agency claiming I owed about $18.00. I called and they explained that Comcast sent the claim to them on 10/15.  Per their own statement marked 10/13, the late fee was only $5.00; but 2 days later was 18.00?  Hmmm...smells a tad fraudulent to me.  I have made several phone calls again: I had to leave messages, and no one called me back.  I terminated service with these clowns 3 months ago, and they continue to haunt me.  I am not paying for late fees that I do not owe. Comcast was the one who continued to bill me even though I had no service with them.  They are truly a company that does not care about their service or customers--only the $$$$.So now I sit here waiting for this issue to be resolved without it affecting my good credit."
1,"As a Comcast subscriber to phone, internet and digital cable, on 7/25/2007 I stopped digital cable service and turned in my digital receivers.  The system was down, and I was given a handwritten receipt.  On the next bill, digital service was not removed.  On 8/31/07 I turned in my digital phone and modem.  A receipt was given to me.  As of November 2007, I am still receiving bills.  Payments were made by me in excess of $250 after I had stopped service (one payment by mistake, and the second by auto payment which I had forgotten to cancel for Comcast).  I called in September '07 and was assured it was corrected.  Another bill came with full service cost on it, and I called back on 10/23/2007.  At that time I was promised a refund but was informed I would be billed until a serviceman went to the home and physically disconnected on 10/31/07.  There was nothing I could do to get them to disconnect me when I requested, but I was promised a refund.  Needless to say it is now 12/14/07--and no refund.  I called Comcast back and was told my account was charged off (great for the credit rating!) but that she saw all my communications and was forwarding my information to a supervisor.  I requested a callback from the supervisor and was told it could not be guaranteed.  I have asked to speak with a supervisor each time I called and was denied the privilege. I have paid $253.20 of service charges unauthorized by me.  They will do nothing about it.  It is amazing how businesses can get away with whatever they want in the U.S. these days."
1,"I have had Comcast since January 07  and have been very satisfied, until now.... I recently moved, when I called them to make them aware, and have them re-install me at my new address (a few apartments over) they were short on the phone, but I just thought they had taken care of everything quickly. I received my bill for the old apartment as expected and had no objections with the bill until I called to pay over the phone. My balance was $17 more than what was stated on my bill. A rep told me this was because I had moved and their was a small service fee for re-installment. That was fine, and I happily paid my bill. The next month I received a bill that was more than double what it should be. I called the 800 number and spoke with a woman who was extremely rude; when I tried to explain the situation to her she got extremely defensive and told me that she was a preacher's wife and she was not interested in ripping me off. I told her that I didn't care who she was married to and the company she worked for WAS trying to rip me off. I got annoyed with her and hung up, re-dialed the 800 number and spoke with a young man and his equally incompetent supervisor. Nobody could seem to figure out WHY they double charged me... but they were all so sure that they were correct and I was wrong. My phone calls went on like this for 3 weeks until I FINALLY was able to speak with a billing supervisor and after an hour on the phone with him, we figured out where the mistake was. The supervisor had said that he had to bring the issue to the attention of the corporate office, and I should be receiving a call from them in 5 business days. This conversation took place on November 15. Since then I have yet to speak to a supervisor of any kind and have been getting only pompous young operators. I have called once a day every day since then (now December 14), and the situation has yet to be resolved. I am also receiving late notices for the $150 they over-charged me, and I refuse to pay it. I find it funny how they contact me so well when they think I owe them money, but refuse to help me when I can prove they're wrong. The next call they receive will be from my lawyer.I believe that my credit may be affected since this issue has been going on for three months and is not resolved and I refuse to pay the disputed ammount. I would gladly take this to court and spend the money on a lawyer rather than pay it to them. Also, I'm trapped with this shisty company for the next two years because I unknowingly renewed my contract by moving, and the fee to cancel is outragously high."
1,"I sent a $165.84 money order to pay a bill covering October 17-December 17. Sent it out November 19. I get a notice around the end of that month that they have not received the overdue amount ($85 and change) and my service would be disconnected.  I called to let them know that I had sent the payment and was surprised to find they had not received the payment.  The customer service rep said he was put a hold on the disconnect until December 6.  December 6, I called to see whether they had received payment -- they said they hadn't.  I was told to contact the money order company and fax whatever information they gave me to Comcast. I find that Comcast had cashed the money order.  To get a receipt I would have to send $12, and it could take awhile.  The customer rep at Comcast had also given me the option of faxing the receipt of the money order I had, so I did, along with the information Moneygram had relayed to me.  I'm thinking everything is fine -- the fax will be noted in my file; our conversations would be noted, also.  The next day, Friday, my service was disconnected.  Now I used to have cable, internet and phone with Comcast but switched to Vonage, when after my year promotional bundle service Comcast doubled the cost of the phone service.  However, because Vonage comes through my internet when Comcast disconnected the service this meant that I had no phone service either.  I tried to call customer service, and after a long long time, I got someone who told me my bill wasn't paid.  I repeated what had transpired with another customer rep and the fax I sent.  They said they hadn't received the $85 and change overdue.So I went through it all again in person at their office, with a rep then telling me they applied the money to an old charge. Tried to reach someone on the 1-800 line but unsuccessfully.  I used all of my prepaid cell minutes trying to reach someone. I finally got someone Monday -- I think -- in Philadelphia who found where the payment went.  It had been applied to some bill three or four years ago. I let the rep know that the remaining amount should be applied to my current account, and I would re-send the balance to my current account.  Now, mind you, I never received any notice that this occurred and not once in all the calls to reps had anyone informed me of this problem until I went to the office. All got cleared--except my getting Comcast service continued. I think the lousy service and ignorance of company personnel that customers are put is a strong argument against monopolies.  I was out of phone service at a critical time."
1,"I'm a tenent in a house that has Comcast cable/internet.  When they first came to install the cable/internet, I had given them my number as a temporary contact number so that they could reach me when they came to my house.  Once the services were installed (I'm greatly pleased with their services) I continues to receive calls with anything associated with the account. Not only would Comcast use their automated system to call me and put me on hold for over 10 minutes each time, but they refused to remove my number from the primary contact number.  A company should call the LANDLORD if there is a problem with mortgage payments, cable/internet billing, water supply, electricity...anything!  It is NOT the responsibility of the tenent to handle any billing collecton/other issues and do your job for you. Comcast won't remove my number from their contact list and expect me to navigate their jumbled hierarchy of tele-networks for a mistake that is theirs--a mistake I have brought to their attention just to help out.  Comcast may understand good cable/internet, but their customer service is HORRIBLE.Wasting my valuable time....I don't need to be talking to Comcast while at work over something that this stupid company cannot resolve."
1,"How can COMCAST CABLE T.V. remove channels and still charge you the same? For example, Court TV moved to higher channels, WE TV moved, and a lot others have moved to channel 100 plus. We have less channels and pay the same."
1,"It is one year that I have been having trouble with my phone and cable TV. Comcast fixes one problem, and a few months later another one pops up. Recently, with my last problem, I was threatened by the regional VP Doug Guthrie, in my area, that he would shut off my service. I know he is saying this because as a customer, I have been his worst nightmare because there are problems in my neighborhood that they cannot seem to fix.  He stated to me that I have cost him a lot of money, and he would pay me to get rid of me. I have spent countless hours for one year now trying to get the service that I am paying for. I feel that Comcast is being fraudulent in what they say that they can do, but really cannot do. I also have written to Attorney General Blumenthal recently about this same problem. This is making me physically sick with headaches, loss of sleep, stomach upsets and so forth because I am so, so frustrated with this company."
1,"I wish I had not signed up for Comcast; they have customer problems. I do not want Comcast's emails, silly news, intrusions, slow internet, poor service. Their screen is full of entertainment news that I do not want my child reading. I got two Comcast bills in one month--one bill only a week after installation with a demanding due date just a few days later. They have interrupted service on two occasions with no explanation. Now I have learned that since I paid my bill online, they stopped sending me a paper bill. They tell me I requested this; no I did not, or at least unknowingly. I can't even look at my bill without a Comcast email account.  So, no thank you Comcast.  Any more intrusions, and I will drop you altogether.  But now I learned that it will cost me to stop service.  There has got to be something better. They have obvious money problems.Their customer service rep told me several other ways to pay my bill; I will do it by phone, or send it in. In general, I do not like being forced to have an email account with their self generated pin # --so they can probably sell the email address to advertisers/further spam. What have I got myself into?"
1,"Besides the hours lost while sitting on hold, I am out $150 that they made me put down on the boxes. "
1,"Comcast's customer service reps are rude and not professional at all. I have a bill for over $500 dollars, and there are charges for the internet--and I do not have a computer in my home. All these people do is cause problems and just keep billing you for stuff that you don't even have."
1,"There was a thunderstorm, and my TV was hit by lightning. I called Comcast who sent out a Technician. He told us he could not help us, but replaced the cable box, as the lightning strike had traveled through the cable to the TV. He suggested we call Comcast to ask them to send out another TECH to check if the cable was properly grounded, as that could have been why it happened. We called twice, and no one has yet come to check it. I would not trust them to say it is grounded; I would not know if they were telling the truth.  This happened in August 2007.My TV had to be thrown out; it was not fixable. I still get charged for the new cable box, though I have no TV on that box."
1,"I'm not getting Comcast's advertised speed and never have.  I've been shut off several times due to Comcast errors.  My wife and I have had a monthly battle with them for the past 4 years.  When I call the phone number, I explain my problems (no speed, wrong price EVERY bill, service shut off by wrong price, hardware malfunctions, and rude CSRs). They apologize and fix my bill and service.  The next week the service is off, and I go to the local Comcast building.  These people do not seem to know what the service reps have on file. It's like paying 2 companies for one service.  I HATE COMCAST!  Unfortunately they are the only providers until next year."
1,"I ordered 2 cable cards from Comcast for my 2 TIVO units.  Their rate sheet and website state that the first cable card per device would be free.  However, they charged me $1.50/month for the second cable card.  I made repeated calls and even went to their office to no avail.  I checked my contract, and it seems that I am required to arbitrate to get my $1.50 back.  This is unrealistic for such a small amount.  They might as well have carte blanche to steal! "
1,"I encountered a Comcast RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP while I was having a problem with on demand freezing. After asking to speak to Katelyn's supervisor at 1:22 am, at 2:10am her supervisor Debbie tried to tell me not to base my one experience with Katelyn on Comcast. Katelyn IS a Comcast employee and Comcast employed Katelyn as a representative for their company. I feel foolish paying them for not only their barely-there cable service but for their shoddy DSL service that barely works. They take our money but won't respect us as consumers of their product."
1,"Comcast arrived in our town, coastal area, with cable and internet, digital phone, all in one, fastest internet available, no contract. I am not having such a good experience with this company, and after reading all the complaints, why hasn't the FCC done anything? We have been overcharged, local office agrees; now we have a credit, then we are disconnected, and in order to get reconnected, have to pay and then they will talk. All seems fine until billing date, and it happens all over again, It has to do with those boxes, being billed for services we did not have. After much back-and-forth negotiating over their errors, the 20th of Nov, the system still said; credit. Then one day before Thanksgiving, we were once again disconnected. Called and was told unless we pay $202.00, phone will also be disconnected. Imagine my children will be calling me at Thanksgiving, and my phone is disconnected. I paid by credit card. I have a dear friend with the Federal govt., asked for his help, and he made appropriate calls which I would not have access to, and finally received attention. Prior to this I had contacted our City Manager (due to FCC regulations); he also contacted Comcast and is furious over the way this is handled, and demanded a refund and a audit, by law, to be done within 48 hrs.. That did not seem to work, as well as my friend with the Govt. This is the first with my process, and hopefully someone will protect  consumers. No one can afford to put their money out,until a corporation decides to properly do business. I am outraged. Why are there laws, if they are not enforced by our politicians. How many complaints does it take to get attention? "
1,"We have been unable to access Comcast's On Demand services for over 6 months. We have had several technicians come to the house, and have had everything replaced from the box to the street. However, no one from Comcast has ever gone beyond the pedestal in our front yard to find and fix the problem. Comcast is well aware of the problem, as I have called them several times. What in the world can be done other than changing my service to Direct TV? I have wasted time and have no credit issued to my account."
1,"COMCAST has dropped numerous channel offerings from their standard service package within the past year, but continues to charge the same monthly fee for this decreased service. Their reply/solution is to force us to buy a more expensive package. I believe COMCAST is short-changing and discriminating against people who cannot afford their premium services. For every station they drop, they should be required to adjust our bill downwardly to reflect a decreased level of service.The economic consequences are that we are paying the same amount on our monthly bill for a decreased level of service, or we are being forced to pay more for a different service."
1,"Comcast has been charging us $45 a month for high speed internet access.  Comcast took over the lines here in Mendocino County, CA from Adelphia which provided internet at a speed up to 1.5megs/sec download.  The speed has steadily decreased under Comcast's takeover. It is a 2/3 reduction in speed in some cases.  Moreover I found out tonight that I am paying for 6 megs a sec. So I am getting 1/12th of what I am paying for. I have been timed out three times, the last after 15 minutes of trying to get it out and less than1/2 completion. I am unable to get what I am paying for or reliable upload and downloads at the speed I am paying for.  My contacts therefore cannot get important documents that are part of a political campaign."
1,"Since August I have been calling Comcast to clear a bill with over $600 worth of **** movies which I didn't order. After calling a couple of times (with no help with their agent), I finally got an agent to see there was a problem with the box, and I couldn't have possibly ordered the movies. The box was changed on Sept. 22. I was hoping to get credited for the movies and was waiting for a letter with the credit--which I didn't get.In the middle of October my service was disconnected. I called again and the agent said I was denied the credit. I was reconnected and was in line to get the credit--a form I was supposed to get in the mail which I never got. It's Novemeber now and I got disconnected again. Called Comcast and they say they can't find the form, and my credit was denied. They say I have to wait (without cable, of course) about 3 weeks to see if I get the credit. IT's really unfair to me to wait when it was a bad box problem. Can you guys help me out?"
1,"I happened to be watching Spongebob with my 9-year-old daughter on November 12, 2007 at 8:11 pm when during a commercial break there was an advertisement for extreme martial arts, showing graphic fighting between adults. It scared my daughter.  On channel 59, the Cartoon Network, there are supposed to be programs and commercials suitable for the age group that watches it.  Why advertise fighting on a children's channel? I am very upset by this and will be writing Comcast Cable regarding this matter."
1,"I signed up for service around 8/21/07.   I received service and all was fine but by the end of October I noticed I hadn't received a bill.  I called Comcast and they informed me that they had the wrong address in the system and would correct it.  I asked for a bill to be sent to my home and they said no problem.  I waited about a week, no bill came.  Comcast called asking me if I was going to pay and said I was Overdue.  I told them what had happened they again said ""ok, no problem"".  The bill still didn't come.  Then my service was cut off.  I called and was informed that I should have called earlier since I should have realized my bill was over due! "
1,My complaint is about the recent change of 3 stations being moved off of basic cable. This is nothing but a ripoff. I also have Comcast internet and I am seriously considering getting a different service and going to the dish. I have spoken to a customer service person who just said that she could do nothing. It's kind of crappy to have a low paid person who has no control over this circumstance out on the front line to field many angy customers. Maybe if they spent less money on advertising they wouldn't have to overcharge us customers.
1,"To sum it all up, we have been having nothing but problems since July of this year. Our service was temporarily disconnected due to non payment in mid July. At the end of July we called to settle our bill and to sign up for the new Triple Play package since it will be cheaper. At that time we owed a little more than $500. We were told to only pay $370 of that since the balance was to be pro-rated for the services we had not used since our cable was disconnected. In essence, the remaining balance would be wiped clean since it was an advance billing for services that we were canceling and changing to the Triple Play package. In August is when all the problems started. Not only did it take 5 technicians numerous attempts to properly wire my new service, one of them leaving an estimated 2ft by 2ft hole in my ceiling that was not fixed in a timely manner, but to my astonishment when I opened my Comcast bill the following September, the balance had not in fact been wiped clean, they were charging me for having the Triple Play package PLUS my old service, also the charges for all the botched attempts to wire my service that were supposed to have been refunded were also there on my bill. Numerous phone calls and attempts to settle the issue were finally addressed when I was told to only pay $138 and that a dispute would be filed within the company and a research department would correct the issue. I paid it. Then in October, I try to make an outgoing phone call and I cannot. My service had once again been disconnected due to non-payment. At that time my bill was almost $1,000! Many, many, many phone calls had been made to Comcast about the issue. Supervisors tell me that I will get a call back, and they never call... and that's if they even listen to me. Sometimes I would just call and they would tell me that there was nothing wrong with my billing and try to get me to pay the full amount due. "
1,"Been a longtime subscriber so I figured I'd at least get ok service.  Boy was I wrong.I have Comcast digital cable/HD.  I bought a Tivo so I needed to have them come out and install a cablecard so that I could access the HD channels.  They gave me a 2 hour window for the tech. to show up (3-5pm).  No one showed so I called Comcast, they said that the wrong type of tech. was dispatched and that they would definitly have the right kind there before 7p. No one showed so I called again.  They said that the tech was running late and would be there by 7:30p.  No one showed up so I called again.  They said that there was no record of a tech being dispatched to my address.  I told them that wasn't acceptable since i'd been waiting since before 3p.  They offered to re-schedule the appt.  I asked to talk to a supervisor.  After 10 more minutes on hold, I got a supervisor.  He told me that no one shown up because it was so late.  I told him that that was a different story than the previous person told me.  I asked why he would lie to me like that.  He couldn't give me a good answer.  After a heated discussion, the supervisor finally agreed to credit me $60 plus a pro-ration of my service charges (approx. 1 week of lost service) and schedule a new appt. about a week later.  So I ended up getting paid about minimum wage to sit around and wait for them to hopefully show up.  Nice customer service?lost 5 hours of work @ $165/hour.  got $60 +1 weeks pro-rated.lost 5 hours of work @ $165/hour.  got $60 +1 weeks pro-rated."
1,"About 3 weeks ago Comcast added a home phone and cable TV upgrade. When the tech left my home I found out that Comcast had a new home page, and that I could not log on from there. November 01, 2007 I called BACK to find out why I still I could not log on via my home page. I was told that they would look into it and get back to me, probably within a couple of hours. Immediately, I found that I could NOW not log into my email. I called back and was told that for unknown reasons that all of my email accounts had been suspended and that a rep would call me back within 24 hours. I called back and was told that it could take 24-48 hours. I called again after a day and a half and was told that they were still within some 48 hour grace period. I could expect it to hear from the rep this evening or tomorrow morning.That did not happen. Now they are saying that I will be contacted by a service rep within 72 hours. No one is able to tell me why my email accounts were suspended. No one can tell me anything except that I just have to wait until they get around to it with these ever-increasing grace periods that they grant themselves.      I have lost all possibility of working the past 4 days (and tomorrow at this point) as my clients contact me via email and website linked to email. I have also spent HOURS on the phone with Comcast attempting to rectify this situation. I cannot close that account because all of my emails and business links are trapped there."
1,"I requested of Comcast that my cable service be disconnected on June 1st.  I've called every month, and I get the same story.  Ignore the bill (which is now almost $500), and I will be disconnected."
1,"I made an appointment for Comcast to install their triple play of highspeed internet, long distance phone and cable TV for $129. At noon the service man called and said he was running late. After waiting 4 hours I called and told them I had another appointment and needed to reschedule. I had a new appointment several days later for between noon and 3. At 2:39 I called comcast and was told my appt. had been changed to a later date. On that date I waited and after 2 hours called and was informed that the service man had been to my house and no one answered the doorbell. I was home and never heard anyone ring my bell. Finally he came back and installed the highspeed internet; however he did not have a cable tv box for the extra channels I ordered. Later, I turned on the internet and it did not work. I called Comcast and was told it would take between 24 and 72 hours to fix. The next day the internet came back on. A week later I still do not have the digital TV channels I ordered. After this two-week ordeal, I have decided to switch to Verizon. I am curious to see what my Comcast bill is going to be.I am a flight attendant and need to be able to go online to pick up trips. I had no dial tone and no internet service for over a week. It was only when I broke down crying over the phone that Comcast sent  someone to my home."
1,"We canceled our service with Comcast on September 17, 2007.  On September 28, 2007 we received a statement billing us for 10/1 to 10/31/07 for $111.27.  I called Comcast and was told that our account was canceled, were due a credit of approximately $22.00, and the bill generated by mistake.  On October 29, 2007 we received yet another bill from Comcast for $215.40 to include October and November 2007.  I once again called and was informed even though the bill was generated we do not owe, and that a Comcast Technician needed access to my fenced in backyard to do a lock out to completely disconnect the service. I had never been told that until a technician was able to access my fenced backyard I would continue to receive these statements.  I must be home and wait on the technician for 11 hours to lock out service that I cancelled almost 2 months ago.  I am extremely disgusted with Comcast and the way they have completely mishandled this.  The outstanding balance could cause us a credit problem."
1,"Comcast has advertised free webcasting of NHL games, and they haven't been able to yet produce a single game. You talk with tech support and all they can offer is a nhl game package at the price of $169.00 dollar. No explanation for the false advertising of the benifit of having digital TV with the package of phone and internet for one price. "
1,"I've had been a customer of comcast once before and the service was horrible. They advertise their ON DEMAND program to get you to subscribe and half the time I tried to use it I had technical difficulties. I just recently moved and I had no choice but to sign up with them again because DirecTV is not available in my area. I've had comcast for 4 days now and I've had to call them 3 times regarding my service. I ordered a DVR cable box and 10 minutes after the technician left the box stopped working. The ON DEMAND feature is yet to work for both cable boxes and when I called for some assistance, the operator had no idea why my service wasn't working. If they can't explain and refuse to refund any money for faulty service then I don't believe a company like this should be in business. They act like they don't care because they have a monopoly on cable service in South Florida."
1,"With Comcast I cannot receive most of my phone calls, my internet connection is half of what it should be, I am not receiving some of my emails, and I am being over billed. Comcast can't find the problem. They say is on my end, but a technician could NOT find a problem here. I had to call them a week later to find out what was going on. They continue to say that there isn't a problem, or it is on my end. HELP!I've lost money, been stressed, and suffer a migraine requiring a doctor visit."
1,"It seems that Comcast is the only cablevision we can get in our area. Because of this their rates are getting very high. My mother of 78, just for basic tv is paying $50.00 dollars a mouth just to watch tv. She was forced to hook up a box because comcast is removing a lot of channels. You know it's not like there are better things to see on tv, it's the same old junk for years and having to shell out all that money on programs we watch without paying."
1,"I moved from Florida to Houston Texas. I received a coupon to have comcast cable with 12 months free HBO for $39.99. I called and a rep verified the pricing and scheduled a tech to come out to install both the cable and internet. Afterwards I was having alot of trouble with reception and my internet was not working. I called 4 times to schedule someone to come out to do the repairs. 3 of the 4 times no one showed up. Got my first bill and the pricing was incorrect. I called the billing department and after 35 mins explaining the situation, I was given a credit. I just received my next bill and they charged me again for the credit I was issued. I am at a loss as to who to talk to, when you ask for a supervisor, no one is available to talk with you. This is a horrible company. What do you do?"
1,First in March 2007 I added phone service and was told w/the internet & television it would cost me $129.99. After installation the next day I had no service for all 3 of the above. After multiple tries to resolve at the 1800 number I had to contact the corporate office. They resolved the issue with TV & internet and the phone service is limited. I have contacted them for the problem with the phone service with no resolution. They have been charging me $129.99+ on my bill (even though the service was not correct) On my 9/15/2007 bill they increased my bill by $22.11 & 17.80. After having enough I have repeatedly trying to call them for the phone service (a tech came to my house for 3 hours after Comcast said they were waiting for me to call back after many calls & months) Nothing has been resolved for the phone service. The increase in my bill has NOT been resolved (a 2 yr price contract was suppose to be in effect) Everyone that I have spoken to has given me a different answer - some even saying that I should not have the charge and would correct the problem and credit my account. This continues to be a problem with no resolution in sight and Comcast has a monopoly in this area.
1,"On Thursday a Comcast technician came out for some other reason and put a trap on my line only, blocking my cable TV service which my landlord is paying for on my behalf."
1,"On June 8, 2007 a fire destroyed a large portion of my residence.  My cable and phone services were discontinued on this date. Comcast was prepaid for May 15 thru June 15, 2007. I had also sent payment to cover June 15, 2007 thru July 15, 2007 before the fire occurred. I went to their office on June 15, 2007 to make arrangements to have my cable and phone services restored at my new residence.  I was forced to pay approximately $68.00 more as a connection fee and payment for my first month of cable service. Cable service was connected on June 22, 2007. The phone service could not be turned on until later in the month as there was no one currently available with the knowledge to perform this task. I mentioned that my services were prepaid thru July 15, 2007.  I was told I would get a refund on the old address's payments. During the last week in June I get another bill for $9.19 for what they say are unpaid taxes on the previous payment made at their offices on June 15.  During the last week of July, after my phone service is added, I get another bill for $120.00 and some change.  I send payment along with a letter explaining my situation with them.  It is now October 2, 2007 and I have not seen a refund. I spoke with a representative on September 24, 2007.  He said the refund was in the file and he has not idea why it has not been credited to my bill of sent out by check.  The refund was for $88.00 and some change.  I paid 98.93 a month for phone and cable services at my previous address. I had no service from the 8th of June until the 15th.  They were also prepaid for a full month thru July 15, 2007.  "
1,I had contacted the cable company about a certain item i wanted to recieve. I stated that if this product did not become avaliable to me that i would change cable companys. I was assured and have the documentation stating that the product would be availiable. when the time came to order the product i was told that a mistake had been made and it was not availiable.Not only did i keep the service after alot of time wasted.. I kept the cable that i was going to cancel. and paid for three months with them i could have switched..
1,"After receiving an updated copy of my credit report I noticed that there was an account listed for comcast cable in the amount of $137.37. I was and still am a comcast customer, so I didn't understand how a balance could have been sent to a collection agency in my name. I moved from my old apartment to my new apartment and was told by a Customer Service Rep that I would be put down for an address change and have my previous balanced attached to my new bill. A few months after my bill I contacted Comcast in re: my new cable bill never coming to me, I was told the address they had on file for my new apartment and it was in fact incorrect.  Upon giving them the correct address I started receiving bills from a collection agency. After a few calls and research I was informed that the CSR who told me she was putting my account in for address change infact cancelled the acount giving me an ending balance of $137.37, never attached this amount to my next bill, in turn having it sent to collection. After months of phone calls and trying to straighten out the situation, I paid the $137.37 (though I was never given a straight answer as to where this amount came from, as it wasn't a full months bill.)"
1,"Comcast has been upgrading our service by installing fiber optic cable. While they're doing this, they've created an outage for the whole area. It's been two days and I still don't have cable. Didn't these geniuses figure out how to replace the old cable without inconveniencing a whole township for days? Apparently not, nor do they care. I've lost count of all the apologies I've received when calling to find out when the service might be restored. That is when I can actually get through to a human being. When you call, you either receive a busy signal (what else is new?), or have to go through the maze that is their automated answering system. This eventually leads you to either a disconnect or the voice mail of someone (I'm assuming it's a comcast employee - but you never know), who doesn't call back. When you do finally get through, the story is contrived, with no real answers. They said twice that my area was back online (when it wasn't), and that the problem must be my digital box. They scheduled a technician to come to my place yesterday. I waited all afternoon for someone who never showed. When I finally got a hold of someone I was told that my area was indeed out, and in that scenario the technician wouldn't show. They didn't even bother to give me a phone call to let me know not to waste half a day. This is without a doubt, the worst utility screw up I've ever witnessed."
1,For well over a year I have been experiencing poor signal problems. After 4 technicians and 2 sub-contractors we are still paying a premium for a service that we do not have.  Customer service is a joke.  They are unable to even locate our account in their system.
1,"For weeks in August I've had service interuptions for hours every day. Comcast sent a rep to check the problem, he said he is an in-home tech and that the problem was outside. Now it's September and I've had no service for 48 hours. This is a reoccurring thing with them daily. They can never tell you when service will be back.  Can't get customer service on the phone, had to chat with them online. I think the monopoly that they have in south Florida should be busted up, especially with apartment complexes.  "

1,Comcast is charging their existing customers in good standing that pays their bill every month more money than new customers.  The long standing customers also does not qualify for bundle package because we are OLD customers.  This is not fair and is not right.  I just received notice that my DVR service is going up and i have only had that service for 2 months.I want the bundle package at the same rate new customers are getting or at the very least do not increase my bill whenever they have a special promotion for new customers.

1,"Talked to 6 reps, with each giving different answers about cable cards for the newer  TV.  Finally I picked up a card to find out what I would receive.I found my TV picked up less channels and did not pick up what they said it would pick up for digital starter.I would need to purchase two /packages up just to receive the channels they have taken.  Not to mention they say we get 77 channels but truth is we get 68 and losing channels as time goes by, but they will not reduce the price.They bait you to the next two higher priced tiers at $77.00 form $50.00.I can get more if I take their box and remote at no cost, but I bought this TV with cable card ability so I would not have to get box and another remote. Their cable card does not have two way communication like their box does so I can not receive on demand and other channels?  So now I am losing channels and my rate is not going down.This amounts to a rate increase and if I buy another package this amounts to another rate increase.I agreed to pay X and now they fail to deliver."
1,"On or about January 27th, I contacted Comcast to cancel service, I was moving and lucky me, Verizon FIOS was in my new area.  I asked the Comcast operator where I could return my equipment to, and how long I had since I was leaving for vacation.  The operator told me one month was the limit.  I returned the equipment about two weeks after cancelling service; and two weeks after returning the equipment I received a bill for $413 from Comcast for equipment that was not returned, an HD Receiver and Cable Modem.  I called to rectify the issue and tell them in fact I did return the equipment.  I was told since I was no longer a current customer, an investigation what happened to the equipment would be started, and thet my final bill would recalculated once the investigation was completed. During the next two weeks, I repeatedly called Comcast as a followup, but was told they were still investigating.  On April 4th I received a collection letter from Eastern Account Systems of Connecticut on behalf of Comcast. I was in debt to comcast and they were retained to collect the debt.  I called the collection agency but they closed at 5 PM Daily. I called comcast, complained, and paid via credit card, and also paid the $4.95 surcharge to have an operator process my card.  The operator stated she could not see any investigation conducted on my behalf.  Was it all a lie by Comcast?  I called the collection agency the next day to inform them the debt was paid, and how poorly Comcast has handled this issue. ...  I've never had a late payment in my life outside of the nonsense from Comcast.  As a Dept of Defense employee, I need to file any collection/debt issues for review to ensure I am not a security risk.  It is a lot of paperwork that Comcast and Eastern Account System of CT have caused me, which could have been avoided had Comcast shown me some courtesy/competence and resolved the issue.  I will go witout cable before going back to Comcast."
1,"I cancelled my service with Comcast on 1/11/2007 @ 1503 MST. I was informed that I owed them a Cable Modem which was placed on my work order from 9/18/2003. I don't have any proof that I bought & paid for the surfboard myself., but I did.What bothers me is that Comcast Cable sent me to a collection agency even before I received my final bill.  "

1,"I have had many problems in the past with Pay-Per-View charges on my billing statement that was not ordered by me or anyone in my house. Few months ago there was many PPV movies charged to me and I had to go through weeks of phone calls to have it cleared. They were nice enough to give me free HBO for a year for the trouble I had to go through. Now the charges have started to appear on my bill again and I called several times to complain. They have denied giving me credit this time because they said the charges are mine and they wont do it again. Money is not the issue here, I'd pay the charges anytime but the charges are not mine."
1,I want to lodge a complaint with comcast. I am very upset that the Simpsons show is on Limited cable and on at 6:30 and 7:00. It is terrible that children can watch this show. Not to mention South park! Get these shows off the limited TV stations. They are horrible for children.
1,"Comcast Cable has been charging me for a cable modem which I have not used for over 19 months now. Each time I attempt to correct the situation, they do nothing about it. They have told me repeatedly that I will receive a new bill reflecting a credit but I have yet to receive and every time I call they again do nothing about this. "

1,"I was referred to 6 different people, to the technical department 4 times with my inability to access my voice mail from my brand new AT&T phone. I Was told that there was nothing they could do that it was some hardware problem was told by a supervisor that the problem would be dealt with and was sent back for the then 5th time to the tech dept. Eventually after a week they admitted that there were 8 different models of phone that their system did not recognize and was promised credit equal to the cost of a new phone. I am waiting to see."

1,I received my January bill from Comcast and have found that some of the services have risen over 45% from what I previously paid. Example: I have (2) DVRs that used to cost $9.95 each per month. They are now charging me $11.95 for the 1st and $16.90 for the 2nd. This is outrageous!
1,"What a terrible, confused company for consumers to have to deal with.  They offer a deal call the triple play which they advertise as including digital cable, phone and internet service for $99.00. When I purchase this plan I was happy at first, then I stopped receiving a lot of the channels.  When I called I was told that I was only suppose to have basic cable not digital.  So in order to get the channels I originally had I had to upgrade.To make a long story short my bill ended up being $168.00.  If you only receive basic cable with this offer, then that is what should be stated - not digital."
1,"I have a Comcast service plan for cable/internet/phone package that totals $120.93/month. I received a call from a Comcast representative indicating that my promotional period has ended for the bundled package and my rate will go up to nearly $148.00/month - a nearly 23% increase. First, when I decided to go with the bundle package of service Comcast did not tell me this was a promotional rate. I specifically asked the sales representative if the prices would go up on the bundle has it had with cable and the representative seid it would not. But here now a year later it is going up 23% and there's no alternative broadband cable available in Attleboro to contact for a competitive service."
1,"We've had nothing but trouble since Digital cable was installed.  The trouble, well, none of the channels worked.  Came as distorted then a blank blue screen.  Even though we've paid the invoices, we couldn't even watch anything.  We've had contractors sent from Comcast over our house several times, and they couldn't fix anything.  In fact, they suggested a fix by drilling holes in our house to increase the signal!!  I then called Comcast and argued for some time to send actual Comcast technicians over.  Finally, they came, fixed the signal in the cable box outside, and Badda Bing, we have a picture!"
1,"My cable went out 6 nights ago, and there is no solution in sight as far as getting it back. I have had to call them 3 times so far just to describe my issue and each time was on hold for 40 minutes.  Nobody seemed to know why I had no cable, no one is in any hurry to fix it and certainly, no one cares. Fine.  So the last answer I got (they have all been different) was that my cable will be back in, oh, a month or so. They really have no clue what they are doing.In the meantime, I got on the phone with DirectTV and after all was said and done, my DirectTV pacakge will be $20 cheaper per month than my Comcast bill. They will be here in a few more days, at which point I will cancel my service with Comcast with great glee.  "
1,"In 2003 I took advantage of a Comcast promotional offer of internet and cable.  The offer was that if you signed up for both you got basic cable and then if you added internet WITH CABLE you got an additional 60 channels (in essence the standard cable).  Before accepting this I checked with their rep and was assured that as long as I didn't change the service the price would remain the same.  Then early this year after four servicemen put in the wrong cable the last serviceman again put in the wrong service and downgraded my service.  Despite the fact that the bill has 2 lines; basic cable and Internet with cabel - Comcast refused to return my service to that contracted and kept telling me I only had basic cable (8.99) and had been getting standard cable for the basic price.  When I pointed out that I had internet service WITH cable and that this entitled me to the service I had been receiving for the past three years - they would completely ignore that aspect of the bill.  No matter how many times I pointed out the second line of the bill - it was ignored.  The next month my bill went from $54.00/mo to $22/mo.  Still they refused to acknowledge their mistake.  This month I finally figured out why.  It was so they could change the service and my bill to $45.00 for internet and $36.00 for standard cable.  They are such a devious, unscrupulous company that cannot be trusted.I'm paying more for less.  "
1,"Unresolved issues for over a month - constant disconnects, severe packetloss. After 3 tech visits in one week (not the usual contracted help for once) the problem still hasn't been resolved. Cable tv and internet cuts in and out randomly, house has been rewired, connectors have been reconnected, splitters have been replaced, ALL by comcast, still the problem cannot be found. Not to mention the ""your modem may be the problem"" excuse has come up once. My modem doesn't connect to my tv nor does it have anything to do with the problems I am having with the cable that runs into my living room and transmits through my tv. I have been told I will be credited fo the time that I have been having the problem once the issue is fixed. What about the days of work I have missed to make their 8-12. 12-7 appts?!!"
1,"This is the second time I'm having trouble with Comcast. The first time was when I was getting my cable and internet installed. Due to the comcast's dispatcher's fault, I could not get hold of the technician even though he was in my building. The technician ended up leaving and I had to reschedule for an appointment later that day. Customer service was atrocious with one customer  service representative hanging up on me because I demanded to speak to her supervisor. I called back and described the situation to the supervisor who was completely unsympathetic to the fact that the dispatcher had messed up, that  one of his employees had been rude and the fact that I had taken a whole day off from work. He said I could either take the measly $20 inconvenience fee or nothing at all.   Three weeks later, the cable went out and I scheduled another appointment with comcast in the late afternoon. 1-5pm. at 2 08pm a Comcast dispatcher called me to confirm if I was still available for the appointment and I confirmed that I was. I called back Comcast around 3 to make sure if the technician was still on his way. The customer service representative confirmed that the technician had two more appointments ahead of me and would be here shortly. At 4 31, I spoke to another customer service representative who told me that the technician would be an hour late. Mind you, Comcast did not have the courtesy to call me and notify me of this, I had to call them myself. I called back at 5 31 to find out what the status was, and I was told to call back after 6, because there is a grace period of an hour for the technician to show up late. Again I was offered a measly amount of $20 for my 'inconvenience.'"
1,"We got a cable modem. It can only handle one computer at a time. When I use my laptop it works fine but when I plug the cable into my desktop I have to reset the cable modem. Then when I want to switch back to my laptop, I have to reset the modem again. I called tech support and they think this is normal. It's not. With DSL you can simply plug in the cable and it works!I have to either crawl under the table to the cable modem every time I switch, or buy a router. "
1,"For the past 6 months I, the customer, have had to call each month and ask for a bill.  Numerous calls to Comcast have not fixed the problem and if I for get to call and ask for my bill (as I did in March) I am caught of guard with a $120.00 bill. I can not understand why this problem was not fixed after the first call instead of getting the company run around and the latest is ""oh we have a problem in the mail room"". At this point I will be transferring my services to another company.  All because a customer can not recieve a bill with out calling and having one generated.  Do you see a probelm here?"
1,I subscribed to their sevice to watch HBO fights and on a live fight with James Toney vs. Hasim Rachman me and my guests got to see the great introduction from Michael Buffer and then blank a screen. My brother tried to call this so called cable provider with promises that everything will be fixed in 3-5 minutes. Unfourtunatly the blank screen still appeared and silence and disapointment filled the air.
1,I canceled my cable tv on 1/28/06. I was told at that time that I have acredit coming to me. I have since been contacted numerous times about my bill being deliquent. I was then told that I had called and re-instated my service. A call that I did not make. I recieved a call on 3/13/06 confirming that a credit will be issued. I recieved call on 3/14/06 saying that I was delinquent in paying my bill. I told themthat they were harrassing me and that if it continued I would contact an attorney. they are making it very hard to cancel their service.
1,I have no cable service or intermitent service. I'm on my third set of cable boxes. I have requested to speak with a supervisor @ Comcast never returns my call or I'm left waiting on hold. They have sent to my home 2 repair techs and deliver old cable boxes that don't work. Thier solutions is to keep sending repair techs. I have to keep taking time off work with no resolution.
1,"Last year, we bought the Nascar In Car package from Comcast.  They charge you 99.00 for the season but half of the season it didn't work so I would sit on the phone pushing buttons waiting to speak to a human being and time I would get to speak to one they would have to turn off my box and reset it.  By this time the race is about half over. This year we started with speaking to a supervisor and talking to her about the problem she assured me that it should be better well guess what.....it's NOT working, and of course on the weekend when the race is on NOBODY is at work at Comcast.  But the will credit me $5.00."
1,"Their billing department is horrid. If you decide to use comcast (or are forced to), make sure you keep an eye on every single item on your bill. Also, when you sign up or change something on your account, make SURE you get a quoted price and the name of the rep. So far everytime I changed the services with them they have screwed it up. they bill it totlly incorrect, and when you call back they have no clue who did what. the relationship between the field technicians and CSA's is non existant, and even from the technician's say its horrible.   as a comcast customer, having cable tv and cable internet... you are actually treated like two different customers. Cable internet techs have no training on cable tv, and vise versa. So when you are trying to cooridinate billing, you have to switch back and forth between these departments, who you have to explain you're deal over and over again. i complained about his and they have this wonderful (sarc) Retension department. i believe these are people who have worked both tv and internet and know the packages and prices well, cause obviously no one there has ANY technical knowledge about the service.   my advice is to keep your changes and transactions and SIMPLE as possible."
1,"Ordered ""On Demand"" movie for the 1st time in Nov.2005. I get the bill, and there are charges for the movie I ordered, plus 2 additional movies. The 2 additional movies were ************movies, and one was in Spanish, and I don't even speak Spanish. And I was out of town when these movies were supposedly ordered. I called Comcast and had to wait for a supervisor to call me back 3 days later. The charges were finally removed, but they swore up and down that those movies were ordered thru my remote even though no one was in the house. So, here we are 3 months later, and I ordered 2 ""On Demand"" movies last month. Again, I was charged for 2 ************ movies that I never ordered. I called in and  talked to a smartbutt named Mike (refused to give last name or last initial) and he says that I ordered these movies. Again, I ask to speak to a supervisor, and again I am told they will have to call me back because they are ""busy doing other things"", according to Mike. I am irate, this proves that Comcast does not care about handling customer concerns, all they care about is making extra money.  I believe they chose to put ************ movies on my bill for 2 reasons: 1. they cost more than regular movies and 2. they think that people will be too embarassed to call in and dispute the charges. The management and representatives at Comcast should be ashamed to work for such an immoral company. I am trying to find other reasonable cable and internet service in my area, but Comcast has a lock on the market here. Thankfully I will be moving in the next 6-9 months anyway."
1,"I am being ripped of by Comcast Cable regarding my billing.  I have had expanded/standard cable for years.  (The monthly cost for my area on their internet site states $32.78 per month), (the recent letter I received from Comcast states prices for my area also states $32.78 per month). My bill states I have cable (video) services which is not available in my area, and this is stated on comcast's internet site.  Ms. Talley states she did not know why this was on my bill.  I have got the run around period from comcast/employees with no solution to my problem.  I have copies of all e-mails I have written and all copies comcast have written me, I also have years of past receipts where I paid  and have been over charged for cable with comcast, and customer service does not seem to care or want to help me."
1,"I have had AT&T/Comcast services, digital TV, High Speed Internet and phone service for almost 4 years with very good service. I have had a few normal troubles, but they were always resolved quickly. Because of this service, I had recommended Comcast to neighbors. In September of 2005, when I had a problem, Comcast’s service all of a sudden was not up to the standards that I had come to expect. After an outage, it took almost a week to respond to a call. We started to notice speed problems with our High Speed Internet and dropouts with our digital TV. In December of 2005, the High Speed started dropping out enough that simple Web pages were difficult to display. In January, it changed from happening once a week or so, to several times a week. It was totally unreliable. Because Comcast could not get technicians out when the problem was happening, by the time they arrived, the problem would disappear. After having 4 or 5 technicians out to our house, they confirmed that the problem was not in our house. At that point they were supposed to open a maintenance work order, but it never got opened. Multiple phone calls to the normal trouble line produced no results. These people were not able to troubleshoot the problem to the root of the cause. They are only trained to trouble shoot the single home that is called in, not an entire network that may be experiencing the problem.  The most disturbing issue is, Comcast is not able to track all of the issues reported to them in order to recognize a wide spread problem. Also, after the initial contact and report is made, there is no way to get back and talk with the same person that was working on the issue. This results in completely retroubleshooting the issue and complete frustration on the part of the customer. Comcast is totally unresponsive to their customers."
2,Love my Echo!
2,Loved it!
2,"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home."
2,"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well."
2,Music
2,"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do."
2,"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."
2,I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.
2,looks great
2,"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!"
2,"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."
2,I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times
2,"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!"
2,"Love, Love, Love!!"
2,Just what I expected....
2,"I love it, wife hates it."
2,Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.
2,We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.
2,We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound
2,"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"
2,Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.
2,"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying."
2,"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at."
2,I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask
2,"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."
2,Amazing product
2,"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge."
2,Sounds great!! Love them!
2,"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."
2,Just like the other one
2,Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good
2,I like it
2,"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great"
2,The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.
2,This device is awesome!
2,I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.
2,"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube."
2,Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo
2,"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is."
2,"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!"
2,My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities
2,"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running."
2,So far so good
2,Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.
2,Great
2,Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.
2,Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.
2,I love you so much
2,No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .
2,"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español."
2,"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting."
2,Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.
2,The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.
2,like google better
2,Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.
2,Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.
2,Great sound and easy to set up.
2,"Love Alexa, bought others for friends"
2,Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs
2,😍
2,Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available
2,"Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview"
2,Love this just wish it had a built in hub
2,I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!
2,How easy if was to set up.
2,Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.
2,You’re all I need...na na nana!
2,Does everything as expected and more.
2,"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good."
2,Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.
2,Works and sounds great.
2,The sound is amazing and many collections of all music
2,Setting up
2,She doesn’t always listen
2,It’s awesome
2,"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located."
2,The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!
2,I LIKE IT ALL
2,I love it. It does everything
2,I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!
2,I like it and still learning how to use it.
2,Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!
2,"I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!"
2,Works fine!!
2, 
2,Clear music
2,"Fun to use, good sound quality"
2,The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.
2,"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo."
2,Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!
2,The speaker sounds really good
2,Good sound works well
2,Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.
2,"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music."
2,"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet."
2,Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!
2,"Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc."
2,Love it!
2,The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.
2,"Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more"
2,Love it!
2,"awesome thing, love Alexa"
2,It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!
2,"LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!"
2,The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.
2,Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!
2,I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.
2,"It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better."
2,The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.
2,"Great device, responsive and helpful"
2,"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that."
2,Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.
2,Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.
2,"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product."
2,"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!"
2,It's Alexa.... what else can you say
2,Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound
2,"Excellent product, set up with ease as well."
2,I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.
2,I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.
2,wonderful product and fast delivery!
2,Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.
2,It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!
2,Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.
2,How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .
2,Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.
2,Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.
2,"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well."
2,Love our echo
2,"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her."
2,"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it."
2,I love having an Alexa!
2,So far I like it 🤓
2,I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.
2,Still love it
2,Love it
2,"I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound."
2,I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.
2,"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him."
2,"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool."
2,Cool
2,Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.
2,it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself
2,I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.
2,"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title."
2,I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.
2,The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.
2,"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music."
2,Love it
2,awesome.understands my kids
2,We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.
2,Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.
2,"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music."
2,"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries."
2,This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!
2,"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"
2,Versatile and fun !!!
2,Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.
2,We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.
2,so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app
2,"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?"
2,Easy to set up.
2,I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected
2,A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.
2,Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!
2,"I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call."
2,Good Value
2,Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!
2,Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa
2,BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.
2,Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.
2,Sound quality
2,Entertainment
2,Very good quality
2,Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability
2,Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.
2,Alexa rocks
2,"Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes."
2, 
2,"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without."
2,Love it!! Great product!!!
2,Easy set up very user friendly
2,I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.
2,Everything
2,I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.
2,Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.
2,I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!
2,Love it!  So do the grandkids!!
2,"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it."
2,Works as advertised
2,I love it!
2,"Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too."
2,"Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather."
2,As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.
2,A great device
2,I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..
2,Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!
2,Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.
2,Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!
2,We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.
2,Amazing paroduct
2,Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.
2,speaker sounds good
2,Absolutely love!!
2,The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.
2,We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.
2,Home entertainment
2,"Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated."
2,"Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use..."
2,"Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well."
2,Great sound from a little speaker
2,We enjoy it
2, 
2,Cool
2,"Good quality, great sound quality"
2,Works perfectly
2,"Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker."
2,Love my Echo great sound very smart!
2,Sure did !! Love it !!
2,plays great
2,Works absolutely great
2,Very amazing product. Great sound quality.
2,Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁
2,"I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it."
2,"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!"
2,"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!"
2,I like everything about it !!!
2,Liked 100%
2,Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.
2,Our family really loves this new Echo
2,bought for my wife she loves it
2,Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.
2,Like it to do more
2,"This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc."
2,Listen music and set timer
2,I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!
2,Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!
2,Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.
2,"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller."
2,Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!
2,"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade."
2,"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them"
2,"I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music."
2,Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.
2,Enjoyed entire echo experience
2,Easy to set up.
2,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me."
2,We are loving Ours very much
2,"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you"
2,"Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered."
2,"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"
2,Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.
2,Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!
2,"I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!"
2,Arrived as expected.
2,"Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard."
2,Terrific
2,Love my Echo
2,It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.
2,Works great!
2,"My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!"
2,"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights."
2,I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.
2,We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.
2,See subject line.  Love it
2,Love it!
2,Very easy setup.
2,"I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!"
2,Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!
2,Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.
2,I love it!!
2,Works great! Perfect for my office!
2,Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -
2,easy to use--amazing
2,Nice product A+
2,We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn’t buy two since we got it on Prime day!
2,Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.
2,It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...
2,"I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account."
2,Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!
2,Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it
2,"I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product."
2,Great addition to my Echo Plus!
2,the best
2,Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.
2,I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.
2,I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it
2,Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.
2,Very easy to set up and have no issues.
2,This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)
2,It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.
2,"Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far."
2,Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.
2,"Love it, love it!!!!!!!!"
2,Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps
2,I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information
2,"it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works."
2,"This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock.."
2,"Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color."
2,Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.
2,"Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!"
2,"Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover."
2,"I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money."
2,Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home
2,"Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off."
2,Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!
2,We got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!
2,I am impressed with the sound quality.
2,"Very pleased with my purchase of Echo Smart Speaker - love the fact that I can play music of different genre's whenever I want.Had some trouble at first with the WI FI, but it is now working."
2,"My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home."
2,"This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music."
2,The sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions
2,"This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great."
2,great sound
2,Great
2,We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.
2,"Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet."
2,Very easy set up. Really enjoying it
2,"The echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient."
2,more compact and a bit better than the original
2,I love it pretty cool.
2,I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.
2,This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.
2,"So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good."
2,Love it
2,Love it.
2,Glad I bought this.
2,"Like, all types of fun,music, and more"
2,I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.
2,Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it
2,"I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie"
2,Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.
2,"Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!"
2,"I’m still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!"
2,Works awesome!
2,Works great.
2,From such a small speaker it sounds great
2,Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!
2,if you don't have an Echo you definitely need one
2,Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!
2,I love the Echo Dot. So easy. So fun. I get to drop in on my Grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. Sounds like she is right next to me.
2,Works great no different than the new ones
2,This one's going in the kitchen for timer/music duty.
2,"Love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. If it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo. Proved to be best way to go."
2,Works just fine.
2,Works great! Looks brand new! Love my new echo dot. I will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house.
2,"For a refurbished item.. It works like its new... Which I love... Easy set up,  which I love. The only issue is the volume,  if you are listening while relaxing its fine,  but if you are expecting to do anything else,  I recommend  purchasing a speaker."
2,But not very loud
2,This is our 2nd one and we love it!
2,"So i am not sure how i feel about the echo dot, it's so many things that i need to get used to you have to ask her the right questions or she won't understand you."
2,Gift for my man. He doesn’t like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord. Would prefer it cordless. Still works though for the purpose we bought it.
2,"This is our 5th Amazon Echo device.  We have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied, this time is no different.  You can't tell this from brand new, and the price was $10 cheaper.  Our Echo's wake us up, keep timers, play music for us, act as encyclopedias, turn our lights on and off and so much more."
2,"This small echo dot is amazing the sounds that come out are great.it changes my nest thermostat,and my Phillips hue lights.without leaving my chair."
2,We talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can . There aren’t dislikes about this device.
2,I’m never disappointed with amazons technology.
2,Worked as promised.
2,Has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices.
2,I sure love Alexa!  LOL!  Thank you!  Great price and product!
2,It works
2,Bought for my bathroom to listen when I'm in the shower.  Love it.
2,Fast shipping and works well
2,I Love it!!!!
2,LOVE LOVE LOVE my new and free assistant!  :)
2,"Six words, &#34;Alexa, tell me a poop joke.&#34;"
2,Refurbished is the way to go. My Echo works just like new.
2,love it
2,We have five of them. Need I say more?
2,The speakers arent too loud.. alexa is great though. Besides that naw
2,It works great and sounds good!
2,Almost like having Star Trek in your home!  Fun to try and outsmart !
2,"This was an add on for my echo system, the refurbished product works like new!"
2,"Great for my office. I use this daily in many ways, to include spelling for me and background music."
2,Awesome. I love Alexa.
2,"I wasn't sure I really wanted one of these, but now that I have it, it is extremely useful.  Get one, you'll love it!"
2,Great Product fast shipping
2,Perfect works great no problems with it being refurbished.
2,Perfect condition! I love my echo
2,Love it. Beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories.
2,"We just got this within the last couple of weeks, from what we can tell no issues! My son wanted and &#34;alexa&#34; for his 6th birthday so she could tell him jokes, he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more. We all enjoy this one so much that I just bought a second one this week during Prime Deals Day!"
2,Divertido
2,Great product and works great
2,"Bought this for the guest room.  It's a radio, alarm clock, information​ center and so much more."
2,Great buy. Bought this to go with my Echo and love it. The speaker isn’t the best for music but works great in a kitchen for timers or alarms.
2,Works perfect. Save a few bucks and buy the refurbished. Looks brand new.
2,Looks and works perfect. Glad I got a good deal.
2,Just as good as the new one I bought but $10.00 less.
2,I love it works very well
2,everything perfect
2,Good price. Prompt shipping. Has been working flawlessly.
2,"I love you, Alexa!"
2,"There's room for improvement on this. For the price, I cannot complain too much. I can still complain however, the audio is terrible. This is kind of like listening to a speak-n-spell from the 80s."
2,Iove it I bought it for my son because he wanted it and it’s awesome
2,"It's an echo, and it works.  For the price it's great deal. Have had no issues with it.  As with all dots, the speaker is a bit tinny, but good for a second unit, or if you are like me, you can attach it to an external speaker for more sound.Good buy"
2,Thanks
2,This is my third Dot. They all work perfectly and I use each one multiple times a day. Absolutely love them.
2,I already have the echo plus.  Bought this one for my bedroom.  Love the functions.
2,Simple set up.  Music everywhere.
2,Worked just like a brand new Dot ---so I am very satisfied.
2,We have a few echos already. Went for this one in refurbished to save a few bucks. It works great. I love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom - nice.
2,"I love the fact, that I can unplug it, and take it to my basement when I want do laundry."
2,Refurbished but just as good as the new ones that I've bought.
2,Good as new
2,Granddaughter loves it
2,"The price is great.  Was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room, but after moving it to another spot, it seems to be working fine.  Will buy some more. Want 1 in every room."
2,We have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  Can't wait to try more new stuff using Alexa!
2,Thanks
2,Works great!
2,Started here with Amazon productsAnd I regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day-to-day life
2,Have now used for several months without problem.
2,This is my first smart device and I will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.
2,Love
2,Love it just as good as a new one
2,Have had an larger echo for some time and love it. Bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house.
2,Love the product.  Use to turn on my lights and answer some quick questions.
2,A great buy
2,Was Leary about refurbished but work great.
2,"Very puny sound, but works great."
2,Great
2,"Exactly like new, can tell the difference from my new dot I got prior to this one, works perfectly. LOVE Alexa"
2,Works perfect no wear and tear on the device I love Alexa working on making my home smart 😂
2,Works good
2,The only thing I don't like is it shuts off by itself other than that it works great
2,"Excellent product, mint condition for a refurbished unit - you would never know it's been refurbished!"
2,"Already owning a couple of Echos, I was frustrated that I couldn’t also use them as intercoms. Finally Amazon enables the “drop-in” feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It's not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones."
2,Love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. It is awesome have used it for everything my lights since I work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify. And planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young... I would recommend this to everyone!!!!
2,Love Alexa hope have her in every room soon.
2,The simplicity of use and setting up.
2,This is great! Got one for my Gazebo and one upstairs.
2,"Works great, never had any issues."
2,Does everything I have asked it.
2,Works great ..good sound
2,"I use this Echo to listen to music as well as a sort-of research tool. It can answer a variety of questions. I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can't complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source. In order to use the Echo, it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord. It would be nice to use the Echo Dot on the go without having to buy the other product."
2,Love it!  Great fun!
2,Love it!
2,outstanding I use all the time....works just like they say
2,"saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected."
2,"Works perfectly, Alexa turns on and off my lights, my tv, roomba!"
2,Never would know it was refurbished.
2,So far so good
2,Looks and performs as new.  No complaints!
2,goes great with our echo
2,Works great just like the new one that i already had.
2,"Very fast service,  got what I ordered. Thank you"
2,Love it even though I’m still trying to figure out all the other things I can do with this item it works great with my phone.
2,"I have 2 Echos, one I bought brand new and the other is a refurbished one.Honestly, I can't tell the difference in performance and looks."
2,A GREAT PRODUCT...once we learned how to work it...this thing is awesome!!!
2,It works
2,"Love it. Though, wish it was portable."
2,of course!
2,You could not tell this was refurbished. Works Excellent. I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.
2,I got this for my mom . She loves it !
2,I love my echo dot! Looks brand new and works perfect! Very satisfied.
2,Same as new
2,"A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited..."
2,"I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv."
2,I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected
2,"So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed."
2,It arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant
2,"Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha"
2,Love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn't done and has already taken weeks.
2,"The refurbished echo for has been wonderful. I purchased this for my mother. She loves the ability to contact me without a phone, listen to music, weather, and ask questions. It's been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems"
2,"Works good. However, the price went down the week after I purchased it."
2,Works amazingly. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.
2,"I love Alexa! It's great helping me, making my appointments, playing the songs I like! What else can you do? Looking forward for more."
2,Got this for the bathroom love it we can listen music whe. We showering.
2,I have 3-Dots and 2-Original and this new one works perfectly.  Will buy all my future Dots reconditioned.
2,Was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all
2,There's really no dislike for Alexa( dot) I thought cortna was cool but Alexa is an awesome application to the family. Unbelievable device which seems alive. A must get.
2,"I am happy with the refurbished echo dot. I’ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it is working perfectly! Even though it did not come in its original box, it looks like new! I’m happy with this purchase!"
2,Thumbs up!
2,Workreat
2,Works as expected!
2,No problems
2,Have these in almost every room. I really have enjoyed them. Works perfectly.
2,Purchased for grandson.
2,Like new
2,Happy with this as I was with the other 2 I ordered!!
2,"Love the dots, especially with the ability to talk from one to the other, these are really convenient. No issues with the refurbished as they are like new."
2,"Started taking on her own! Haven’t used it since I unplugged it that day. No one was talking, my daughter was laying in bed next to be and she just started going on about the movie Moana and completely scared the sh*t out of my daughter now."
2,It works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend
2,Great! Just like new!
2,"Loved the price for an essentially brand new Dot!! Opening it, you really couldn’t tell that it was refurbished. Everything looked brand new. For $20 less than a new unit, I couldn’t consider this a better deal! I really love the versatility of the echo dot. Get you one while you can!"
2,Pleased with the order just what I wanted!!
2,"I think I now have 5 of these throughout the house. So convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever, wherever."
2,Love it -- the best.  My experience with refurbished devices is excellent.
2,Love the echo dot
2,"This refurbished item was fine,but I wasn't aware that there is a fee for having other echos set up in the rooms.  However, it was missing the cordThank you"
2,It worked like a brandnew unit! Great addition to my collection.
2,"Great price, works perfectly. Saved the money on a refurb!! Would buy again!"
2,Very.god
2,These are great. I bought one and then bought another right away. Grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you're set with smart home capabilities for under $150. Highly recommended.
2,Just like new
2,"Worked as it should, still need to figure out how to link to other devices though, only set up Sonos which was pretty easy. Not the products fault, just have not had time to figure it out."
2,Very useful
2,"Works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.  Audio quality is okay for the size."
2,I bought two refurbished ones for work and home. They both work perfectly and appear brand new
2,Amazon doesn't disappoint.
2,Works great as a BT receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment.
2,"Working great this far.  Can't tell it's not new.  Will edit for longevity in a year, that's the real test."
2,Amazing
2,i love everything
2,"This used “dot” works fine, it compliments my Echo."
2,Works like a new one.  Can tell the difference from the new one I bough and the refurbished one.
2,Well I’m a big fan of echoes these ones went I’m my bathrooms.  Works just great as expected 👍🏾
2,Purchased for my 83 year old mother-she loves talking to Alexa! Very responsive-can detect its “name” from all over the room.
2,This is just like new -- same performance as our brand new one; no problems.
2,Love it.  Great product
2,it works good.  very satisfied
2,"I love Alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there’s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it’s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also."
2,"Took me awhile to get it connected. I'm not electronically savy but now that it is, I love it."
2,Absolutely love it!
2,Second Dot work great for refurbishedThought it was new
2,Love these guys they work so great
2,"I love this as a second &#34;Alexa&#34; in our bedroom.  Great for checking weather, for meditation music, and as a timer - Perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for 5 minutes."
2,I purchased this refurbished.  Works just like brand new.  3 minute set up. Very easy.  Now I have echo dot that I can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system.
2,Not substitute for the original.  The echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  To listen it has to be at the highest level 10.
2,Love the Echo Dot. Helps husband get Netflix and other apps on our Amazon Fire TV.  No problems with it being refurbished. Planning on getting another one for the Amazon Fire Stick in bedroom.
2,"Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you."
2,I like my uncle. But sometime it goes a little Haywire
2,"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me."
2,I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.
2,Worked like new.  Will do it again.
2,Good as new!! Just like brand new! Save yourself some money. Get one!
2,Adding more rooms for convenience
2,"Nice. It works good.Some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming."
2,"I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn't be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box! If I didn't discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny!"
2,Alexa's sister (my second dot)
2,"Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.  Both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things.  I love it as an alarm every morning or whenever.  I love it to play music or sounds of the ocean, or nature sounds when I am trying to sleep.  Just love it for so many things."
2,"Bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones I bought prior! Came in original packaging as well!"
2,Love it. It's like having a second wife.
2,Works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished.
2,"Works great, can't tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode.  I have 3 in my home and will be adding more. I love these things."
2,Worked just as good as the two new Echo Dots i preciously purchases.
2,I bought this for my mother and she is in love with it.She loves the guard dog feature.She says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house
2,I bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone. Not working for me. Read instructions but not working for me.
2,It works
2,"Bought two of them and both work great. I'm not much on electronics running my home, but Alexa does all that I want and need to be done."
2,2nd one... more to come
2,Blue light blinks all the time
2,Fun and useful. We're still learning new tricks and useful functionalities. This is the future of human to computer interface and household automation. Just like Star Trek! Who knew it would be here so soon?
2,"Works great to control the TV lights and various other devices. Lately I've been using it when i wake up and don't know what time it is but don't want to open my eyes. Just shout out &#34;Alexa, What time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it'd be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. The Echo Plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive Echo."
2,Works great!
2,Wasn't sure if I'd like this product but after having it for a little while I want one in every room! My daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words. We've barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and I'm looking forward to learning all of its capabilities!
2,A++++
2,Great product. Works well
2,Absolutly love it !
2,Bought my first echo dot and loved it so I got this for work. Absolutely love it!
2,works as promised
2,Works great with my existing smart home setup.
2,Perfect. Could not tell the difference from a new one.
2,Good sometimes can’t hear well
2,"I was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product, but with Amazon's guarantee, thought I would try it. Glad I did, and will probably buy another refurb product form Amazon. I love the Alexa products and have several. This one sits on my desk. Has a small footprint, but has great sound and I use it daily. Works great."
2,Not bad bad speaker for sound
2,"This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything."
2,We all love her!
2,I purchased this for my daughter and we all love this!!!! its amazing!! we love the games!
2,Good as new! Perfectly packaged and I have had zero issues with the dot.
2,Love it! Bought for my granddaughter who is 3 for her to play music and ask questions. She is entertained for hours! Good buy in my honest opinion!
2,No issues...works and looks great!!!
2,This is a fun toy.  My daughter have me it.  It reads to me!
2,"Refurbish Echo Dot received as new condition, as new packaging, no complaints. Neat little gadget.(Drives my wife nuts!)"
2,"I received an Echo as a gift, loved it so much I decided to get the Dot for my bedroom. Both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality. I would still buy it again."
2,Worked as advertised. Thanks
2,Works good.  Microphone is not as good as the better Echo products
2,Took a little work to set up but I finally got it.  Sound quality not the best but for what I got it for it works great.  I check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  I do play the radio on it when I want some music but will probably upgrade to the Echo plus for better sound.
2,Love Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don't know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to
2,I loved it it works great
2,"I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don't know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL."
2,"Purchased as a gift,"
2,Love it
2,"Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker."
2,Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.
2,The voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)
2,Worked perfect
2,"Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist."
2,I bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren't labeled as refurbished I wouldn't have known
2,"This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn’t think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren’t tech savvy."
2,Great little thing. Works better than siri.
2,It’s amazing I love it
2,Bought this for my son and he loves it.
2,"I own the first and second generation Echo Dot.  I think I prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price I got it for.  I'd still definitely recommend."
2,Very fun to use and having morning briefing
2,Arrived on time and works amazing!!!
2,"Just like new, set-up was quick & easy."
2,"like new, good refurbishing"
2,Love it
2,Love my echo dot!!!
2,I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.
2,great product!
2,"It works great, but the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available."
2,Works great!
2,I love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.
2,"The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I’d set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I’ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended."
2,Es perfecto.
2,Working good so far.
2,Working great and my daughter loves it!
2,Works great
2,I love it
2, 
2,WORKS GREAT
2,Amazing!
2,Great product
2,Works perfectly
2,Perfect
2,Overall it works very well. Some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!
2,Have had no issues with this refurbished unit. It performed expected. I would buy another one if needed.
2,Great for mom its inside an owlhead in her jacuzzi
2,Works great - I put this in my son's room and use the drop in option to get his attention when he is gaming or watching tv.
2,It was perfect
2,It looked brand nrw!! I have nothing to.complain about!! I will defently be ordering more
2,I love it!
2,"I love this, answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when I don’t get off the couch"
2,Bought this to go in my niece's room. You can't tell it's refurbished. It looks good and works like new.
2,Best price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions. It is so handy to not have to find your phone. I also now have an intercom system.
2,I have never been more satisfied with a product. Perfect introduction to Alexa.
2,"Works well, but the speaker is not so grand. Getting another speaker to drop this into. In the future I would have just gone with the full size echo."
2,Love our echo! Thing the full size version sounds better though.
2,Works great!
2,It has all I need for my life plans time date music
2,Seems to have trouble hearing me when I say the wake word despite being trained to my voice... Wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished. Our google home mini has no problems hearing us 😬 and is much louder.
2,Love it!  Works perfectly!
2,I had a brand new echo Dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. It was quite different from my expectations. Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.
2,I bought this for a family member as a gift. I called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it‼️
2,"Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. Sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you’re trying to use for hosting a louder party"
2,Looked Brand new works great. I love these echo dots and the refurbished ones are like new
2,My 2nd one and I use them all the time.
2,"Is working like a  new one for now, l have another 3 alexa devices lm a fanatic"
2,Echo is good.
2,Works great
2,Great price to extend the range and super value to dot offers. Hooked up wireless speaker to use working outside.This dot made outdoor sound range possible without disturbing indoor light control possible
2,"Amazingly fun. My daughter and I just asked questions on the first day. I have now set my daily alarm, weekend reminder, playlist, morning shows, random songs, daily bible verses, weather, and morning commute. It tells me which way to go dodging traffic. You have to get one. I don’t have it linked to my phone yet."
2,Works perfect! There’s no difference at all between this refurb one and my new ones that I have in my house. I’ll be buying the refurbs from here on out
2,Great product. Wakes me up every morning on time!
2,Like new.  No difference from new unused original.
2,"I have no complaints. As far as I know, these are exactly like new, just a little cheaper. Great!"
2,Perfect condition!
2,Like new
2,It works just as well as the new version I got as a discount with my Echo speaker. I decided to purchase this version because Amazon states it has the same warranty.
2,"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do."
2,"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."
2,I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.
2,looks great
2,"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!"
2,"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."
2,I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times
2,"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!"
2,"Love, Love, Love!!"
2,Just what I expected....
2,"I love it, wife hates it."
2,Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.
2,We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.
2,We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound
2,"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"
2,Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.
2,"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying."
2,"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at."
2,I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask
2,"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."
2,Amazing product
2,"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge."
2,Sounds great!! Love them!
2,"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."
2,Just like the other one
2,Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good
2,I like it
2,"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great"
2,The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.
2,This device is awesome!
2,I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.
2,"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube."
2,Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo
2,"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is."
2,"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!"
2,My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities
2,"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running."
2,So far so good
2,Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.
2,Great
2,Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.
2,Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.
2,I love you so much
2,No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .
2,"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español."
2,"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting."
2,Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.
2,The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.
2,like google better
2,Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.
2,Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.
2,Great sound and easy to set up.
2,"Love Alexa, bought others for friends"
2,Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs
2,😍
2,Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available
2,"Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview"
2,Love this just wish it had a built in hub
2,I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!
2,How easy if was to set up.
2,Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.
2,You’re all I need...na na nana!
2,Does everything as expected and more.
2,"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good."
2,Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.
2,Works and sounds great.
2,The sound is amazing and many collections of all music
2,Setting up
2,She doesn’t always listen
2,It’s awesome
2,"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located."
2,The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!
2,I LIKE IT ALL
2,I love it. It does everything
2,I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!
2,I like it and still learning how to use it.
2,Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!
2,"I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!"
2,Works fine!!
2, 
2,Clear music
2,"Fun to use, good sound quality"
2,The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.
2,"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo."
2,Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!
2,The speaker sounds really good
2,Good sound works well
2,Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.
2,"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music."
2,"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet."
2,Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!
2,"Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc."
2,Love it!
2,The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.
2,"Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more"
2,Love it!
2,"awesome thing, love Alexa"
2,It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!
2,"LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!"
2,The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.
2,Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!
2,I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.
2,"It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better."
2,The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.
2,"Great device, responsive and helpful"
2,"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that."
2,Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.
2,Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.
2,"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product."
2,"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!"
2,It's Alexa.... what else can you say
2,Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound
2,"Excellent product, set up with ease as well."
2,I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.
2,I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.
2,wonderful product and fast delivery!
2,Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.
2,It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!
2,Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.
2,How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .
2,Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.
2,Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.
2,"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well."
2,Love our echo
2,"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her."
2,"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it."
2,I love having an Alexa!
2,So far I like it 🤓
2,I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.
2,Still love it
2,Love it
2,"I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound."
2,I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.
2,"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him."
2,"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool."
2,Cool
2,Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.
2,it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself
2,I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.
2,"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title."
2,I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.
2,The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.
2,"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music."
2,Love it
2,awesome.understands my kids
2,We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.
2,Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.
2,"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music."
2,"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries."
2,This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!
2,"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"
2,Versatile and fun !!!
2,Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.
2,We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.
2,so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app
2,"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?"
2,Easy to set up.
2,I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected
2,A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.
2,Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!
2,"I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call."
2,Good Value
2,Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!
2,Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa
2,BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.
2,Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.
2,Sound quality
2,Entertainment
2,Very good quality
2,Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability
2,Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.
2,Alexa rocks
2,"Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes."
2, 
2,"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without."
2,Love it!! Great product!!!
2,Easy set up very user friendly
2,I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.
2,Everything
2,I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.
2,Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.
2,I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!
2,Love it!  So do the grandkids!!
2,"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it."
2,Works as advertised
2,I love it!
2,"Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too."
2,"Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather."
2,As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.
2,A great device
2,I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..
2,Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!
2,Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.
2,Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!
2,We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.
2,Amazing paroduct
2,Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.
2,speaker sounds good
2,Absolutely love!!
2,The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.
2,We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.
2,Home entertainment
2,"Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated."
2,"Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use..."
2,"Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well."
2,Great sound from a little speaker
2,We enjoy it
2, 
2,Cool
2,"Good quality, great sound quality"
2,Works perfectly
2,"Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker."
2,Love my Echo great sound very smart!
2,Sure did !! Love it !!
2,plays great
2,Works absolutely great
2,Very amazing product. Great sound quality.
2,Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁
2,"I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it."
2,"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!"
2,"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!"
2,I like everything about it !!!
2,Liked 100%
2,Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.
2,Our family really loves this new Echo
2,bought for my wife she loves it
2,Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.
2,Like it to do more
2,"This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc."
2,Listen music and set timer
2,I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!
2,Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!
2,Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.
2,"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller."
2,Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!
2,"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade."
2,"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them"
2,"I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music."
2,Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.
2,Enjoyed entire echo experience
2,Easy to set up.
2,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me."
2,We are loving Ours very much
2,"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you"
2,"Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered."
2,"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"
2,Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.
2,Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!
2,"I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!"
2,Arrived as expected.
2,"Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard."
2,Terrific
2,Love my Echo
2,It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.
2,Works great!
2,"My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!"
2,"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights."
2,I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.
2,We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.
2,See subject line.  Love it
2,Love it!
2,Very easy setup.
2,"I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!"
2,Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!
2,Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.
2,I love it!!
2,Works great! Perfect for my office!
2,Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -
2,easy to use--amazing
2,Nice product A+
2,We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn’t buy two since we got it on Prime day!
2,Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.
2,It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...
2,"I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account."
2,Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!
2,Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it
2,"I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product."
2,Great addition to my Echo Plus!
2,the best
2,Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.
2,I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.
2,I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it
2,Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.
2,Very easy to set up and have no issues.
2,This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)
2,It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.
2,"Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far."
2,Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.
2,"Love it, love it!!!!!!!!"
2,Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps
2,I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information
2,"it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works."
2,"This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock.."
2,"Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color."
2,Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.
2,"Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!"
2,"Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover."
2,"I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money."
2,Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home
2,"Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off."
2,Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!
2,We got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!
2,I am impressed with the sound quality.
2,"Very pleased with my purchase of Echo Smart Speaker - love the fact that I can play music of different genre's whenever I want.Had some trouble at first with the WI FI, but it is now working."
2,"My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home."
2,"This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music."
2,The sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions
2,"This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great."
2,great sound
2,Great
2,We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.
2,"Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet."
2,Very easy set up. Really enjoying it
2,"The echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient."
2,more compact and a bit better than the original
2,I love it pretty cool.
2,I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.
2,This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.
2,"So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good."
2,Love it
2,Love it.
2,Glad I bought this.
2,"Like, all types of fun,music, and more"
2,I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.
2,Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it
2,"I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie"
2,Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.
2,"Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!"
2,"I’m still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!"
2,Works awesome!
2,Works great.
2,From such a small speaker it sounds great
2,Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!
2,if you don't have an Echo you definitely need one
2,Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!
2,Very useful
2,Great Prime Day Buy!
2,I love Alexa!
2,Alexa is easy to operate and set up.  Have had it for about 10 days now and love it.
2,Great speaker with a lot of capabilities. Very fun to learn how to use it.
2,I used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos
2,"Don’t use it for much as I thought we would. Synced with Kasa-Cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot. Lyrics for music is cool, too. Other than that it’s used as a clock and standard dot’ish features."
2,Amazing so far. Just got it the other day.
2,"I like that it's smaller, but it has never understood commands as easily as our first-gen original Echo did."
2,"Worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock.  However, for the price it should come with the stand"
2,"I love this device! All the functionality of an Amazon Echo with the added benefit of a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. I think it can do video calls too but I use FaceTime for that anyway. It’s a great shape and doesn’t take up a lot of room. I’m planning to get another one for my guest room. Awesome for a great price!"
2,I love the Echo Spot. This bedside alarm clock size device can do what theEcho Show can do. I was concerned because I already had a large Echo in mybedroom that answered to “Alexa” like the other devices in my home. I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him “Echo.” Now if I could only choose a male voice. I loved that I could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. So many more features. Don’t forget to buy thestand/base. So many advantages to having that. Read the reviews. Highly recommend.
2,"I love this little Spot more than I thought I would. The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won’t connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner. Of course, if it was CORDLESS I could just bring it with me...otherwise, I absolutely love it and will probably buy another one!"
2,"I bought on Prime Day and so glad I did. It’s easy to use and lots of customization options. I know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read, but I disagree."
2,"Overall it's great and I like that I can see lyrics and the time and  date. However, sometimes it freezes and doesn't respond properly--no error message about lack of connectivity--it just stops. Resetting resolves the problem."
2,I love all that you can do with the Echo Spot!
2,The thing I like most about my Echo Spot is the voice command feature.  You can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the Echo. Easy to use
2,"Love it!! Perfect for an alarm clock replacement, plus so much more!!"
2,"I love the Echo Spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!"
2,We absolutely love this product!!! Wish we would have bought this instead of the dots!!!
2,"We like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  You can even hear music played. The speaker is clear.  We are enjoying it.  What we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  The next day, I asked the Echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  The Echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  It was a little disconcerting."
2,"I like echo spot. I bought it to use as an alarm clock. One negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. In this case a clock with buttons seems to work better"
2,This is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.
2,Love my Echo Spot!
2,I love the way it is designed. And you have choices for the face.  I use it for my bed side.  I drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.
2,"Terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. I like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking Alexa. Not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen."
2,New to Alexa. Like this spot a lot.
2,"It's not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What's not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions."
2,I love it.  It is so easy to use
2,Put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.
2,Love it
2,"Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it."
2,Very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone.
2,I love my new Echo Spot!
2,"I love this clock, I just have to tell it to set my alarm.  No more fussing with buttons!"
2,Couldn't be more pleased. Amazon hit this one out of the park. Looks great and runs great. Love it!
2,Responds easily and like the ability to do at night.
2,Easy setup  Love it!
2,"Simply amazing what a awsome device. It never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. Drop in on the kids and keep in touch. I have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do."
2,"I was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  It looks good, so far.  I did, however, turn off the camera."
2,Sound quality is disappointing.
2,I love it!  I especially love that it is so small and does so much.  Got rid of my old CD/Alarm clock radio.  Much more room on nightstand.
2,Great sound and video plus all the great stuff that Alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off
2,The ease to use product
2,"So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good."
2,"I am just entering the &#34;smart&#34; technology world. I haven't figured it all out yet, but so far it's pretty cool!"
2,"It was smaller than I had anticipated, and when I say that I very much mean it. However, it still works very well! Quality sound, easily programmed, easy to work with, but Alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs."
2,Love my Echo Spot!
2,"Great deal, great product!"
2,Perfect
2,"i had a couple of echo dots previously - bought these _SPECIFICALLY_ for the Ring doorbell video / cloud cam display / interface capabilities. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Love the fact that I can ask to see front yard / back yard / front door, etc.the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool.BONUS: “Alexa show me Ant Man trailer, etc”i know this can all be done on laptop/desktop, but it’s cool now having an ‘appliance’ that’s always just there, and it doesn’t interrupt what i’m doing."
2,"Bought this for my bedroom and the Show for my living room. Love them both. The Spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design. Shows lyrics, photos , etc. I paired it with a Smart Plug for the bedroom lamps &#34;Alexa, turn off lights&#34;, love it."
2,Love that is can do so much! It sits on my nightstand! Only improvements I would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger. But overall I’m happy I have it! Would recommend!
2,It was a gift and the recipient love love loves it 😍💋💋💋💋❤!
2,"Cool little piece of tech...we’re still learning some of its functions and possibilities, but I can see some potential.  Even my ‘technically challenged’ wife already figured out how to video call our daughter."
2,"I have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole. Completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock. It is the perfect bedside counter device - alarm, wake up music, weather, top news stories, etc. Perfect device for what I wanted and does so much more than I expected it to do, calling feature is also a huge selling point. This is a must own item. Probably will grab more Echos in the future."
2,So far so good.
2,"This device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. I love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. Its the first nightstand clock I have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. The screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.Overall a great addition to my smart home. Its nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. I have a bunch of other Alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen."
2,"I love this thing. I talk to it through walls and in other rooms. I have been an amazon lover for a while so I have amazon music unlimited, kindle unlimited, prime video, etc., so I was ready for this when it came out. The screen is just so nice to have.The only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn't always perfectly understand which song I want to hear, but I do have a deep southern accent, lower Alabama, so I don't speak English anyways."
2,Smaller than I thought it would be. Happy I got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table.
2,Echo Spot works well except it does not work with the Ring doorbell as it states on the website. Since they were sold as a pair I thought that it would be app ready.  Unfortunately that is not case.  Perhaps Ring will update so that they can be integrated.
2,Nice
2,I like it
2,"We've owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven't found much use for them.  We just don't find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks."
2,I love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.
2,"I like how small it is, but I’m still able to see my Ring cameras."
2,Great for checking in on my son after school when I'm still at work.  Love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so I can plan my route accordingly
2,Love it!! Super fun! Easy to use! My three year old even gets involved
2,"I am a hardcore fan of Echo. Infact I am in love with all members of my Alexa family. I have Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and now this new toddler Echo Spot. Every variant has its own beauty. I love feel and size of Echo Spot. It’s fabulous as far as looks are concerned. It does not have great Audio quality (which I did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size). I bought it to connect with my Bose SoundTouch."
2,Love this!
2,I love being able to have Alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up.
2,"Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn't work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn't as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who's at the front door.  But, it's great for the bedside."
2,Fun tech toy
2,Love it. Small with good sound
2,"With the combination of this, smart plugins, and the Alex app I can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling Alexa to do it. I can order stuff, get answers, watch videos, get weather, set alarms, video call, and so much more with this device!"
2,Great product
2,"In a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. Extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. Would love to have a voice personalization. Some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. So far only positive experience. The privacy invasions is happened way before Alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. To Alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off."
2,"I love this device! It's so great. What a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing YouTube videos, and Google play music. The camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it's dark in the room.Other than those minor things, I love it. Great buy and would buy again"
2,Hands free control
2,"Great love the display and easy to use, though still learning what all it can do everyday."
2,"It has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start, even from a distance. A lot of the skills are excellent. I've added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it's ridiculous that it can't access YouTube.It might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task; it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event. I imagine this is a functionality people would use often."
2,Setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock
2,"Great product! Highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it, it sits much better on the desk."
2,Eh it’s cool and all but also kinda boring I don’t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. I can’t connect to my Spotify unless it’s premium and I’m in college and I’m not paying or that or amazon music so
2,I am huge Amazon fan! First to have a kindle and the echo. I waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. I do love it!! My kids love it! They love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. Now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. I thought as long as someone would FaceTime me I could do it through that and I can’t. It’s Spot to Spot. Can’t even Skype (which I do often with my aunt). The is my major disappointment with it.
2,LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn't pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house). I have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. I'm no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!
2,Love my Amazon products
2,Love this
2,"Love my spot. Have that , a dot, and a regular echo"
2,Nice upgrade from an Echo Dot.
2,"Works decent, wish it was able to answer more questions....need a better source for info but the rest works great!"
2,I can't live without Alexa.
2,Really like it. The screen is a major plus.
2,"Didnt think id get an Alexa device, but this is perfect for my home office.  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other Alexa devices.  It can show lyrics of songs, play my xm radio, can show videos of movie trailers and news.  Its great!"
2,I love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..
2,"It's fun to use, and makes my life easier in some sense."
2,Love it!
2, 
2,"I got my Echo Spot on Prime Day and love it. I think it still is a little expensive, but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it. I basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. I also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. I'm still exploring the other skills...just discovered some Star Trek sounds (Alexa, beam me up) which are fun!"
2,Love this! Replaced an old alarm clock in my bedroom with this.  Love that it dims at night. Very responsive to commands.
2,Love my spot! She even more than I expected! Great size for a bedroom!
2,So far so good. Just got it and I am trying to figure out all the things it can do. The product itself is very well made.. And easy to set up.
2,"Perfect! May favorite Alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam's it does the job really well.  We changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive. Good job Amazon!"
2,Is great. Use it for music mostly.
2,It won’t receive calls and it’s really hard to call someone who has another echo.
2,This is our first step into a smart home. Soon as I added one item to the grocery list I started loving it. My wife was so-so about it ‘til I opened rain sounds. She’s a convert. 😉 LOVE these and the dots.
2,"Like the little spot,  now our guest room is Alexa enabled."
2,We love our echo spots. We now have three through the house and like that you can drop in on the other spots. We do wish the clock faces had more customization options and that there were more faces in general.
2,It’s very smart and sweet design
2,so far just ok
2,Love this for bedside clock/alarm/radio.  Face can dimat night so it’s not bright for sleeping.
2,Love this product I use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options. The only thing I would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on it's own. Like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode.
2,Love this. So glad I purchased
2,I wanted to see my security video cameras without having to use my phone. Works great and extremely easy to set up.
2,The Echo Spot is great!
2,We bot 2 on Prime day one for use as a clock/radio in the bedroom and one in the family room to control lights and watch the front door when the doorbell rings.  Music sound is very good not as good as the Echo but way better than our Dots.  If we could only buy 1 Amazon device it would be the Spot.
2,I bought two one for my office and one for my bedside table. They are fantastic the screen is just big enough when using the drop in feature to communicate with my mom. I can’t wait for prime day again to get one for my moms bedside table.
2,"Fantastic product, absolutely love it!"
2,Love these!
2,I do like the product we bought it on Prime day but this week it was $30 cheaper then Prime day. Still a really cool device. I wish I would have waited.
2,still learning how to ise it but is DOES NOT disappoint. I’m giving to everyone for Christmas so I can “check in” on them unnannounced like they do me...just show up with no advanced warning!!!
2,Very helpful with daily activities
2,Exactly as advertised
2,Its very nice
2,"More than I expected. I use it for timers, alarms, shopping lists, calendar events, news, weather, and so much more."
2,Great!
2,I really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is fun.Sometimes it misunderstands what I say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol.
2,Fun to work with still learning everything she can do
2,Awesome. I love that it shows the lyrics of songs!
2,Love the alarm feature...just tell what time.
2,I think the dot listens better than spot.
2,Had a dot and upgraded to this! I like it. My only complaint is the very short instructions
2,"Big step up from the Dot! Dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up Ring Pro video, though looks great once the feed is displayed."
2,Easy set up and to use. I bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather. I set it up for him a gave him a 15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it’s is great to be able to see him in between visits.
2,Great size for bedside. Plus it dims at night!!
2,"I love it and it works great, the only issue is the “drop in” FaceTime like feature sometimes lags, but that could possibly be an issue with my WiFi for where we have it located in the house."
2,"Love to have meditation music, I use it as a morning alarm, just to mention few in general I love it"
2,"I don't know why I like it, but I do. It's like an all-in-one alarm clock.  If you have other alexa devices, you know what it is.  If you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  It shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  It's quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  It also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  The viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough."
2,Quick and easy to set up
2,I was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99
2,Great device
2,I’m a fan of echo devices. I think it’s a great alternative to a clean clock. I like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep. My two year old sleeps so much better with it on. We also use it to tell my two year old stories. Only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night
2,"I own 5 Echo devices, consider me addicted! This little number is awesome, not only do I like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other Echo devices. One feature I really like is how it slowly dims after I turn off my bedroom light, so I have a night light for a bit. I love Echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!"
2,I enjoy this little thing a lot.  Will do almost anything.  I like the jokes it tells.  I’m still learning different functions
2,Best looking Echo device. Easy to use
2,A helpful product with a few glitches eg inability to occasionally access all flash briefing stations and understand or answer certain questions but Amazon will likely fix and improve it.
2,we like it. very convenient
2,I love the size of the echo spot. It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It’s small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.
2,The amazon Alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the Alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen!
2,love the spot
2,Easy to use easy to set up
2,I love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday. Alexa wakes me each morning and plays music when I ask.
2,Great deal on prime day
2,no problem
2,Excelente su funcionamiento y llama la atención la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a través de la utilización con Alexa. Me sorprendió gratamente. Muy recomendable.
2,I love love it !
2,"Purchased this on Prime Day and I absolutely love it!  I had the Echo Dot on my nightstand, but I really missed a display. This is perfect and the speakers are excellent."
2,"Yes it met my expectations.  The snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  Tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  But without my glasses I can't read it and often it just snoozes.  Then one day I must have dismissed tomorrow's alarm because it never went off.  I have it set for Mon-Thu.  Fri I don't need to get up early.  A more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  My old alarm had a red light."
2,"Great product, and i like the screen for a alarm clock"
2,"Such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. No need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. The speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. The price is right for a device like this."
2,"A great replacement for the bedside alarm clock, which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through. We mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off, while leaving the fan running. Only gripe would be the mic sensitivity, which doesn't appear be as good as the View or Gen2. It can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself."
2,This product has made my life much simpler with a little one. I use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on/off or up/down is a breeze. The screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news!
2,Works well and was easy to set up.
2,"Love my spot, it now acts as my new alarm."
2,This is the one of my favorite Amazon devices.  Have one in my bedroom and use as alarm clock. Perfect addition to our home of Alexa devices.
2,"Wasn't so sure about bringing &#34;smart technology&#34; into my home, but I'm hooked! I love the sleek look of the Echo Spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use. I also love that it scrolls the news, local weather, and give suggestions of what to ask Alexa. I use this as my alarm clock, speaker, and have it sync'd with the Etekcity Voltson Wi-Fi Smart Plugs to control the lighting in my apartment."
2,Love it
2,Love it getting use to it and Alexa is getting use to my voice . Sometimes she doesn't answer but I think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn't strong. Over all I haven't had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about. Thank goodness I didn't listen to those reviews.  And paid attention to the Apple guy .
2,I used it as an alarm clock  i lov it
2,It was much smaller than I was expecting for the cost.
2,I’m amazed
2,Alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on Iheart radio or Spotify I want. Plus when I do get smart home devices she’ll be even more useful to me! She’s really helpful with answering random questions. The small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but it’s nice to have something to show time and pictures.
2,Fun so far...still learning how it all works
2,"I purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because I found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking, cutting, cleaning, etc. especially when our counters aren’t very wide to begin with. After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn’t watch a movie I’d been dying to see on this, it’s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching “Jaws” on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn’t as bad as one would think. I would definitely recommend!"
2,We love the echo spot I use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iHeartRadio radio while getting dressed!!
2,It was easy set up.  I use it more than I thought.
2,"I am a small business owner with no staff. With the Alexa driven Echo Spot, I feel like I've hired my first assistant! My Echo Spot keeps me organized, updated, and assistance when I need information that will help my day run more smoothly. I love my Echo Spot so much, I bought 2 more for my kids who love their Echo Spot too! I highly recommend this product.Suggested improvement for future versions, make the Echo Spot wireless. 😊"
2,"Bedroom clock , ask questions,  weather reportsAlarm clock ⏰. Music 🎶 download music"
2,Speakers are not as loud as Google Home
2,"I need to get some better controls for custom displays and the ability to make my own clock, but that's asking a lot. In general, great device; glad I got it."
2,Great buy!
2,"Gave it my daughter for her birthday, she loves it! Sound is amazing, she plays music on it constantly. Worth every penny. This is the third amazon device purchased, we have 2 echo shows and now the spot."
2,"I use the product as an alarm clock. I love being able to set my schedule for the week and not worry about it. When images are shown, they are cut off. Little because its trying to fit it into a circle."
2,Love the ease of use and convenience the echo spot has offered
2,"Love that I have command access to news such as Bloomberg TV, NPR, etc.Highly recommend that you gain access to Alexa app before setting up Device and get familiar with key features/services...such as setting up your daily commute.If family and friends have Spot...then it’s a great substitute for Skype and Face Time...you can always “drop in” when missing loved ones or just to catch up."
2,good size screen and gets good range for voice commands. sometimes it picks up weird commands when I'm watching tv though. Great product for the price if you don't need the big show screen.
2,"It is a good addition to my small space, and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions."
2,Best thing I have ever owned! Started with the dot and now added the spot and I love iy
2,I love it the coolest thing since sliced bread
2,"I got this for my husband on Prime Day. He loves it as his alarm clock and smart device. This is our 3rd Echo device, and we have them all connected throughout the house. Although you can deactivate the camera, we also chose to cover it since the device is in our bedroom. I'm not comfortable with having a camera in the room (no, we don't bring our cell phones in the room)."
2,"Great product, what they don't tell you is that once you allow a &#34;Drop In&#34;  they can drop in anytime!!!  While they are sleeping, while we are yelling at them, while anything."
2,"I have two. One in my computer room and the other that I move around out on the deck. Not great for watching video, but it can be done. With the added sound you don't get from the Echo Dot, it is perfect for the location I have it in. Add whole house music, and you have just arrived in Nervana."
2,Surprisingly handy. Wish it had more options geared towards it being on your nigh stand. Like an even dimmer setting.
2,"I was on beta list for Alexa, Have a Show, an original Alexa, 4 Echo's and I actually like this the best, even more than show"
2,Love it!
2,"I was contacted by people in India. Were they suppose to charge me $79.00? It was very hard to understand their instructions. They did have control of my computer and network. I, also, bought a Cloud Cam but do not know how to make it work with Alexa."
2,"I have the dot and Echo Plus, this one can't seem to &#34;hear&#34; me as well and doesn't do as much as I expected."
2,Bought this for our son as his birthday present and he loves it.  Often find him jamming to music in his room now  :)  He loves the options for the alarms and we have his weekday alarms set to repeat and he gets to sleep in on non-school days.
2,Great product!
2,I love my echo spot!
2,Excellent purchase!!
2,"What a great little gadget for the house. You ask and it delivers, period. Well done!"
2,My favorite Echo. A more than adequate replacement for a clock radio.
2,"The Echo Spot is compact, nice sound and camera quality. Makes it great to video chat with the family when I'm travelling for work. Ease of use that the youngest member (10 years) has no problem talking to Mama on the video chat and understands the important of digital security."
2,This echo spot is great I love it
2,"The voice recognition is amazing, perfect companion for the bedroom."
2,"I liked it, perfect size, the screen is really clear,  and elegant."
2,"I am not easily impressed with electronic goodies. But...OMG this is by far the coolest thing I have ever had.  It does everything short of clean your house... which, when I asked Alexa to clean my house.... was told she didn’t have hands, but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning!  From reading books to my five year old, to video chat, to silly selfies, music that automatically goes to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, setting timers, alarms, changing my thermostat on voice command, tells me the weather, sends hubby a grocery pick up list, and I am sure. Million more things!BUY IT.....you u will not regret it."
2,"This product is beautifully designed and I no longer have to hide an Echo device away like I did with Dot. It would be nice if Amazon would lose that camera though, which I have not used and might cause squirms for the privacy conscious."
2, 
2,Love this little dot with a screen.  Super easy to set up and easy to use.  Instantly connected to all my other echo products.  I also bought the screen cover that has the blocking button for the camera if you want to use it.  Recommended.
2,Hands free calling in the house. I misplace my cell phone all the time so this is a real blessing. Really enjoying the streaming music.
2,"Got for elderly parents,easy for them to use.just instructions could be more informative"
2,This thing is great. Fantastic alarm clock.
2,"We love using it for bedtime reading on Audible. It's very kid-friendly, and I can see liking it in the kitchen while I'm cooking since it's small and unobtrusive. We like it better than our Echo Dot."
2,very nice gadget. love it's look.
2,Husband loves it!
2,***Love it***
2,Love the Spot - Awesome little guy with precise video - I’m saving to buy one for my mom on the east coast - The Spot changes Everything as far as keeping your loved ones connected!!!Well worth every Cent!!
2,Excellent
2,Awesome item that I had to buy two!
2,It has replaced my clock and Google Mini on my nightstand.  Outstanding little device.  I hope an update will give a simple face and font color options for the clock.
2,I love the echo spot!
2,It every ting I thought it would be plus more.  This will be going to my MOM right after I get through playing with it.
2,The most fascinating thing I've ever bought
2,"Sound quality is less than a dot, microphones don't pick me up as well as the other models (i have Echo and Dots).  Picture quality is good"
2,Awesome cute and smart!
2,"Absolutely love it. After much persuasion from a friend, I finally gave in and bought one. Let's just say that the moment Alexa enters my life, I turn around and tell Siri to get the hell out."
2,I love love love it.
2,GREAT
2,"This is my first Alexa device and it is so fun to discover all of the ways to use it. The biggest con with me is the ""drop-in"" feature, it's pretty creepy"
2,The best thing since sliced bread!
2,"Would be 5 stars if you could turn off the &#34;Things to Try&#34; screen!!!  I should have read up on this before buying the Spot.  Amazon, please update to enable us to turn this off!  It is SO extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see &#34;Things to try&#34;."
2,Love it. So great to use!!!
2,"I never thought I was going to be THAT person that is completely connected. I purchased this and another Echo product on Prime Day and fell in love.  I have one in my office and one in our kitchen.  I have already used this for morning briefings from the News while I am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes.  The screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  I loved this so much I purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.  Note: I did purchase camera covers (even though there is a button to &#34;turn off the camera and microphone&#34; and it doesn't impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about, there are work around!"
2,"LOVE love love this!  I have an echo, and several echo dots, but love the video with this and the clock.  I no longer have to wake up and say &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34; or &#34;Alexa, weather&#34;  I can even watch videos on it if i forget my kindle before bed."
2,After purchasing my Echo Spot to add to our other 4 Amazon Echoes...I am very pleased with the Echo Spot...I use  it with our Arlo Security cameras and Ring video doorbell and works without any problems...
2,"It does so much more than I knew when I bought it. It pretty much runs my house, helps me fall asleep, takes care of my schedule, and entertainment"
2,"Love, love so far. I just received it Thursday. I unwrapped it, set it up, & immediately programmed it. No problem with the reoccurring things to try. I set it to rotate once and shows time like I want. I love the low ambient look at night."
2,"This is the best Alexa enabled device you can get, it is so versatile and useful. It sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo. The screen makes all the difference in the world."
2,"I needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly.  I am a believer in amazon echo, Alexa and fire.  Great customization options and Alexa is always helpful.  Sound quality is also surprisingly good."
2,You're going to have to shell out an extra $20 bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this. My biggest gripe. I already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand.
2,"Love it except that Amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual. I don't have hours to research websites. Plus, more instruction from Alexa on skills would be great. We often get the answer, ""I don't know that skill"" even though I've added it in the app. I.e. Kwikset or Pizza Hut."
2,Such a handy item to have on my night stand. She reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views.
2, 
2,"I got this on Prime day and figured I'd see what all the hype is about.  Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration."
2,"The screen response time is way better than I expected. Sound quality is good too, also it’s not so bright that I have to turn off the screen but it is an option.  I have a Dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds."
2,Love it!
2,"I LOOOOOOOVE this thing! :) Watching movies on it is a bit of a disaster because of the round screen, but other than that it's a GREAT chachki toy :)"
2,We gave the Echo Spot as a gift to my mother in law.  She loves it.  She can play music of all genres!  Easy for her to use.
2,Very easy to set up. Does what is said it will. Very satisfied so far..
2,"Great product, need a bit a adjustment to set up spotify, time, weather, etc.. in Hong Kong, but works fine now. I used it as alarm clock + music in bedroom, love it."
2,"I bought this to replace a Dot in my bedroom. Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I'm very used to these devices. I don't need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I'm not a child and I don't need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn't Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders."
2,This product just looks adorable in any room and I love it. I recently just bought my mom one as a gift on Prime Day and she can't wait to use it.
2,love my spot
2,"Loving this way more than google home devices. I've been using for a couple months and if you're an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google. I'm using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I've paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk. Once there are great offers I could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other Amazon Alexa items for my household. I felt happy after adding this to my house where as I felt stupid using google home."
2,I like it as an Alexa device but its small.
2,What a wonderful little Alexa enabled gadget at like the analog clock face the best
2,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!! Bought it on Prime Day, then had buyers remorse, but once I got it, it was Love at first sight."
2,I like the Echo Spot because it fits into my decor and I can also sing along with my favorite songs
2,Best bedside clock and assistant I have ever had.
2,"Omg where do I start, I LOVE THIS THING! None bad to say!"
2,Works as described.  A+++++
2,"Have not used it yet. But I'm sure it's as great as the others.. I can not get over how amazing the echo , echo dots are. This has to be some of the greatest technology that has ever came out."
2,I am very excited and happy with this. It was a breeze to set up and my favorite feature is reading my Kindle and going to sleep to Thunderstorm music.
2,Still learning to use these things.  They sure are smart!  haha  She started reading a book to me yesterday.  Get one.  I like the way it controls the brightness all by itself when lights are turned off at night.
2,"I highly recommend the spot! I have it connected to the kasa camera and it is so convenient to just ask spot to, &#34;show me the camera&#34; when someone is at the door. Love it! As soon as amazon has a good sale on these again I will be getting another one! Good job Amazon!"
2,Great to wake up to music and being told the weather.
2,"Bought this to replace a Sony Dash (remember those?) after Sony decided to pull support from it entirely. It works great for what I use it for: an alarm clock, a weather station, background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house. My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can't turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It 's an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don't want to see as it cycles through content screens. A software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and don't want to see in the content rotation."
2,Love everything about this product I bought two one for my household and one for my mother in law just so we can video chat with her and for emergency and it’s easy to use for older folks.
2,The echo spot is really great. I just got it and is easy to set up. I do have one problem. When the advertise it they show a screen with the time weather and your town. Sadly there is no way to make this the home screen. The home screen is just the time😔. I spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail. I am disappointed because I wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate. I am hoping they will do something about this. Other than that it’s great
2,"The Echo Spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient! It reminds me of any appointments, warns me about traffic snarls, and tells me the weather every day while suggesting new music and introducing me to new artists."
2, 
2,"Come on - it's amaonmazing!  It's way more than a smart speaker.  It's my wake-up alarm, my security blanket, and infotainment center all-in-one.  It's my connection to the world during night hours when I'm mostly sleepy or zonked-out Zzzzzzz...  I can still access the world without my reading-glasses late at night.  It sounds amazing for its size.  It can hear me when I'm far from awake (mostly).  As they say, &#34;this is a must-have device&#34;.  Yep, that is a true statement."
2,"Got one for me and for my son on Prime Day. We love them! I want one in every room, but that would be excessive."
2,In one word: Amazing! Best tech purchase I have ever made as it controls all devices in my house and even my pool!
2,I’m leaving this for those who don’t have enough of an attention span to read instructions.  You can stop the screen rotations.Swipe down on clock screenSelect settingsHome & clockHome cardsRotate onceProblem solved
2,Very nicely constructed. My wife wanted a second for the kitchen so I order a second one.
2, 
2,"I love this little gadget, replaces my old clock basically, love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates, news briefs.  Let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc.  Yes it's a little pricey, but purchased it on Amazon Prime Now during Prime Day and it was delivered same day for $99."

2,"I love my little Echo Spot, I have replaced my older full size echo with this little guy. The round screen is an interesting choice and I'm not sure I like the look but it is growing on me. The speakers could be slightly louder but all in all it is a solid echo product."
2,"Having received this as a gift, I am writing my initial thoughts: (compared to my google home mini)PROS:  Way easier to setup than the google home mini.  I was able to connect ALL of my smart home device (unlike google) without any issues.  Making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand me.CONS:  Need to enable 'skills' to get more functionality.  Google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than  the amazon echo.  Could not connect this to youtube."
2,Love it
2,Well-made product.Echo Spot - White
2,"Installed on my back porch, works very well!  I did have to get the wall mount for it, which also works well."
2,"Thank God, and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep. I'm a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room. Not this guy. The Alexa features are nice and listening to music at night is great. We enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like. Video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that's to be expected. Audio quality is much better than echo dot."
2,"I love this thing. At first I thought it wouldn’t stay on the clock and that I would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it’s very comfortable for the eyes, easy set up. Love it"
2,"Got it and, as expected, ITS GREAT! Almost a swell as my SHOW."
2,"Love this thing. People think I’m crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock. But I don’t care!! For me, waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it!! So glad I don’t have to deal with my old EEAANH EEAANH EEAANH alarm. Very excited to say “Alexa, turn off the lights” (smart plugs get here soon!) Got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom."
2,"I absolutely love this! Very user friendly and I got the Kasa Cam to go with it to monitor my living room. Super easy to set up and operate. I only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately. I’m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces. I like digital but I miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them. I’d also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices. I really have no complaints, I’m being nit picky at this point. Worth every penny!"
2,Surprisingly good beefy sound out of this thing. I think it might shape up to be one of my favorite echo devices. I have nearly all of them. ;-)
2,"Given as a gift to my wife, to compliment my echo.  She loves it."
2,This is a gift.  But I have one and love it.  The words to songs are great and the I live the face I chose for the clock.  This is my favorite echo (unless I am listening to music).
2,"I’ve had this for a little over 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it! It’s so easy to use. I’m basically using it as a smart alarm but it can do way more. The screen quality is great and it looks super cute sitting on my night stand. I don’t know how I lived without it so long. If you can’t decide whether to buy it or not, GO FOR IT! You won’t regret it!!"
2,"Much easier to use than the dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. I didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I'm not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?  ALEXA???!!"
2,"When we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra $30...so we thought why not? Well, I'm so glad we did! We are really enjoying our Echo Spot. It reads stories to our girls, plays music, gives us the news, and so much more!  It's so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy."
2,"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “Alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having Alexa repeat “OK alarm set for 5am.”  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I’m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I’m in the shower."
2,I bought this for my mother and she loves it! I want to get one for myself now!
2, 
2,"4 out of 5 stars. I have the Original Tall Echo, 4 dots, 2 spots and 1 Show.  The only thing I'm finding a problem with is the speakers in the Spot. when using Drop In.  Sometimes I'm not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  The voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. The optical is fine........ it's just the sound. Sometimes I'll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I'm only 8 feet away plus it's on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.  That's one reason I bought the Echo Show."
2,"I bought this for my 90 year old grandmother and she and I love it!!! She can call all her family members with just her voice, play games, even watch a video and I love that I can “drop in” on her any time to see how she is doing. She lives all by herself. And I feel comfortable if there was an emergency she could call out to Alexa for help!!"
2,"I love this thing! It plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms! If you’re considering purchasing one, get it. It’s worth it."
2,I think it can read my mind
2,Perfect
2,"Love my spot! My favorite feature is the &#34;Alexa, start my day.&#34; I love that I can hear the weather, traffic and even the word of the day! It even goes right into my favorite podcast while I get dressed!"
2,Works. Replaced my expired bedside radio/alarm.It took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screen.Maybe it should said something during the setup process.
2,"Works great I love it, grand daughter digs the watching of cartoons on it lol"
2,Gift for husband.  Great!
2,I had just said to myself how I desired an assistant when I came across the Spot!  As a Mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone’s schedules & my own. I just verbally tell Alexa what reminder or timer I need set and Voila!Having my Spot has given me the virtual assistant I so desired without having to actually hire someone.  Not to mention the many other awesome features. I have Alexa synced with my Audible & Kindle & Alex can read a book from my libraries to me.I’m still excited to see what else my Spot can do!Side note: I had wanted to purchase a Show for a while & probably still will down the line however I sooooo love my sleek little Sopt!
2,"I’m not sure why or how Amazonia asking me about this purchase. I got it as a gift from my kids for Mother’s Day...  It was not bought from my account. Lil bit creepy 😑. I haven’t really had much use for it as no one calls, they text. So that part meh. The other things it does are no different than the other Alexa products."
2,I love love love love it!  I feel like I have a talking computer that tells me EVERYTHING.
2,Love the Echo Show.  Being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful!!
2,"It seems to work well.  Unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because, as many have mentioned, it does not work with google or Youtube any more.  This problem is caused by Google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these.  This even effected my smart TV.  Anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so we'll see what happens when we hand them out."
2,Love listening to music. Still trying to learn everything it does.
2,Very pleasedSimple to figure out
2,"just what I expected,already have 2 other  shows"
2,Very good
2,"Excellent to listen to my music, my audio books, and look all my cameras in and around my house."
2,"Alexa is fun! I’ve added smart home aspects, my friend listens to Spotify, my husband enjoys interacting too."
2,Tremendous way to communicate with friends and family all across the country
2,"It,is,what it is and than some. Sounds great too. On,y thing I dont like the camera being seen by anyone working for amazon  I asked echo show to show me camera and didn’t know what I was saying but knows how to turn camera on and off but can’t dhiw u what’s recording hmm"
2,"Used for personal use. We like hearing weather, news from CNN, and various playlists."
2,Love it!
2,I like the echo show its the best! big screen you can watch movies preview from the movie and alexa will answer all your question you name it.
2,"Prime day pricing was good, but the show is very limited.  No video services available except Amazon Video.  No Netflix or YouTube.  Alexa is very limited also, not nearly as useful as Google."
2,"works great, has great picture easy to setup and use.."
2,The fact that she can help me find my phone when I am at home alone is worth the price of this device
2,"I LOVE THIS ITEM... I UNDERESTIMATED THIS ITEM, I HAVE ANOTHER 2 IN MY CART ... BUT I'M WAITING FOR THE SAME DEAL AGAIN!!!, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM!"
2,"I love using my Echo Show for music, it sounds amazing! Unfortunately the video quality when video chatting isnt great, my husband and I video chat often and his video comes out very clear on my end but he says my image is very pixelated. I'm still learning to use it but so far so good."
2,Love it!
2, 
2,Oh I love my Echo Show and the video news spots
2,This is our second echo show.  We have a home in Mexico and one in the USA.  Now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other.  We can also drop in on the houses when we aren’t there to check on them.  We use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes.  We also have echo dots in various rooms.  We love all this technology!  We ask her many questions and she plays music for us.
2,Needs to play YouTube and prime video and maybe Netflix. But it has good sound
2,We love our Echo Show!
2,Great product
2,"I love this device. I upgraded from the Echo Spot. I just wish I could customize the clock on my screen to analog, to mimic what I was used to in the echo spot. Also, there is better sound quality on this device."
2,"Love this thing.. Best toy I've bought myself in awhile.. So far I have a smart plug connected running my Ac.  And the wifi light bulbs.  Baseball scores, weather are  cool but the music is the best feature."
2,"This thing is a lot cooler than I thought it would be.  I mostly have used it to read me audiobooks, but I also love that I can see into the camera while I'm at work."
2,"I’m really enjoying this product. Love the flash briefing, the timers, the weather reports and more."
2,We love the Show.  It loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an Show issue or our internet issue.  But overall we use it for many applications.
2,Works well with optional cameras.  Conferencing is good.  Still feel like Bezos is spying on me.
2,I can connect my smart lights and my phone. And any other smart device. It's just so convenient that I highly reccomend it to anyone who have the disposable income.
2,"Love, love, LOVE!!!"
2,Love all my Echo products. I like the video phone feature on this. Can check in on our cat when on vacation.
2,"Works exactly how you would expect, right out of the box. I love being able to not only hear, but now see, what I need on this device. I loved my regular echo, but the Show is just so much better!  It works wonderfully for music (especially paired with the Amazon music account) and is perfect with my ring doorbell. Love it!"
2,I absolutely LOVE this!!!  I have it in my kitchen so I can use it for cooking. The speakers are amazing!!!
2,I've only had this a week but so far so good.  We are enjoying it.
2,"Love the product idea. Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it's supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product."
2,Very excited to see what it can do
2,"This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating ""things to try"" on the home screen. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but hopefully soon Amazon allows the option to shut it off."
2,"I love the idea is the star trek computer at home. The skills are great, but the natural language work is mediocre."
2,"Got this as a gift... so cool!  I can view my news, recipes or shopping lists.  And much more!!!"
2,"I do love it. Was easy to set up so far, but I wish it has a little more in the set up instructions. There is still a whole lot more I would like to be able to do with it and I have no idea if I can or not with it. But I really do like it."
2,This is my second one. I have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.It is amazing for a quick look up while I am working. I live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.I will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. The gift of organization and information at a voice command away.
2,I love it. It does everything.
2,"I purchased echo about 2 weeks ago , I love this product, I would definitely recommend"
2,"I'm loving my new Echo Show. The video screen adds so much more value and potential. Movies, tv shows, song lyrics, all extra features that are available with the Echo Show. Oh, it also has a built in camera for taking pics."
2,"My wife has been using Skype for years to talk to her parents daily, with constant technical issues.  Since her father is 88, it's a lot to ask the man to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure Skype, but he does.  When I saw these on sale, I jumped on them.  My wife was resistant to &#34;learn a new technology&#34;, but I told her these just work - like the video phones I saw at the New York World's Fair in 1964 - 54 years ago!Yesterday it set up quickly and worked fine, with no issues.  My wife told her co-worker today and she went out and bought 3 - one for herself and her husband, and one for each set of parents.  It just works, like a telephone - imagine that."
2,Bluetooth sound is great. Videos are crazy. It’s an amazing device.
2,"Great item for knowledge, directions, music,laughter and more"
2,very nice-needs some work
2,Very cool!
2,Enjoy using it.  Great sound.  Love the shopping list
2,"The Echo Show is ok, however the constant suggestions about what to ask Alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it. Also, I thought I could have the weather for an area displayed continuously,  but I have to talk to Alexa, which I don't want to do in the middle of the night. Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them."
2,We held off purchasing an Echo but couldn't resist during Prime Days.  The Echo works great and it's nice to have the screen.  There is still a lot more we need to learn how to do.
2, 
2,"Love it very much, still learning everything that my Echo can do, but am really enjoying the whole process."
2,Love it!! Still learning all the possibilities.
2,I love the echo show awesome speakers I love the fact when you listen to music the words come up all around liking it so far. Also being able to read what's on your shopping list to do list and notifications
2,Nice works great
2,Easy to set up and sooooooo many things it can do.  Just awesome!
2,Met every expectation I had
2,I like it
2,"Unit is working great, but it is a true PIA that products today are shipped without user manuals. Do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? I have no idea of the echo show's capabilities. I have it linked to my Hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won't. I purchased a Fire TV Stick along with the Show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. Just a few examples.I even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. Seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants."
2,It's a fun item to have.  Has a lot of udefulness.  Big negative is that it doesn't use Google (or any real search engine) to get answers or find information.
2,I was pleasantly surprised! It’s awesome so far
2,"Alexa Show is amazing. My wife hated that I bought it, thought we didn't need it and after a day she fell in love with Alexa too lol. It is so convenient for setting timers, listening to music, playing music for the dog while im not home, connecting to bluetooth speakers for parties, playing movies. I love it!"
2,"It makes talking with your grandchildren so easy, especially for the little ones.  Outstanding product!"
2,Great product.
2,I already had purchased the Echo and a couple of Dots and hesitated to purchase this until the price dropped.  I am very glad I did.  The versatility of the video screen is outstanding.  No regrets!
2,"I purchased the ""Show "" to keep in touch with my daughter and her family after their recent move half way across the country.  It is wonderful seeing their faces during our conversations."
2,"My difficulty is I dont have a cell phone,and now you cant download the alexa app on a Mac book air.  SO I am stuck, unable to program my echo show properly. In my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done. and the echo show does it. every time i ask for something I am referred back to the alexa app.on your mobile device, which I cannot access.To me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to function.Every thing today is pushed to the phone,  because the phone has been made accessable,  to all those who wish  to gather information"
2,Great in the kitchen.  I love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes.  Also great for listening to music and watching shows on Amazon Prime Video while I cook.  I subsequently bought an Echo Dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom.  I created a group so I can play music on both of them at the same time.  I plan to add more speakers in the future.
2,"Excellent quality, very good sound, great deal on Prime Day."
2,So far so good.  Neat to have a visual version of alexa's responses. Nice to see the lyrics of music you are listening to.  Flash briefings have good videos.  Speaker is much better than a dot but not the highest quality
2,It’s fun
2,fun so far. learning to use her.
2,works great.. nice sound and picture
2,"This product is even better than I imagined. I love the timer setting, it reminds me to put the clothes in the dryer if i ask it to, and i love shopping list feature.  My family enjoys the games too! It’s made my life a little more easy! Alexa is my personal assistant. :)"
2,I love it.
2,Highly like my eco show.no complaints
2,"love it! so glad we got it on Prime Day, although now having it, I would totally pay full price for it!"
2,"Great addition to the Alexa family.  Nice having the &#34;visual&#34; part of pics, recipes, etc."
2,We love it!!  We use it every day and are finding new ways to use it the longer we have it!
2,Easy set up
2,"Pleased with the Echo, it is loud and can hear my voice and understand much better than previous versions."
2,"Love it!  Great to request music and be able to see lyrics.  I had a dot, but this is so much better."
2,What we liked most was actually seeing the words to song. Least would be I guess I expected a little more from her than is currently available.
2,"I’m just learning about this product, but what I know I love !"
2,Easy to use!
2,it does what it needs to.
2,"I love this product.  I'm not very computer literate but everything is voice controlled.  I use this to keep in touch with my daughter, she lives out of town.  Now we just drop in on each other. It's like we are living net door to each other."
2,I enjoy seeing lyrics on the screen for different Amazon music stations
2,love the Echo show great in  kitchen  for recipes
2,Only problem is my slow internet. I really like the speaker on it. Having tons of fun with it
2,"Love my Echo Show. Alexa is amazing and now on the Show &#34;she&#34; can display lyrics, photos, etc. The speakers are amazing and fills the room. Bought on Prime Day so got a great deal, so worth it."
2,LOVE MY ECHO SHOW.  Everything about this device is wonderful
2,"Used to have fun with. Great to play music, turn on lights and who know what else."
2,"Works great , seems to be a delay bringing up ring cameras but sound and video quality are good"
2,Works on great i  use it with my Arlo security system
2,"this is so fun! I really enjoy using it. I have it hooked up to one of my lights so I just tell Alexa when I want that on and off. also, it connects to my Spotify so I just have Alexa resume my playlist and we pick off right where we ended. I feel like there's even more I can do with this, so I'm excited to use it more!"
2,"Upgraded from an original Echo on Prime Day and so far I love it. I'm sure I have a long way to go to maximize its utility,  but for now I owe my marked increase in lyrical knowledge to this thing. Who knew Post Malone actually used words?!"
2,You can't access YouTube! Why do consumer's have to pay for this argument! Why can't we just have a good product that offers what we need?
2, 
2,Still learning about the Echo show but so far we love it. My 9 year old loves to cook and especially with his Aunt that lives out of state and now he can connect with her and they cook together.
2,"I love having this on my desk. The fact that I can video with friends, listen to music with the words right there, and see my Amazon Cloud Cam feeds from one location is pretty spectacular. I got this one sale too, which was stellar. It has me thinking I need another one for the front room."
2,Love it!
2,Love my echo show! Great sound and picture. Does a great job thing in my entire echo collection!
2,Can’t change voice of Echo
2,Does everything I could ask and more. Great product.
2,I like how clear the screen is. Hi resolution
2,It is so easy to use and is everything I hoped for
2,"I love the Echo Show. I’m going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect. Some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense. We carry devices with cameras all the time. The only difference here is that the item is stationary. My family and I also find the drop-in feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy. It’s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.I’d also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device. The Show would be a lot less blind friendly, even with Alexa present, if they hadn’t included that.We are an echo-loving household with two dots, three echos, and now two Shows. I wouldn’t be surprised if we got more in the future for ourselves or loved ones. Thanks, Amazon!"
2,I love it it is awesome
2,Very Good to be able to listen to Every single song at any time in Amazon's vast library. We're only just beginning to know everything Echo Show has to offer. Well worth the price!! Alexa is very helpful.
2,Love it!
2,"Great sound and the screen is nice to actually see time, trivia, etc."
2,This has been perfect for being able to see my canary cameras and that’s exactly what I wanted! I have been happy with all my Alexa’s because we have several and this is a great addition.
2,I really love this item!  So much fun!
2,I agree ...YouTube should be on there.
2,"We like it a lot, sound is better than the original echo, the bass feels deeper.  The screen is cool, though, havent got a lot of use out of it though."
2,Good sound! The capacity of join different apps to make work your smart home
2,"Great addition to the Alexa family, just wish it could use the screen more than backgrounds. Don't get me wrong I don't regret buying it especially for the primeday sale of $100 off sale price but for now the skills for the show are lacking."
2,I've had previous experience with the echo Dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the water!It's great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud.
2,"Love the echo show, can keep I can video chat with the kids and grandkids. I have it in the kitchen, so when I run out of something I have Alexa to add it to my grocery list. I use it for everything. Was very easy to set up"
2,I’m really hoping for skills that take advantage of the shows touch screen. There’s an incredible amount of untapped potential locked behind the restrictions. Make use of the best part of having the show and enable skills to navigate by touch please!
2,Love it l. I plan on getting an echo for the kitchen.
2,It does not pick up my voice unless I yell most times.
2,great love it
2,Amazing!
2,"Seems to be a good product but, unable to play music in sync with my Sonos system. Sonos doesn't seem to recognize it at all."
2,Great product.  Like the apps that I can connect to it.
2,I love it now able to talk to my grandson with ease and the picture quality is great
2,"Love it! Easy setup and I can ‘Drop in’ on my daughter and son-in-law who live in St. Louis anytime. Everyone loves to have their mother drop in, right 😎"
2,Fun
2,I use this to control my smart home.
2,"Show has been great. Still learning what it can do, but being able to watch videos, talk face to face with others are not features."
2,Wish I bought one for work too
2,Love the echo show
2,Works well. Not thrilled that most of the apps have to be paid for seprately.
2,Video calls to Mom
2,"Love being able to see, as well as hear things.  Sound is better, too!"
2,I love it
2,Just like any other echo. Doesn’t disappoint
2,"Nice picture good sound but the mics are not as sensitive as a dot, my dots can hear me from across the house the Show does not, that being said I LOVE the show!!I can watch TV and movies while in tg ed kitchen, have the News playing or Music....love....it !!"
2,"I basically use it to play music  and tell me the news..its sometimes hard to communicate with it, if i dont say the command correctly, but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i dont say them exactly as i should."
2,Upgraded from echo to echo show.
2,"I love the Echo Show!! I have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the Show is so much better.  The sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4K tv.  I love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  I purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.  When the dot was given to me, I thought ""this is a cute novelty,  but I'll probably never use it"". Was I wrong!!  Echo is part of my daily routine,  and has made my life so much easier."
2,"So far I’m very pleased with my Echo Show.  The problem is, there’s so much it can do that I haven’t been able to explore the extent of its abilities! I got the special price as part of the Prime Day promotion...and you just can’t beat what you get for the price.  Very pleased with the sound. The video screen is sharp. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I’m hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  If I’m going to pay for Prime Music...I’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with my Echo Show.  So pleased in fact, that I bought a second one!"
2,"I like everything, about this ! Im still learning how to use it!"
2,Really easy to use
2,It's great sound and video quality
2,"It does everything the Echo does, and more. Although I haven't and probably won't use the video functions. I had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization. It does not and is very limited. I would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time, it only displays in very small text. It also always has a line that says &#34;Tell Alexa to do this, or that&#34;, tips at the bottom of the screen. I would like to see that go away, but it won't. Sound quality is good, not as good as the big Echo, but good enough. I bought it on sale and think I got value for what I paid. I would have been disappointment had I of paid full price."
2,Love my echo show!
2,I enjoy this thing. Its learning
2,Am very happy now that i can see.
2,"So far, I like it.  It is better than I expecting it."
2,Doesn't always respond to the wake word. This is my 3rd echo product and I have to say I am A little disappointed. Alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to  getting answers for search queries.
2,Good product.
2,"After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to."
2, 
2,Love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs.
2,"This thing is awesome for grocery lists, paired with the AnyList app. The flash briefing is very good too. My only complaint is that once you pause something, Alexa decides that you no longer want to listen to that thing. Forever. All in all, definitely worth the purchase."
2,"Works great, video call function nice when communicating through drop-in"
2, 
2,As you can see Echo Show is in kitchen. It far exceeds my expectation. There’s a wealth of information about any topic. If is customizable for sound and video. I also have Echo and Echo Dot. You can group them and have hole house music. Still not done exploring all it can do love it. Perfect for getting recipes so you can see them while you’re preparing to cook.
2,Fairly easy to use
2,Absolutely LOVE my Echo Show!  It is awesome and works great with my Ring Video Spotlight Cams!  Music on demand and so many more features that I have yet to explore!!!
2,Absolutely love it! I use it for everything!I tell my friends and clients that it’s the daughter I never had. I ask her to do something and she doesn’t complain! I wish I bought the 2package deal :( I truly needed one in my work room. I kick myself for it.
2,"We love having this in our kitchen! Very convenient to look up recipes, listen to the news, or watch prime video while I'm cooking"
2,The greatest
2,Love it
2,This is my fourth Echo (original and two dots). It's the best.... Decent speaker... Fun graphics...
2,I loved talking it out of the box and being able to easily set up.
2,Easy to setup and use. The ability to play video is huge addition on Alexa device family
2,"All the music I can listen too, Also the movie I can watch I can see my ring doorbell ."
2,No enough video options
2,Great sound
2,I took advantage of prime Friday and decided to take a chance and purchase one.  I enjoy the features it comes with. I'm sorry I didn't purchase two of them  Well worth the money.  Its looks great on my nightstand.  Every night it puts me to steep with sleeping music.  Happy customer!
2,The music...the shopping list and the sound....
2,"diversity, so many things to see and hear. Wealth of information"
2,Love it. Thanks Amazon. You guys rock!!
2,Love it!
2,I like the design and the visuals!
2,"I haven't had my show very long or used it a lot, but I love it! I use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time. I also use it to check for different recipes, listen to music and my all time favorite.... telling everyone it is time for dinner. My son gets a real kick out of that!I know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment, but remember the original echo didn't have what it has now when it first came out. I see that Amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon I am sure it will have all that we want very soon.... maybe even things we haven't thought of!I do wish it was a bit more user friendly. I still haven't figured out how to video chat with my cousin in North Carolina who also has one, and when I tried to call my son's dot it went to video chat immediately, last I looked, dots don't have video screens!Another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep, it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill I had enabled that was free. So now he is a bit worried to use it again. That needs to be fixed.I do have to say that all in all I am very happy with my Echo Show!"
2,I have not had it very long. It's my first Alexa thing. I sure like what I have done with it so far there is a lot to learn and play with
2,Works great and has been fun to use.
2,This is the best of my echo devices and I own a spot a dot and echo
2,Having the large screen really majes this an enjoyable experience. Only thing it’s missing is youtube.
2,easy to use.
2,"I bought it to go with my security camera system, but it did not perform like I thought it would. It doesn't alert us when someone is at the door. Also, I can't talk to the person at the door through the echo show, only through my cell phone."
2,Super fun !! I ty is what I was expecting
2, 
2,I love this so much!! Alexa is even better when she can show you things!
2,I have the echo but got 2 show. 1 for my Daughter. Absolutely love it. Especially for the video chat.
2,"I've had an Alexa Dot for some time but I'm really enjoying the Alexa Show. It's great to have a visual whether it's a song or the weather. Played Jeapordy, but I'm not good at it. You do learn trivia and no one's watching! Love that recipes are visible and movies are available. Haven't had it long enough to try everything."
2,Got this on Amazon prime with the ring pro. Work really great. Being the lazy guy I am I don't need to go see who at my door anymore while I'm gaming.
2,"We originally got the Show to video chat family members, and it works great for that. We have found that we really like checking things hands-free like the weather and recipes. So far we have really liked the Show, and would recommend it!"
2,Easy setup. Was up and running in minutes. The learning feature is outstanding. Now I know why Amazon is so far ahead of the competition.
2,"quite nice...clear, great sound."
2,"Versatile use, can watch movies or news.  Able to use as remote for vehicle.  Or use as a communication hub for the home.  Great produc!!!"
2,I bought two.  One for me and one for my daughter who lives in another state.  We love it!!
2,The best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti-technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well. Well done.
2,"It’s my second one, so I put this one in the kitchen for recipes."
2,Echo Show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there. No need to print them. Wonderful device. Acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room.
2,"Great fun but frustrating at times. Commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) Also would like more video options with flash briefings. Still really a tech wonder for a low price."
2,Love that you can play music and see the lyrics.  Connected to my echo dot I enjoy listening in multiple rooms.
2,"I love Alexa and when I had the chance to add Show to my home... I jumped at it.  But... I'm a member and my Show doesn't know I paid for the extras with my Echo (now in the upstairs bedroom.  If I am supposed to pay more for having Show added to my home, then I'm afraid to ask &#34;What's the point?&#34;"
2,Purchased as a more &#34;personal&#34; contact vehicle for engaging with long distance grandchildren. Works perfectly in every regard. Resolution and sound both better than expected. Highly recommend.
2,"Works well, pictures awesome! Sound could be better. Must be on the same bandwidth as other Alexa devices for whole home music. 2.4ghz vs 5ghz."
2,"I am pleased with the Echo Show, from the sound of the music and the words to the tunes to the news and weather. The color on the screen for my photos could be better."
2,Echo Show is my personal assistant! Awesome!!!
2,"The packaging was beautiful and then there she was!! We have 2 dots and an echo plus already. Now we have the show and we love it. An echo for each room!You can also say &#34;Alexa, turn off the screen&#34; and it will go black. This is good for sleeping."
2,"The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates."
2,"My daughter has an Echo Show and she told me how much she loved it. I bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it!  It has all the features of the others plus great extras. The sound system is awesome. I also own the original Echo Tower, Dots and Spot. Each are great and have their uses around my house. I highly recommend all of these products."
