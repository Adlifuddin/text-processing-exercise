i love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite i am just under  feet tall and usually wear a  in this brand this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame not a stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me i returned this dress
this is a nice choice for holiday gatherings i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings the size small fit me well  i am usually a size  with a small bust in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up but then perhaps the waist will be too big the problem with this dress is the quality the fabrics are terrible the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip
material and color is nice  the leg opening is very large  i am   and the length hits me right above my ankle  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle and front pleats to make me fluffy i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look  if you are at least average height or taller this may look good on you
i love the look and feel of this tulle dress i was looking for something different but not over the top for new years eve im small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look once i steamed the tulle it was perfect i ordered an xsp length was perfect too
im upset because for the price of the dress i thought it was embroidered no that is a print on the fabric i think i cried a little when i opened the box it is still ver pretty i would say it is true to size it is a tad bit big on me but i am very tiny but i can still get away with it the color is vibrant the style is unique skirt portion is pretty poofy i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price although the quality is definitely there except i wish it were emb
cute little dress fits tts it is a little high waisted good length for my  height i like the dress im just not in love with it i dont think it looks or feels cheap it appears just as pictured
i love this shirt because when i first saw it i wasnt sure if it was a shirt or dress since it is seethrough if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings i bought a slip wore the tie in the back and rocked it with white wedges you could also wear it as a vest be careful with the buttons i havent had any fall off yet but i feel like they will overall its great for any occasion and its fun to wear
this sweater is so comfy and classic  it balances a quirky handknit look with a beautiful color and practical fit it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style and as others mentioned there are gaps in the knit that make it seethrough in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering i like having a longer camisole showing underneath or wearing it over a little dress its warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat
i ordered this  months ago and it finally came off back order a huge disappointment the fit  so much the issue for me the quality of the wool is subpar someone else mentioned a quotfelted woolquoti guess is that what you call it  it does literally feel like felt super thin itchy  drape very well and feels cheap made in china i got it on sale but still not worth what i paid definitely going back
first this is thermal so naturally i didnt expect super sheer but it is really sheer light fabric i like it but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it second it is large i ordered the size  and its a nice oversized fit for my   pounds i wouldnt want to go larger along with being sheer the fabric is easily stretched which i dont mind in this case finally the color it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot
i love this top i wear it all the time  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade  id still recommend it as it is so comfortable
nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman im picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didnt look great on me theres a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely its a lightweight tee fabric thats opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend
i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra its soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it its comfortable so thats a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though
i got this in the petite length size o and it fit just right i like that i didnt have to have it altered in the length can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with a belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline its a tricky one to pull off i have a wide belt that sort of does th
just received this in the mail tried it on and am smitten im usually a l but sometimes im a xl if no stretch in retailer tops i bought this one in l and im sure glad i did very flowy stretchy and comfortable i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a tshirt and the other is more of a blouse i almost think i couldve gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me
i am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store i am petite and only  so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on but i think it is still super cute and flattering i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type i am petite and weigh about  lbs
i usually size up with this brand small was perfect for me at  this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms
this dress is adorable  its a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining though still overpriced in my opinion the tie detail is somewhat adjustable and i found my normal size s to fit fine   where this gets me is the fact that its dry cleantotally doesnt make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer i might bring it back for that alone since i originally planned to wear it a lot 
"i tried this on from the sale section and they only had a  i usually do  and surprisingly that size was the right fit it is fitted with just enough room to eat  te blue is a light blue almost neutral with the white embroidery i think it looked stylish and decided to keep it the peplum part hit just in the right spot i am short petite but my torso is normal size"
i debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model but if i was to tighten it it looks a lot more flattering i tried on the xs in the store i usually do that to decide if i need petite and it looked huge when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work it was a lot of fabric and looser didnt look as good on me but i like the dress overall so still recommend and for those who like the looser look this is great i would however order eptite for   lbs  dd che

this top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model the pattern and texture are both lovely and the peplum is surprisingly flattering it is definitely on the short side but i think that gives it a modern look the fabric does not stretch at all but i still think it fits tts if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size but otherwise i would order your normal size

i find that this brand can be a little bit allovertheplace with sizes had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well i bought a m in another shirt from them the seamed scoop neck and that shirt was a full  inches smaller in the bust than this just something to keep in mind still a great shirt love the neutral color
i read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated however they are sadly very true let me be clear that this is a beautiful comfortable piece of clothing when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality and while the pattern is interesting and pretty the dark orange color i was expecting is actually a mud brown i think its unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket but i digress the
this top is super comfy and casual the slitdesign in the front gives it more of a stylish look than your average white long sleeve tee would definitely recommend
intrepid soul that i am i washed it in the machine in cold water on a  minute cycle then put it in the dryer for  minutes shook it out hung it up and it is just the same as when it went in doesnt need to be ironed and didnt shrink yes the swing is vast but that is part of its charm pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything i think it is fun something i will use for years wonderfully comfort

in my retailer this was hung over in the pj section and it really has more of a jammie top feel soft thin and stretchy its super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice mine seems to have stretched out a little especially the neckline and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed im happy with it though for what it is  a great casual day t
i love this vest there are so many ways to style itopen or tied closed over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans i get compliments every time i wear it its soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavyhot to wear all day
perfect for work or going out i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate it did not feel scratchy to me maybe because i layered it great buy especially with the discounts feel like i lucked out

"my firned tried this on and her first comment was take it off it is scratchy so i didnt bother trying it on it is however beautiful if you are not sensitive to scratchy materialfit was true to size"
this is a lovely pencil skirt that is wellmade and really brightens a work day like a lot skirts with multiple colors a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact
this is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner it wasnt as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews however it ran a little big im  and about  pounds and i almost always wear a size  but the six was too big id recommend sizing down it was also lower cut than i thought it would beshowed a lot of cleavage im a  so its not work appropriate 
the online picture does not do this skirt justice its very pretty and unique in design i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture this is truly a pretty pencil skirt
"but i thought this was lace or with texture it is more a pattern on regular fabriccolors are nice there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern the fit is nice the  fit snugly enough i dont think there was much give but that was comfortable enough petite length did end below the knee as shown i think it would have been nicer shorter but dont want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behindmaybe on sale "

"i bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it so many people compliment it i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up obviously with a statement necklace too but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink which i hope it doesnt because it is one of my favorite pieces unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the"
unlike the other reviewers i did not have any problem with the sizing fit or length of this skirt it is a midi skirt so i think its suppose to be a little bit longer for me it fit true to size for reference i am   pounds and the size  fit perfectly i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good

for a now feel that comfy and well made this was a great choice
i love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist i am normally a  in retailer skirts and the size  was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable the quality is ok something i feel i would see at another type of discount store for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus

gorgeous top very nice detail work soft and flattering i dont think its too full on the bottom at all  mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette word of warning soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink  and definitely not my color if peach isnt flattering on you heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade bummer that i thought the other reviewers might
im   lbs  d i bought the medium i think i could have gotten the small but i didnt have time to reorder it fit fine but could have been a little more snug around my top half i love the length and the fabric
adorable too chilly now to wear alone  too cute to cover it up my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w it though size  fits me perfectly  looks pretty much on me as in the pic love plaid  cotton blend tops anyways ruffles  adorable  im not too big on that but do love this look when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd smokylike odor but its the dye i think after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared i have in mind to wear w the pilcr

this dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess  falls in the right area and absolutely adorable  the dress is very fragile handle with care
this is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer or warmer climates  very fresh and airy the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight it is not too thin or see through ii does not get overly wrinkled either the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down the v neck is just right not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage but deep enough to be feminine and slimming i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses
fun detail with the beading and lace arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected but thats the style of the piece the fit was tts with those proportions mind  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up it might be a little longer in the body but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change the material isnt too thick so its a nice lighter layer for fallspring really love it
i went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews but i should have ordered my own size as theyre a bit loose around the waist the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering so i definitely recommend them
love pilcro love the stripes and the length  but this particular pair of capriscrops are super tight fitting i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight i guess its just the cutfabric combo i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel  may work for you however
i tried these on in the store and they are super cute but run small i typically wear a size  im   and  lbs and they were too tight for me i like the fabric and the cut i think theyd be great one size up my store didnt have them
i love these pants i have worn them a number of times already this season i am  so i did have to have them hemmed i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still  or  on the pants so i dont think they look odd i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks
i have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite great comfy casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up highly recommend for summer
i purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly it fits me very well im    waist  hips the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model i like the vneck the most because the ruffles are not too much and its not too low cut i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and its brighter for springsummer i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish by the way the fabric is super soft but not w

i really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesnt seem to be a womans white t on the planet that isnt these days however it was really sheer the fit was also short and boxy this coming from a  woman who is shortwaisted on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute maybe if you are younger and dont mind the sheerness its worth the gambl
i liked the color of this top but i didnt really like the ruffled stitching around the middle it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half i bought this for my daughter and she likes it i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in
comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details soft and not baggy a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier im   pounds with an athletic hourglass shape  i bought the  which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt im normally an retailer small but i dont think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted great comfy weekend piece

"love this topit is a full swing top but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectlyi have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of complimentslove both colors and having fun wearing themand after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the picruns true to size and in the arms slightly tight so i went with my usual med and fits perfectif you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size otherwise very true to size"
love love love this dress it is very slimming it hugs you without really touching you leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel
after missing out on last years similar dress i am so glad i finally purchased this one it is beautiful in person i bought to wear to a wedding but i am curious if others think it might be too white i bought the peach color i will keep this dress no matter what hope they come out with more next season
ive been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff id prefer a softer kind of fabric i wonder if it would soften if it was washed also it ran surprisingly small i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didnt leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms the medium worked better i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing i think ill wait and see if this one goes on sal

i love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring  summer the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tuckedin the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color
im   lbs ordered small fits perfect super soft denim love the color love the worn in feel
this dress is stunning vibrant colors and flirty feel to it i got the small and i am a  pants  lbs great fit i only question two things am i tall enough to pull off the extra fabric in the back and what the heck do you where for a bra those two considerations are why i didnt give it  stars
i love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants
love this top made with  cotton a vintage look and flattering details this top is a winner for me i think it fits true to size got my regular size  and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short  it is somewhat see through but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work i think it can be worn without a cami the perfect lightweight comfortable standout piece for the summer time

i really like this blouse a lot very very easy to wear i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend very flattering and great blue color very happy with this purchase highly recommend i am  short torso and my usual  worked
this is an awesome vest  so soft cozy and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did ill mention the one flawno pockets  still totally worth full price in my mind though
i find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small im usually an  but needed this in a  this shirt is reallly just perfect great sleeve length just the right amount of v neck beautiful pattern with a vintage feel i love the combo of stripes polka dots and sweet flowers
the photo of these is truly misleading  they are a beautiful vibrant print  see the closeup photo they are much longer on a regular person  they come a few inches above my ankle and i am  is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each like a pleat that really allows a nice flow these look great with boots flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large not lined but drape beautifully there are pockets sewn closed upon purchase and pack pockets
like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short im only  xs and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model also the quality isnt great as its very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front its a shame bc the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique sadly its going back
i didnt think anything of this top online i really dont care for how they styled it but in store it was more interesting im currently anywhere between a   xssm depending on the style    size  regular in this top fit me perfectly for some reason on me the sleeves were elongating and flattering closer to my elbow and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but due to the color and p
im a pretty solid  in this brand i went with the  since some thought the top to run smalland i agree while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear its tight in the shoulders and chest for the record those are  areas i never have problems with im a  and it was flattening my chest it was also quite short on me i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button the shirt felt more like a size  than 
i gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester polyrayon blend in it and i dont like polyester still i couldnt pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat its like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing its a little on the pricey side since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat i would have liked the price better if it was  less it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on i
i got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it i am either an xs or s in antho and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy normally i would have overlooked this shirt as its rather unimpressive on the hanger but it was on sale so i tried it on very cute when tried on it fits well across the shoulders but isnt too clingy in the body which i like the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor
not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews i am tall and have a long torso so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering maybe if your taller it hangs better i have to say i love everything about it it is a fantastic print it is very flowy but i dont think its too much in that regard i think it is fitting with the romantic girly style of the garment in my opinion not too short just right i took a medium i am  and athletic

i wouldve looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy im usually a m but went with the s bc it looked better fitted this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy i cant wait to wear would look great with white jeans
ive been looking for the perfect workappropriate lace dress for a casualcreative work environment for a while and this was just the ticket the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace i rolled the sleeves to a shortsleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more although the sleeves worn long are absolutely gorgeous the lace isnt exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used but pretty nonetheless im   and th
i ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large  so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly love the length it hits mid hip it is more of an aline than straight as show in the picture the detail is fun and the sweater is well made highly recommend it i have received lots of compliments on this sweater
i love this top its design is very pretty and like nothing that i have i think this top runs true to size im usually an xss in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily so while wearing it you have to be very careful
i dont normally review my purchases but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made i couldnt help myself but to post a review the neck line isnt even hemmed down so it flaps up the material is thin and feel cheap this dress isnt even worth  in my opinion i was expecting a well made good quality dress for the high price tag

"im surprised other reviewers loved this one so much its completely different then how it looks on the model its much shorter which others do mention but it flares a lot enough to feel maternityish on me it looks fitted on the model maybe its my shape i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips i ordered an xs too i will say the materialis very nice and its well made but its going back"
great fit no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size very cute for reference    lbs and take a  they look just like they do on the model i highly recommend
just tried layered sadie top and it felt so nice on good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed this item is definitely vanitysized im   and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternityesque highly recommend because its gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you

i got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress it was not well made at all the lining didnt line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need the fabric itself is very nice but just not well made i do not recommend this dress
soft comfortable stylish i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time very versatile
"i thought this dress was worth reviewing since my opinion differs from many othersi agree that the fabric is quite thin compared to what you may be used to with byron lars dresses but the flattering fit and quality has a nice built in slip i found to be what you may expect from the brand if you go in thinking its more of a springsummer dress you will not be disappointedhowever i find the sizing to be slightly off i usually wear a  im  or a  regulari ordered several size"
i really love this laceup shirt but i only liked it in black on me i like it open like the model is wearing it but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a waysand i felt like i was revealing a little too much i would likely wear it open but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable i absolutely love the whole outfit aspictured and also reviewed the polka dot pants i wish the laces were a little longer than they areif you have i
i love byron lars dresses and this design is onpoint the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty and the dress fits like a dream however  the fabric i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel this is sadly going back today
"i purchased this jacket in green xsmall a while back and wasnt  sure about it due to the size im   lbs and a  and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it recently i purchased the black xsmall and this i love its looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops i do recommend both jackets they are pricey for what"
i just tried this top in red in xs and i think its cute its fairly fitted in my opinion the sleeves are pretty snug but theres stretch to them i was fine with the fabric and the size xs im  lbs  even though sometimes i fit better in xspetite the only downside is that the washing instructions say to remove the tie before machine washing and i guess that put me off a little the idea of relacing it every time so i havent yet bought it the red is vibrant tomato red and the

"i love this shirt so much that ive now bought it in  colors  the olive green and the red probably would have bought it in black too if i didnt already have enough black shirts its both a plain and simple tee but with the fun laceup detail at the neckline that keeps it from being boringit runs true to size but is very fitted however due to the thickness of the material i didnt feel like any unflattering bumps or lumps were being highlighted despite how close the shirt fit to my"
i got this top in navy and i love it its loose and flowy and comfortable yet dressy enough to wear for work or dress down with jeans im   and the  was a bit large on me i couldve sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to definitely recommend
i purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price i believe the navy is on sale my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large i might have been better off sizing down but i bought it online so i just decided to live with it pretty top though i do think it runs large
i purchased this blouse because i love a  vibe in my tops it is a beautiful colorful top but the colors werent flattering on me having said that the cut is nice the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely and the fit was fine on me i am a curvy  with a  c cup go for it if this is a style you like one other note i wish it had been a bit longer but i am older and prefer a little more coverage its just a personal preference i think the picture is an accurate depiction
its hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size im a  and it makes it this much harder i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price when it arrived i was so excited retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items it was wrapped beautiful and no damage i ordered a size  knowing that my chest could be a potential problem the too itself is gorgeous i did

ordered this in white it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving perhaps it is my large stomach but it hugs a bit too much for my liking yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum
i got to try this on today and i really like it the fabric is a normal tshirt kind of fabric i was hoping it would have been kind of special and the vneck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing i would feel comfortable wearing it asis outside of work but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work normally i am not a huge fan of vneck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks camis these days are often made with a versatile v and
i ordered this top in the solid navy the quality seemed very good and my overall impression was favorable what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving so many of the ontrend cold shoulder tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement unfortunately this top ran quite a bit large if you are in between sizes  i definitely recommend sizing down ive not seen the printed floral option but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo
i ordered this dress in size xl in the greyredyellow combination i love everything about this dress its comfortable the colors are cheerful the proportions of where the stripes are placed works but i have to return this dress its too short for what im comfortable wearing i saw from the photos that this comes midthigh on the taller models i hoped that would mean it would be more kneelength for me unfortunately its just too short and id feel selfconscious i dont want to deal
this blouse is so pretty and well made it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day loose in a flattering way it does not look like a maternity top very happy
i love the layered look of this jacket i got it in navy which matches everything i think its a little on the large side for me i ordered a small im   lbs super comfortable the inner layer is very soft once you wash it the outside is soft too ive already worn mine several times happy
i really wanted to love this dress but it was so short im only  so i dont consider myself really tall but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt way too short for me my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt 
theres enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse sorryhad to say that all kidding asidesince its been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like this is no exception it is very billowy flouncy and roomymore so even than todays peasant styles i think it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest so thats how i ordered my size and it worked i think if one sizes down

this top is so pretty and feminine the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves the fit is true to size i usually wear a size medium or  in retailer tops and the size  fit quite nicely this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well
the fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird the top was fine but it became a bit tentlike in the waist the material doesnt feel great either
is not a place i want to be even if the style of a sweater is great  yes this sweater is very cropped but i think  definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit   the itchiness that makes it an immediate ampquotnoampquot and  coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance
the combination of vintage and bohemian styles seems as if it would be flattering on all figure types and i love the combination of smaller and larger prints the only thing i didnt like is that on the blouse i received placement of the larger print on the bodice is asymmetrical unlike the photo it might not bother some customers but it wasnt what i was expecting so i ordered a new one i may keep it even if the second one is off because other than that small thing i think the top wou
saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store i usually wear an  or a  depending on how things run im a  dd so i tried on both sizes i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get the  was just a tad looser so i went with that one but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference it is a very figure flattering top and a plus that you can machine wash it simply awesome
this knit dress is very comfortable i liked the various colors used in the stripes my only issue with it is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short in my opinion this dress with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves would appear more proportional with a longer skirt skirt length along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me regrettably i sent it back
this is one of my absolute favorites the design is perfect and the fabric is so beautiful i dont love the coral color but the mixed pattern is amazing it runs a little large i sized down one size and it fit perfectly its very flowy and comfortable its these unique special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases ive gotten so many compliments very highly recommend
beautiful colors especially the pink i am  and about  lb i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs not only is it short hemwise which i dont really mind but it is short in the waist very pretty and good fabric
i love the style of this top i just wish there were a slimmer version of it unfortunately this top doesnt suit my long slim midsection it is so wide it completely hides the waist i think it would look adorable on a different body type
i love this top not sure if i would picked it up in the store i received it as a gift from my husband kudos to him as it was a great choice i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality
ive admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room much to my delight im generally a sale shopper so this doesnt mean i didnt think it was priced well i have the oatmeal top with yellowgoldorange pattern on the skirt in xs the small fits comfortably up top but on my petite frame the top just looked too big so i went with xs i suppose the straps are a bit confusing but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin
i purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size i would definitely recommend this purchase
this jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on i almost didnt send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front or leave it open great looking casual but stylish and neat a good grey and a good blue
cute and pretty runs a little wide and short just slightly i feel like i have that issue with all retailer clothes though love the back
"wow the mixed reviews on this dress would make someone not get it at allit is true to size im a  and the six fit as a glove on methe material is not at all stiff i actually wished it was a bit more structured but that didnt bother mei was able to close the zipper by myselfim   the top feels confortable to me as well i dont considered myself curve like jlo but i have hips the dress does not make me feel bigger at allthe only down side is that it looks more expens"
this is a very cute and unique top i absolutely love the back which makes up for my indifference of the front im a little heavier in the middle so it hides it a bit but the light blue from the back that shows on the sides makes me feel a little wider its not perfect but i like it enough to keep it i got lots of compliments on it when i wore it its very comfortable too i just wish the front had a little more to it or was a tad longer overall very happy
this top is so lovely i was worried of the color on my pale skin but it is complementary nice warm tones yes it is a tank but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer jeans boots the xs regular is perfect for me length is adequate if i were to go with petite i might think it is too short it is flowy but still has shape more than a swing top so very flattering the back is really cute too definitely need a strapless for me due to the thin straps
well this top just did not do anything for me  its a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit youd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event but it was too buttonedup for my style i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me i didnt care for the feel of the fabric either although the lace is nice
i am   and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly its great for parties and weddings depending on how formal the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesnt look cheap nonetheless i love this dress and would definitely recommend
"love this blouse i took a chance on ordering it and wasnt sure what i would think this blouse is fabulous it has a bohochic flair to it in a sophisticated way its one of those special pieces from retailer elegant quirky sophisticatedthe details are great too of course the embroidery is beautiful but there are a couple more fun details the cuffs on the sleeve have multiple buttons so that you can button them tight or just enough to roll the cuff once when the cuff is r"
love this top it is super flattering with a long floaty body i usually wear a  but sized up to a  due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a  would have fit as well
i am   pounds and i bought the  the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating very flattering lines i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays as other reviewers said it is adorable and a winner
my store had this and i was so intrigued with its nearly  price tag that i decided to play dress up the colors in person match the colors online so that was nice to see consistency overall though i feel like a dress of that price would need to make me feel like a million bucks which it did not most items that fit my slender frame are too short and this was no exception the xs fit but i wouldnt be doing much moving walking or dancing in this dress which brings me to the question of

great little transitional piece i bought the blkblk floral one  its not your usual top sort of quirky  one of a kind looking i think its crazy comfortable  i just love it even its a bit chilly outdoors toss on a scarf round ones neck  head on out not the kind of top youd wear with a jacket
i was lucky enough to get a hold of this intarsia sweater dress after the sale and i wish i had purchased this the first time round it is absolutely stunning flattering comfortable and unique i am  and the regular hem fit me just fine at the ankles i think this dress runs both tts to a bit large so i would size down if your small framed and stay your usual if your busty or broad shouldered perfectly complements my taupe booties that i already owned and a my taupe maxi sweater that has
i purchased this top in a great sale fits greattrue to size i am xsmallsmall for reference purchased small i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable it would be great in the fall with a cardigan sweater or a blazer super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans
first my husband had to help me zip up in this interesting but awkward design the materials is nice but stiff so the skirt is quite full the shoulder idea is interesting but i would not want to spend an evening in it to me not up to the usual ms standard
i had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations it literally pairs great with everything fall chokers boots dresses you name it it also fits very true to size not too fit to your body and a little loose but not too loose just like a bomber jacket should i highly recommend this product
this is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up i ordered up a size after reading other reviews although i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably i ordered the black and it is not see through its very light weight and comfortable i may even order in another color just because its so great to wear around the house
cute top the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front its a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think its a flattering shape i got the regular s and dont find it too short for reference im   lb  i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit

uncertain about sizing i got both the   the  made me look like a noasser  neither fit quite right in the leg both hit at a weird point in my calf not cuteshort just off im  and  to quote my husband nope not feeling these that said they feel great on seem to be made well but are heading back to an retailer near you  sigh the quest continues 
i love the fit of these pants  theyre the perfect slim black pants however i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one but multiple places disappointed by the workmanshipquality of the product especially since the pants fit amazingly and dont sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product
i really love these pants just the right fabric not too thick so comfy i do feel they run a bit big they stretch out quickly so if you are in between sized choose the smaller one
like others i finally received my size  black pants after months of waiting  for starters these pants run small so i ordered a size up but still in petite because i adored the red ones i got this past summer  when the black pants arrived they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones which were also  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality  im debating ordering the regular length but im not sure ill bother based on some of the other reviews
i think this is the first time ive successfully purchased pants online i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones i gave it a shot with these and bingo they are great they are a bit longer on me than on the model because i am  and did not order a petite i still like how they look hitting just above my ankle just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads
this is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable yet cute i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique yet whimsical swimsuit style
this is a fabulous style top highly recommend this top comfortable material retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style
i dont typically write bad reviews but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway my fault i know the dress is super stiff  i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes im typically a  and the size small swallowed me and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust i ordered both sizes to try i wouldnt recommend buying this if you are a size  or small
i have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here i think it will look great over denim grey or olive green dresses and shirts
i think the model is wearing a larger size per the first review i am  and  lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous so you should order up if that is what you want this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it
the colors and print are absolutely beautiful and im quite heartbroken that this suit just doesnt fit i dont have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldnt feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for and while im only around a b
it is seldom that i write a review about a tee but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today i just felt compelled to do so the deal is this tee is pricey for sure but in my opinion it is worth it as another reviewer said the cotton fabric is hefty in fact it could also be called a lightweight sweater everything about this tee is perfect and classic the elbow sleeves the nice neckline and the semiboxy semicropped fit it will go with everything from jeans to nice slacks
i took this sweater on a recent vacation up north i wore it  evenings because the weather changed from hot to cool loved the feel of being wrapped in a warm blanket cocoon cardigan is an apt name wasnt sure about pink but it is exactly as pictured this will become a goto in my sweater wardrobe
this dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large and very small petitethinner ladies might feel its overwhelming it worked for me in my usual size l though for reference im  and this hit just above the knee and while the dress is roomy a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller  chest as theres not much give in that area i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous but a thin camisol
i bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too super cute with jeans can dress it up too the only slight negative if i had to find one is that i feel like i have to pull it forward at the neckline every once in a whileit doesnt choke me but just feels like its heavier in the back so pulls a bit worth it though 
i can never resist a peter pan collar so i bought this top in the ivory its so cute i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments its very comfortable fits well and looks expensive highly recommend it
i love this dress im  and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture i have slim hips and waist so that helps i dont think this would be as flattering on someone curvy i wish it came in another color i like i would absolutely buy in another color i got a medium and it fits like a glove
this is a cool relaxed style with the benefit of an open neckline to add a bit of femininity i tried on the faded blue and striped colors in the store the faded blue goes well with the style but the stripe is cute too the sleeves are quite long and too tight to roll up so if you are petite like me you will definitely want to order the petite size and probably even those you who are in between petites and regular sizes the sleeves may also be too narrow for some people
i think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online but i really underestimated the vneck of this suit i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast as im basically an a cup i figured i would be fine the top portion basically has no coverage or hold even when tied very tight the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either even

ordered the xsp  about  athletic buildthis was huge all over big in the armholes too much fabric hanging in the skirt cream fabric front and back not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model i love the idea of this and for the right body type of course this will be beautiful it also would not be a very versatile piece for methe top sweater part is quite thick lovely and heavy in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks
i love the way this tshirt fits the horseshoe opening in front is deep enough to add interest but not too revealing will look great with layered dainty necklaces the sleeves are nice and long  and i have long arms the length of the shirt itself could be an inch or two longer but overall the design is nice not too tight not too loose im   and  lbs   and the small fits me well fabric is medium weight  could be a little thicker the brick color is nice and works great with
the blue is a very flattering color the fit is not it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model instead there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section i think im going to return it the neckline is very nice and faltering the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting though and long it doesnt run big at the chest section just the mid section then tapers in at
this top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering i especially like the generous necklineadds a uniqueness to it great shirt for dressing down but still feeling feminine i bought two my husband always compliments me when i wear it
this dress is perfect im literally wearing it right now its crazy comfortable while still being flattering it looks and feels high quality and just barely doesnt hit the floor it makes me feel like a goddess plenty of room in the bust area even for me  and doesnt show bra straps or underwear highly recommended
i love this shirt the neckline is flattering and the overall feel is very comfy
i tried this on in the store and had to have it this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything im a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves i highly recommend it
i love these tights so much i almost want to buy another few pair and save them for when these wear out the lining is like clouds on your calves theyre thick enough that you dont need to be totally covered by a tunic but slim enough that they dont add bulk love love them
"i was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on i am  with curves and usually buy a large in dresses this dress looked like a sack on me the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i dont think it flatters hourglass figures it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers obviously based off the"
i saw the cream color in size regular small in the only one left section at my local store i had my heart set on this dress all summer but it was sold out so i was super excited to see it the color is true cream like linen color i was surprised that the dress is very heavy as heavy as a medium sized coat i cant understand why its so heavy because the top is sleeveless and the dress part is pretty sheer the dress is about  pass my feet which i wouldnt mind having it hemmed but the
i am long waisted and   lbs  that being said i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly a petite would have been far too short so i would recommend a regular size if youre a petite also i have a big chest and this was very flattering because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck but this classic peter pan collar looks great i purchased the black i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave the black and white o
i loved this in the store but had to order my size it is true to size  a great length  but the material is very thin and very sheer i dont think it will carry over into fall  it is more of a summer weight fabric it is also a little pricey for that same reason  still  its a great basic and i will keep my eye out for it to go on sale
i saw this dress in the window at the portland store and had to try it on i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it onsort of like wearing a tent no shape at all one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress ive ever had on its romantic elegant feminine the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic i cant say enough about how amazing it makes me feel i wore
i ordered size large and find it too boxy and long love the hem although the top is too long in this size so its a bit hard to judge how itll look in the right size the sleeves are cute and different a bit wide and flowing be warned its sheer which is more apparent from the side view i could clearly see the garment cleaning instruction tag through the bottom side hem has potential but not enough for me to reorder in a smaller size
this is a beautiful and fashionable blouse it feels good on as it is made of viscose it is pretty and feminine color is great of course it needs to be your color i love it and recommend it
i fell in love with this top when i tried it on at the store its a great fall piece it is seethrough around the bust so a nude bra or any color camisole would have to be worn my only thing is that it seems a little dressy so im wondering how much ill wear it i work from home so everything has to be somewhat casual so i do recommend it but im undecided as to if im going to keep it for reference im a  with a thin upper body and took a size medium
ladies this top shrinks i am very disappointed i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount i did not use a dryer i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk it is a lot shorter and much tighter especially in my arms if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit
new fav lbd i am  months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again it fits right above the waist with a bow to cinch the waist love the fit and flare the top is warm great for a cold evening out and the taffeta really dresses it up love
i love the back detail but doesnt feel that comfortable on i bought in green its fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up im  and bought xs size i should have ordered the s
i was on the fence about this jumpsuit at first  i feel the pockets in the back are a little high on my bum  kind of an unnatural placement  i sized up so it wasnt so tight fitting at the waist and hips so it made the placement of the back pockets a little better
i tried this tunic on in my local retailer store they do not carry petites so i tried on a regular small im   the proportions were a bit off the vneck fell way too low and there was extra material puckering across the bodice i definitely think a petite would work better for my height alas no petites instore or online in the colors i would purchase i didnt find the shirt too thin as some have commented its essentially a midweight tshirt material but rayon so beware o
i do think the fabric could be a little more substantial for the price and was disappoitned that even petites were again too long the color is nice enough neutral and they definitely look like work pants they are true to sice but i could do the low end of my size range
after seeing this on anthtos facebook page i was so excited to order i ended up going to a store and trying on i couldnt believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it i thought this ran quite big and the shape was odd lots of material in the middle i am a mom of  young kids and didnt want people to think  was on the way
i ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve i am very disappointed because i love the sweater by the time it arrived it was sold out in my size now i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged if the sweater was not damaged i would recommend this product
this tunic is very pretty in black it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely im  so i ordered the petite but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings with jeans the petite length will work well i recommend using the size chart provided i general wear an xs but ordered the s based on the size chart its a perfect fit
cute cute simple tank with a little something to add interest
i love the soft slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket dont expect a crisp fit im not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer the onebutton closure is easy to wear the hem curves for a more feminine look i hesitated before ordering hoping it would turn up at my local retailer by the time i was ready to order the green version had sold out as it turns out the copper is even better it was  degrees today but i wore it anyway
i ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return  which is one reason the top went back as well it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top but it came down to the price i just didnt think it said  hopefully its still around when it goes on sale its very cute fits true to size
these leggings are soft comfortable and go with everything love the way they feel
i just adore this top it is so comfy and stylish i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom like other reviewers have mentioned though the straps are way too long i had to cut them down and resew to make it wearable before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful i tried layering under it which looked absurd
i rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans the pants are so comfortable and flattering love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up i am in my  and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age retailer is my favorite store
i ordered these in both the grey and moss and i love both they are very soft very easy loose fitting casual shorts i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured so they hit lower on my leg than on the model which i prefer in these i am   lbs ordered xs the dark grey ones feel more versatile like you could throw on anything with them and go the moss look cute with whitecream summery tops they washed well machine cold laid flat to dry touched up with light steam from
quality is fantastic but i feel like a  would have barely made its way around one leg this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a  a lot of fabric in the legs nice pant but not for this girl
these run small i am  and got a size  they were a tad tight on top the waist fit but felt a little too snug short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material they are a dark blue animal print i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle they looked so silly i had to laugh even with the  off these are going back not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person
i did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy underlayer i can see it now in the photo but i just thought it wasnt part of the actual vest when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing underlayer was part of the design i dont know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it in my opinion the underlayer takes away from the beautiful vest i guess i could have spent some time and removed it but at that price i just sent it back too bad because the m
"i think this may almost make it back to the more classic pieces retailer used to have i tried on the xs in store so i ordered the xxs and xs petite i felt the usual xs was a little big again i think retailer is making things bigger my verdict is iliked the length on the regular size better and the xxs fit well but not much difference the xs petite was a similar size be the arm hole was highercolors are very neutral and warm i like the addition of the inner layer to make this more wh"

when i saw this online i thought it was going to be a thin summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it it is not thin and wispy but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings the zipper pockets look cool too would definitely recommend
this dress is so beautiful the color is even more vibrant in person a stunning emerald green it is well made and doesnt go too low under your arm which sometimes happens with halters the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top look at the back view photo online you can see it there at first i was surprised by it because i didnt see that on the front view but then i decided it was fun and flirty i received numer

these pants are perfect they are exactly what i was looking for and worth every penny the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim but still i think i could wear these any season they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t so excited to have these in my closet love a good pair of fun pants
this top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast i purchased the red and hoped that it was more of a rust colorlucked in the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layeringwhich is alway a plus i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of themin fact the stripes do the work and disguise and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker you wont be disappointed
i got this skirt in the dove grey which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you cant see in the photo the other layer is the grey netting it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should im   the skirt looks just as it is pictured i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit very very pretty and well made im happy with the purchas
an interesting design in a highquality garment  fits true to size on me and is great for layering  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i wouldve gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece
sits at waist length is perfect for petite quality is very good looks very nice on me very recommend
i purchased the coral version and the color is wonderful and vibrant it fit my daughter beautifully and she is  i think she will be wearing this coat often she loves it she is  years old and has a professional job so she will look the part
just purchased this coral coat today the color is beautiful the quality is excellent and the coat itself is lightweightgreat for travel great purchase and would recommend buying going to new york and cant wait to wear it  love love this coat
i love the feel and design of this pullover it is extremely soft and comfy to wear however i did find that it runs slightly large is a bit boxy and the sleeves are a bit lengthy probably not the best for a petite frame i am trying to decide if i should keep it though simply for the softness and ease of wearing that it provides
i really did not need another coat at all but i couldnt resist got it in green  its dark and woodsysomething robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish the structure is just right  this coat is soft cozy and fluid but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment equally wellsuited to wear on winter eve dog walks to a football game or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table works with most of my wardrobe 
it pills a little under the arms and picks up lint but its totally worth it this is a fabulous sweater coat i receive compliments on it wherever i go so cozy warm  delicious not too hot to wear indoors either its breathable love it bought in green during black friday sale highly recommend
this sweater dress is lovely quirky and comfortable because i have broader shoulders the neckline was perfect on me although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm the dress skims in a very flattering way at first i was dissapointed it wasnt more formfitting but it drapes very nicely i usually wear a size four in dresses and chose the small in this dress which was best i think it has a built in slip that is a bit flimsy so i will probably wear a long silk one th
this is a comfortable sweater dress and the quality of the material seems good the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf i decided to pass
i ordered this in the orange color from online they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium regular i liked it but just not flattering i am  and the coat was too big sleeves were past my hands i think because im curvy the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small it was a nice coat just not for me
i love sweater knit dresses and this the first one ive owned with a flare style that works pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a nonobvious way i think the fabric is soft and warm i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint you may want to size down if youre not busty i am  and m petite was the perfect length on me shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in  days
this dress hung so nicely on my figure small up top bigger in the hips that i couldnt pass it up the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos it might run a little smallim normally an extra small but it was a little snug in the arms however the small was too big so i would suggest sticking with your usual size the saleslady said would stretch a little i would have loved to try a petite but the store didnt carry petite sizes it will be my goto holiday dress
love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days i love the squishy soft feel of the material it works well with sweaters love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet i love how simple and practical this coat is the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head
ill start with saying that its a beautiful coat i get tons of compliments and love the color it runs a little big but its meant to have to a slouchy oversized quality to it my only complaint is that ive had it for about  weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate theres no extra buttons to replace the old one with and im worried more of the coat is going to fall apart super bummed about the construction qu
i bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think itd be great with some leggings and boots as well if you want a more structured look go a size smaller i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large the coral is beautiful
i love this dress will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow it fits well the neck line is a bit low on me i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it as shown on model i am   and  lbs and the small is just right
i am   lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small these were really baggy in the thighquadricep area and made my thighs look bulky the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed
"this sweater is perfect finally a sweater that doesnt make me look like a huge boxi bought the blue  it has other colors running through it so ill be able to wear it with chinos  jeans very pretty flattering  i think im going to be wearing this a lot"
cute and comfy shirt tts got my usual m im a  and it has a generous fit but i think its supposed to its actually a silver grey color
i would highly recommend this top i usually wear a small petite but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly there is a lot of fabric but if you size down it wasnt an issue for me i weigh  and am  feet tall also im busty  d which worried me with this type of top not a problem i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this i am very picky and i was happy with the quality the fabric is not heavy its a fantastic purchase
this top is really cute and i think will be a great transition piece im glad i tried it on in the store as it runs very small i typically wear a  or  and bought this in a  they didnt have it in stockso i ordered it and hope it fits
i just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful its actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture theres different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small  so it runs tts and i didnt find this overly blousy myself though thats just part of its charm youll need an undershirt or something
beautiful dress but have to return way too big  long for me medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small
"this swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations im   lbs with an athletic build and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is  i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium the material is thick high quality and the colors are exactly the way they appear online the top is reversible and the alternate side is teal and nude i feel like i got  tops in one sinc"
im  around  lbs muscular and petite so i ordered a petite small and it fits great the length is perfect i can wear with heels or dress down with flops its lined which i think most dresses and skirts should be so i was happy about that i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides to show a little legsexy its not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline so thats plus my only issue was the fabric didnt line up on me the same as the model
"as soon as i saw this dress i knew i had to have it i just tried it on and it is beautiful i feel gorgeous and glamorous i cant wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attentionthe silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the looki am   and i purchased the small petite its slightly big around the armholes and it kind of poofs  puckers out so im going to"
i always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant cool tone not orangey i fell in love with this one in person it jumped at me in the store but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice if you like to cover your assets you will love it
i bought this in both the taupe and ivory the beading on the neck line the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt i bought a size  which is normally what i wear at retailer so i would say it is true to size i really like the length of the top it hits midhip on me it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it i bought it to
i order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled therefore i knew it would have to ironed a lot it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back i didnt realize that this shirt was two different fabrics overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite
"i havent worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it hoping that itll fit me i love the swing skirt and the halter this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood there is a side zipper i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model it is unlined but with the color of the dress i dont mind it"
i agree with the other review that the dress runs big and long but i love it its very flattering and i have super high wedges that work great with it i dont think it runs super big but its slightly big definitely size down if small busted i wore it out and got a ton of compliments its classy different and hot
i definitely recommend this shirt its lights and airy something you can wear everyday
oh yes another sequin top to add to my collection it is sparkly without being glittery if you know what i mean can definitely dress down as it is tee shirt like lots of options for this one tts  much better in person than the online pics
unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants great feel theyre soft and the grey is a soft color
if i could sew id take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape after ordering a bigger size the fabric is just as it appears online  totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it however this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear its also too small in my goto skirt size and i order a lot at retailer the waist and hips are small making the skirt too short as well but the bottom flares out ridiculously i ordered two of
i bought these in the olive green in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online i am   and  lbs long legs and these are beyond adorable some people mentioned that they stretched out i did not find this to be true what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down they are flattering and perfect for the springsummer i would highly recommend and wouldwill purchase in every color well done retailer one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring
i love the flower patterns they add feminine touch this legging is well made with good quality spandex the only cons is the color is not as deep as the picture when you wearing it and the fabric stretched the color looks much lighter other than that its a good buy
"i ordered these as i was curious of hte fit on my body type shorter thighs well it was ok but in the end i dindt keep them as i would be better off wearing jeans on casual day or real joggers as in jogging materialcut was ok not super flattering but tapered pants only suit stright legs in my opinionmaterial was nice enough dindt notice wrikling but i didnt wwear them jsut tried them ongrey color was nice"
i loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly the arm holes are entirely too big  so big that alternations couldnt fix it maybe its because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw
"was so excited for this top loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material making it look blousy than showing on the model they must have pinned it back in the stock photosadly its going back"
these leggings are beautiful so unusual and colorful comfortable and flattering they fit truetosize with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape the fabric is a bit lighterweight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesnt mind attracting a little envious attention

i totally love this tank the yoke detailing is so pretty i read the other reviewsi feel it fits pretty tts its what i expected i have already worn it several times since it arrived in the mail i love it so much im ordering it in the turquoise color as well every time i have worn it i have received compliments ive worn it alone with shorts andor jeans as well as with a cardigan and dress pants for work its soft comfortable and to echo what another review stated the material s
"i like the idea of the pullover the quality of is nice the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touchi expected this sweater to be more flattering though it is true to size but the length is strange it seems a bit too long yet is too short to look like a longer tunic or maybe the waistline is a little low whatever it is it makes me look like i have short legsalso the collar wont stay down the way it is shown in the picture but it may work better for someone wi"
a lovely skirt and im so glad i found it before the medium sold out having said that i expected the medium to run small and that id have to squeeze into it but having tried it on this evening its not the case at all i nice fit i might even have fitted into a small which i think is the only size remaining the skirt is very spain inspired very flamenco i love it i will say that youd need a bit of height to wear this skirt due to the length at the back im  which is tall enough fo
"first the good parts these are adorable in person and i think the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures the green isnt too army green its a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds whites blues pinksvirtually any colorthe tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice they do seem to run a little large so id size down if youre between sizesand now sadly the bad these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a"
i adore these little joggers i was immediately drawn to the color army green and the little details i carry all my weight on bottom so i dont often wear many retailer bottoms im usually a  i tried the xl on just to see how they would work and i was pleasantly surprised they are absolutely perfect they fit a little baggy as joggers do and go with just about everything mine did loosen a tad but not like the previous reviewer i highly recommend these cant wait to wear these throu
these leggings are beautiful and different the material is very stretchy sort of a spandex feel panty lines definitely show in the back i found they run true to size i wear a size  in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great
"this pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pici found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others didnt the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for springoverall cute especially for the price if not on sale i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome"
i love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it the fabric is a great weight flowy but still substantial enough with nude undergarments i cant see anything in fact that is one of the things i love no special undergarments are required so it is very comfortable and still very flattering i typically wear a medium  pounds    waist  hip i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big i would have bought it but the salesperson suggested i try
i love these pants i have them in navy and carbon the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy they loosen up as the day goes on as well super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break
this is a lovely piece with great shape and details i think it would really stand out at events i ended up returning it i dont have much occasion for cocktail dresses i had trouble sending it back it has a slip with the sheer overlay the slip seemed a bit tight at the bottom hem for the shape of the dress
nice flowing summer sun dress i was looking for something very simple and put a colorful kimono over it i put a bando under it i think this dress can be for all ages as my friend in her  bought and loves this dress as well
this is one of those dresses that is just nice and can be one that you go to in a pinch it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down its not the best quality in fabricbut if it was all silk you would have paid  i like it it fits wellits not outstanding or unusual i think it is a bit pricey for what you getbut its a work horse dressit will do you right whenever you need it to
i was worried at first that the metal leaves would come off easily i was pleasantly surprised after a day at disneyland i dont think i lost even one of them this dress is super fancy but very comfy
id been eyeing this for months loving the look but afraid itd be too young for me im  i tried it on in the store and loved it with one caveat it hangs rather like a sack so i think it needs a belt for waist definition with a belt it looks great my measurements are  and i wear a medium oh and contrary to what other reviewers have said i dont find that the fabric is too thin or transparent
i love this dress i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip it is beautiful and is so comfy it looks good with heels or sandals i definately recommend this dress it would look good on any body type
this top is cute and could be worn to work or casually being tall i love how long this shirt is definitely recommend
i bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play highly recommend
i always look for things to hide parts without making my parts look even more pronounced this top is much cuter in person than online it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didnt notice the length is perfect the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin even though it has stripes perfect spring summer top
"fit is true to size but keep in mind this dress has a boxlike fit i am debating whether to have mine taken in a little under the armsthe material isnt what i expected but i still love it the dress has a more texturedthick fabric instead of the light somewhat silky fabric that the photo portraysi am very happy with the color"
ive been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had  off i really dont think its worth the price and its not very flattering i think it would look better on someone less busty  it seemed to accent my bust its definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning

this is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans and they were worth every penny i love the fit the distressing everything about them they make me feel like i look amazing which is what good jeans should do i wear a  in pilcro jeans but based on some reviews went up to a  in these and they are perfect also im  but the crop length hits at my ankle which is perfect
it looks great on the model but not on me on me it looked more like a sack of potatoes the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion it is very thick ill be returning it because it is not flattering on me
i love this dress it has a beautiful european flair and more beautiful in person i dont agree with the other reviewers that its see throughthe fabric is a good quality and thicker than you would think the variable length is the best part of the dress the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow
i love the idea and color very flattrering and easy to trhrow on however i need the petite in this one and they sold out in the neutral color it looks too big in eregular sizing and since it combines xss it is made slightly bigger material is soft enough
i received this in the mail a few days ago and was so pleased with it except that it was huge i am normally a  in most things so i ordered a large i was swimming in it in all areas  shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i dont look larger than i am i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking
everyone has said it so ill just add my two cents  this is a great soft flattering top i bought two one in white and one in black and i have never worn them without getting compliments i sometimes wear them buttoned up and sometimes completely unbuttoned to expose tanks or bathing suits i live in florida and these tops make great beach cover ups i am  and over  but not busty and the medium was swimming on me but i think this particular shirt is supposed to be that way su

i wanted to love this top but it unfortunately did not work for me the material has a nice weight and feel to it and while i love the pattern the shape leaves something to be desired the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top for reference i am   lbs and typically a size  i wear a small in retailer clothes and got a small in this top i think an xs would have been to

i purchased this top in white it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one i purchased the xs but wish i had bought a s the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons for reference i am  weigh  lbs  bra size  jean size and small boned i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist my normal weight is  lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh
picture definitely does not do this vest justice  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel  i am    lbs  size  and the small works for me  the vest will work with ivory black grey and red underneath  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look  there are small pockets in the front as well  definitely worth the  asking price
im very pale and on me the rose color looked really washed out the catalog photo is not an accurate representation look at the product shot for a truer representation its slightly seethrough and was too close to the color of my skin i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin though
"bought this top in white and blue motif it fits me great and looks adorable the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but its an easy fixthis top looks great dressed up or down would definitely recommend"

"this light blouse is beautiful and true to size i ordered the black one and love iti would recommend this product"
wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy does not give any shape to the body do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest
agree with other contributer  this is a great piece to snag on sale i bought this  months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly  which is does well i think it fits true to size im typically l and this l fit well i can see how certain body types it would look maternity but im short and curvy and the blouse is flattering its lightweight so i plan to add a cardigan in the fallwinter

this beauty arrived in my store todayand despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests i just had to have this one ive always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vestbut im curvy and always feel like those add bulk this one only has sherpa on one side the softest most cozy sherpa ever and its not too bulky the print is even better than it appears onlinein fact the vest almost appears pink online and its not in person there is much more variation in color in person i adore

i read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me but it did not i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame overall it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else if youre tall and slender i think this top would work
"ive been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughters first birthday party since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it it does drape nicely"
i usually wear a size   the fit was perfect highly recommend many compliments
i fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it in store i tried it on immediately and knew i had to have it it fits a little big  definitely size down but other than that i have never felt more beautiful than when i wear this the color is a perfect blush pink and the drop waisttiered skirt make you feel downright bridal when wearing it despite it being the perfect fabric for day i find that this dress is perfect for those days at work when i have an event later it can be dre
this is a very flattering  soft sweater the pockets make it so much cuter  do not make me look thick highly recommend
this is such an adorable tee the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee i tried the xs and at  and  pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me love this tee and highly recommend this one
i purchased this poncho online in the cream color when it arrived i tried it on to decide whether or not to keep it i immediately went on line and purchased the taupe color  as well thank goodness it didnt come in  more colors this sweater is so versatile and beautifully detailed plus it is very soft you take one look at it and you know the quality i think you could wear this dressed up or down and it would be perfect either way i do agree it is not quite as long as pictured  but pe
i loved this dress on the material was quite different than expected almost a canvasy feel to it ran a little large but so cute
super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe  love the grey color and the material is super soft  glad i snagged this up for less than 
this a lovely piece you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details i typically wear xxsp or xsp so i did not expect this to fit but decided to try it because i liked the style as a petite many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents not this one the xxs fit nicely  just the right length and width i am  and  lbs i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos and not when you search for sweaters it
this top is really pretty and i received a lot of compliments on it i said it ran true to size but really the torso part runs a little big if i had sized down i think it would have been too tight in the arms the cami that came with it kept falling out which is no big deal but be aware that the strings might not hold the cami with the shirt overall its a really pretty blue and the details make it worth it
i knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top i get compliments whenever i wear it think hd in paris might be my new goto
another shirt i really wanted to love i adore green but so few tops are made in this color please make more however this shirt didnt work for me i think its a matter of where your curves live the shirt was true to size but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on probably a great shirt for different body types would love to see more green clothing
i wanted to love this dress and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide nipple tassels effect plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didnt bother me however the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did so close so sad
i found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area  it was fine for me as im not big busted
love this tee lightweight airy and comfy i think it fits true to size so soft and summery cant wait to wear it this summer
"this runs way big  i would recommend sizing down at least one size  possibly i got the design with divers  its fun and light for summer  soft material and very comfy"
although i love the soft feel of the sweater the zig zag design was very unflattering also the length is much shorter than appears in the picture i will be returning it
im not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringeit spoke my language love this dress feel this dress will work with many seasons dress falls nicely and feels comfortable i was worried it would be too long but with a  inch heelits perfect have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right
i have been wanting this sweater and decided to order when i received it there was no tag on the product it was not in a typical clear bag from retailer and it wasnt packaged nicely it came from reno nv most products i order do not get shipped from there it is short and im  most clothes that are short fit me with no problem this sweater might hit me at the waist or maybe shorter i think the color is nice and the sweater is soft but not what i wanted i am going to return it
i just couldnt resist this dress its blue its fun its feminine the color is so vivid and beautiful in person i was worried that the length would be an issue i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite but i feel that it is perfect it fits great and i know i will wear it a lot this summer
great fit perfect length so happy with these jeans the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel very soft  love these jeans
gorgeous fun dress but the cut in the armholes  petite is really low so low even a strapless bra peeks above it there are also lining issues could have been with just my one choice where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much back is stunning i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome it didnt work for my body because i have to wear a bra but i think its a winner for someone
tts and very very sleek and flattering just love for summer nice light weight feel great on and not saggy nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue
this top runs small across the top i was amazed at the materialpolyester i am surebecause the price was so high it has a sheer layer underneath which i think would make it hot in the summer i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online
i bought this tank in the blue popsicle print and i think its cuter in person than it is online the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special i am normally a size  and the small fits me perfectly also i appreciate that its lined i wore it with skinnies and received lots of compliments its the perfect tank for summer
i ordered these in my typical size  and they fit everywhere perfectly except the butt for me i found them to be too tight in that area i went to the store and tried on the  and they were too big in the waist i do recommend them though they are well made i loved the wash and the length was perfect being  they came to the lower ankle and that was fine with me give them a try hopefully they work better for you
i tried on the xs in the store  lbs  chest short fit i think it is a little big i would tend to go for a xxs petite in this for me the length was ok but would look more flattering in petite also the waist was on the looser side the green color is amazing though very flattering and springysummery the flow of the dress is also very nice the weird thing is the belt at the waist it starts a little off from the seam and doesnt go all the way around not sure if i love it or
i ordered this in the plum color which in real life just looks like a very very dark brown that would probably be okay but the dress is actually about  inches shorter than the listed measurements i ordered the regular length but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thighway way too short i am  for reference lastly i think the fabric is just awful quality especially for this price point the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself  worn ou
this is a great summer maxi dress i am   about a size  in dresses  i got this in an extra small i was really happy that on someone my height its just a few inches above my ankle so did not shorten me at all the straps were a good length and the waist hit at the right spot i dont think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra and skirt is lined the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric
this is like many reviewers stated a very flattering and nice dress the sleeves were particularly great because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty for lack of a better word part of my arm only exposing the slimmer bits it looked great on me and i imagine it would on most people i just did not like the handkerchief hemtoo young too trendy i dont know when youre in your  you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles i just didnt feel

this is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall im  and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee i could see it being very flattering on many body types i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side i bought the plumbrown color and am very happy with it
perfection i am  and the size  fit me like a glove beautiful color too highly recommend
love the style of this dress length hem waist details material i think it looks best on curvy women due to the waist detail only going part way around it doesnt give the entire waist definition which is why it would look best on someone who has a naturally defined waist this is a pretty unique dress which is one of the reasons i liked it i agree with one of the previous reviewers about it being hard to conceal your bra straps unfortunately for me that is a deal breaker because i rea
love the sweater the knit has a rich look and the fit is perfect i paired it with a printed pencil skirt for an eclectic look strongly recommend to your wardrobe
this is a nice shirt but i cant keep it i ordered a  and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am usually wear  petite in all pants and i think this size was perfect fit across the back perfectly when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach at the same time the high low styling makes for a really strange shirttail in the back im sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute
"im a  and i bought a small i found that the tube portion is pretty tight but probably needed to keep things up because there is not a clasp in the front or back it is really hard to get in and out of id probably be ok with it but the cups were too big for me i think i would need to be a c to fill itthe quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape i wish i could have made it work because it was really comfortable i returned it in the end"
this shirt feels so nice its heavier weight and so soft i think its lyocel such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering i am   and  and purchased a size  found this item to be true to size if not slightly loose but i love the flow of it highly recommend the green is classic and timeless very versatile

this bra runs very small and is hard to get on and off i think if i went a size up i would be happier
i tried these in store didnt have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me small waist and athletic fuller legs but surprisingly these work great they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend i do think they run a little small i am almost always a  but i took these in a  they didnt have a  in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight highly recommend

the sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand i was disappointed that the coat was so large i dont think it will work for me even with layers underneath its a great design but i may have to return it
this is a very well made top i love everything about this top bought it in both colors i think its fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it
i know this product description says oversized but thats an understatement i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their fathers jacket i dont even think an xs would have worked im  and about  pounds for reference i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but its just way too big
i love this blouse the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background the buttons on the front are also a coralpeach color and beautifully made its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze i ordered a medium which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly im a  and can run from an  to a  in tops i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can especially for women with a larger bust th
this top can be dressed up or down very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo blue i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in i think it might be too short otherwise
love the color cedar love the style sleeves are long and wide but that is the style biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped the length given in the product info is very short but when i received my normal size l the sweater comes to my hips just right the fibers are manmade acrylic so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s
love the print of this fabric  the length the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary
i loved the colors and the feel of the fabric it was a lovely dress but it fit weird on my  dd chest so back it goes the zipper had one spot where it was tight right at the widest part of my rib cage it was fine every where else too bad
i strongly disagree with the previous reviewer the shirt in our store was featured in all colors  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft  i felt like i was wearing a tshirt with an easy on and easy off feel the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit love
the weave is very loose and chunky which i like but isnt so apparent in the picture also the sleeves bell more than it looks like on the model the color is a great caramel and it fit tts i think it will be great on cooler days
i felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on the vest fits so well and the thick fabric feels amazing love the pockets like the previous reviewer i feel like ill be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit it has an ever so slight racer back so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it the draping in the front also falls really nicely great bu

this is a favulous capein fact i would buy another if there were other colors it is oversized playful chic dramatic and simply put a true statement piece it will not be flattering to your figureit is not suppose tobut it will show your true sense of style wish it had pocketsi may add them for more play
i saw the skirt on a display today at my local store i was attracted by the colors and the display itself my thoughts  give it a chance i bought the size  without even trying it on with the idea that the colors and style had so much potential i am so pleased with this skirt the fit is true although if you like a higher ride on the waist i would size down the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable i had so many staple items in my wardrobe that i wi
"this shirt is exactly what i expected it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great its the perfect shirt for summer loose fitting but in a flattering way the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colorsi highly recommend it"
the colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasnt cut for my body shape i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight updown to have it lay flat as in the model ordered size      tallslim build i also think the hilo hem of the dress isnt well indicated in the pictures im not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric

this is really cute  it has a boxy look and belllike sleeves the knit is chunky and so very soft i didnt want to take it off i purchased an xs in black its gorgeous my beige bra shows through so i will need to wear black or a camp underneath it feels really heavy  in a good way  and it feels like it will be really warm the black has a velvety look to it im smitten i should also mention that it did feel cropped to me  i know i read other reviews that said it wasnt cropped i fee
let it be known that i hate shopping for jeans i recently had my goto skinny jeans rip by my back pocket and new i needed to get something new  better stat i have a pair of black ag sateens that i got a few years ago and i decided to try out this pair i got them in the mail yesterday and i never want to part with them they are perfection they hit perfectly on my waist theyre incredibly comfortable and basically make you feel like youre wearing the jean equivalent to yoga pants they
great dress wish it came it more colors would like to buy another one i am  size small is perfect unlike one of the previous reviewers i do not think it is too clingy maybe she needed to size upvery versital cute with a jean jacket or long lightweight scarf booties or sandals 
ive passed this dress by a number of times online but ordered it on a whim on the mothers day promo based on the reviews i ordered my regular size medium it fit perfectly i do think the cut is on the trim side but it isnt tight or fitted i probably couldnt eat a big meal in this though as it would probably show in this dress the fabric is buttery soft the button placket down the front is very clean and lays flat there are two side pleats that are a different fabric and are ever so
i love this top i got a medium in black on sale i am  and  the medium fits great the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy which is nice  in my experience it is not too constraining contrary to other reviews however i think it depends on your body shape i am a cokebottle this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out note it is too lowcut for work wear very happy with my purchase
i bought this dress with my birthday gift and i do not regret it its so soft and feels like pure comfort but the details little metal buttons down the front the vent pleats on the side make it feel special i received many compliments and i would urge you to get this one if you are seeking comfort it was pretty true to size and because im an average height i wore a small block heel with it
i just received this in the mail and really enjoy it its a nice color and very gauzy airy the only think i didnt love is that its a little bit in the chest area which is rare considering im usually a m in that area
i wanted this top ever since i saw it online it is so me its a nice mix of feminine and masculine you can pair it with a nice pair of jeans or even business pants to dress it up this will make the perfect summer shirt and it hangs so nicely i highly recommend this shirt i would get it before its gone
i sized up based on other reviews which was good advice i am typically a size  but sized up to a  the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidlybut thats not me i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky
tried this romper on in store and wanted to love it but it just didnt fit me right ita great romper cute design super softlight fabric and overall a great feel but it doesnt work to well for short girls with any types of hips i have a very small waist and larger bottom and this romper just was very unflattering i couldnt get the tie waist to sit anywhere that felt like my natural waist instead it kept giving me a kangaroo pouch and hung on my upper thighs sizing up didnt help becaus
being somewhat on the fluffy side the style is very flattering and forgiving and will be ideal for summer i am between a size  and a  and the  fits perfectly light and airy a very nice simple embroidery in contrasting color very chic in an effortless way the armholes are just rightnot too big the color is definitely a creamy ivory worth the cost because i dont think it will be available for too long
"i am usually a size  in tops i am very very rarely a size  so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the  and assumed it would fit the way a  usually does obviously this is designed to be a loose flowing top thats why i wanted to order it however the  is simply too loose in every direction my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i dont think it intendedi do really like the styling and quality so i am planning on"
"these pants are so fun i love the pattern and color can be dressed up or down very flatteringhighly recommend trying them on they were better than i expected them to be"
i bought this today in a size  fits perfect i am normally a  or  or xs the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested because it is not long in the front i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape it is on the shorter side very nice material and design as well as details overall good pick
i tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love im a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips this dress made me look and feel slimmer and is light to wear the dress is a perfect length too im  and this dress hits me right at the ankles if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual this one is perfect
i loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away i purchased a s and the fit was very off the arms were long which i dont mind but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it
i was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant the design is unique and provides visual appeal and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place i love the high waist on these

the blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top however the xs was just swimming on me this looks much more fitted in the pictures my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for  months where are the fitted tops ill keep looking
this is not worth  it looks cute on butthere is no support in the bust area just a slight tuck in the fabric it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning ill look for something else i havent bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasnt slipped  i will look for another option
its hard to go wrong with the charlies especially in this fabric keep them coming i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well they fit pretty true to size id say try both your usual size and one size down as well they stretch out a little so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric try wearing a burnt orange green or pink the isabella sinclair grid wrap but

when i first pulled this shirt from the box i thought it was a for sure winner the beading was stunning it was just so elegant and the details are perfection till i tried it on and had some reservations the sleeves at the top were very poofy and just would not lay in a flattering way unless they were rolled above my elbow to tighten them and as a taller gal i wish it were a tad longer in the model shot looks a bit short from the back view i fear tucking it would loosen the bead work
so i actually loved this skirt the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together and its rare to find something thats simultaneously so formfitting and comfortable but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work especially with that long slit  i might feel differently if it didnt have that slit because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office if
i love this vest get compliments every time i wear it its stretchy too  unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there so little tip dont spill on it lol my fault though so still  stars
i have been eyeing this piece for months now i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock i am   and  lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs i think the top is too baggy for me yes the top and bottoms fit overall but it doesnt look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model it is very sheerwhich is the thing that discourages me the most i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work which i am willing to work on s
i order this sweater in black  size small  and i just love it im a slender    lbs and the small is perfect in for me while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized boyfriend feel to it the rounded front hem hip pockets and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem where the rounded hem begins are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailers clothing the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality but it is perfect for my minneapol
ive been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger im glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl they are really sweater tights i think this aspect is great but they do not have as much give as other tights i am petite about   lbs and the small

i expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isnt i ordered the xs and im swimming in it im  and  lb would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like youre wrapped in grandmas table runner
this top is just as beautiful in person as online however it has two issues for me  it is too short this might work if you have a short torso but it would forever show my stomach  the fabric has way too much static cling no matter what i tried it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides not attractive in short if you have a short torso and dont mind battling the static this truly is a beautiful top
these tights are so cute and can add some fun to any outfit i paired with a mustard mini denim shirt and desert boots they do run small i am a size  and had to get the ml
the bright poppy red is gorgeous and the cut flattering and interesting im usually between a m and l in tops but went with a s in this one because it looked too sloppy in my usual size im a  d with arms that arent tiny and its a bit tight across the shoulders when i reach forward but not enough to be a problem in the smaller size it skims my hips nicely but isnt as long as pictured on the model i would suggest pearshaped girls size down if inbetween it is sheer but not so much
"i am short on the heavy side   lbs i always wear large petite this beautiful blouse swallows me lots of fabric on the front side of the shirt causing a boxy look i could totally do a mp if not sp i am going to try and exchangebeautiful blouse great quality breathable fabric colors are deep and rich so comfy highly recommend"
adore the rust color in this top very pretty rust color would go with a lot of stuff my only small pet peeve with the shirt is the opening under the hook and eye i have been wearing a seamless tank underneath but everything else about the blouse fits so perfect drapes nicely that i think the opening is a minor thing that a tank top can fix beautiful on felt that it fit tts im usually a  got an xs in this top
i love layering this over basic tees or graphic ones like the wild west tee  it adds just the right amount of edge currently building my pin collection to add on vintage turquoise and rock music to be exact
"these tights are so cute but the sizing leaves much to be desired i guess they are true to size since they are labeled smim  with shorter legs than torso and i suppose im lucky that i have muscular read large quadsthighs to suck up some of the fabric otherwise these might have just bunched up at my anklesthe other thing i dont love about them is the feel of the fabric  its more sweaterlike and not a soft sweater than stretchy maybe that was the intent but i find tigh"
i had to have this when i saw it in a store i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors i wore it for the first time today with a black tank on me it looks best unbuttoned it looks good with pants the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms i have muscles so i dont think i could wear it with any top with sleeves
i really like this vest personally i think it is difficult to find vests that fit properly this is a good one fabric and color good the photo is very representative of the color no surprises there arm holes are not too big which is often a problem the detail on the back gives it some added interest the only thing i would mention that could be a negative is that it is short especially in the back again the picture is representative but do pay attention to the length and be certain that
i didnt pay much attn to this online im not much on front hook  tie closures well saw today at the local store  decided to try on both the s  m i am usually a s in tops but the m was only a bit more roomy  longer than the s so i went with the size m i thought the styling of it paired well w the pilcro cord skinnys i had on looked much better than the pics online i have other pilcro skinny cords  jeans in vs colors so i think this top will work out well for me love the  sleev
im glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve but the sleeves do not fit loosely they kind of twist under the armpit area i do not have large arms so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves but they do not fit right i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline it is messy and tacky looking but i think that is how it was meant to be my recommendation to buy
at first i thought this top was going to be stiff i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is its lovely cream color with beautiful lace details i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go braless when its hot im   and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body but i feel this top is slight short on me that might be because i didnt wear it offtheshoulder but had it hang from the top of
perfect jean these jeans are comfortable the length is great and the rise at least for me is spot on my torso is fairly straight  not a lot of the hourglass thing going on  and somehow these jeans feel like they were made for me thank you pilcro
"the design is graceful and both my kids said it was a keeper pretty even the boy childsomehow i feel it makes my tummy look bigger than it is maybe with the belt on my jeans"
"unlike the other reviews i love this skirt the lining is a nice stretchy material as is the eyelet overlay making it a really easy to wear and comfortable skirt while still looking polished and professional   i bought it so that its slim fitting more like a pencil skirt ive only worn it to work dressed up with boots but suspect ill get a lot of use in the summer with flip flops and a tee shirt i highly recommend it and think its a great price it is longer than on the mode"

i love panties i love the prettiest softest most adoreworthy panties i can find these are my favorite boy shortsi can always put them on and feel pretty no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch im a mom and my body isnt perfect anymore but these panties give me confidence with perfect coverage i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer my only warning wash these pretties as delicates or the lovely lace colors will fade
"i love this dress so much the fabric on top is not something i would have chosenit is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one otherwise you would have to go with a straplessand the right kind of strapless with this dresswhen they say it flares it really doesand much more than i was expecting the bottom part of the skirt f"

i was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around the back has mesh strips that are see through there is also no lining to go with this skirt if you go back to the back view picture on the website and zoom in closely you can see the models black underwear
"i get so many compliments with this skirt i love almost everything about it i gave it  stars instead of  because i find the slit a little annoying i think its maybe a little too long or short i cant figure it out but i couldnt pass up this skirt because the pattern is so prettyfits true to size soft fabric very cute"
i ordered one of the xl in the red version the fit is true to size it matches the models photos the color is much prettier in person it looks washedout on my computer but in person its a nice light red the quality of the material is okay not as good as with the floral version of this style florascura tank the layers are flattering for my pearshape it definitely needs a tank underneath though not worth fullprice in my opinion but worth getting on sale
this skirt is everything i love about retailer the fit style and quality are amazing i feel like a am wearing a piece of art it is so unique and fits perfectly way to go retailer
i wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great regrettably i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room would be swimming in a m the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be the color was just as shown and beautiful hope it works for some of you out there
i tried this dress on in my local retailer and was pleasantly surprised it fitand looked cute as other reviewers have mentioned it runs small but it is super stretchy especially in the top portion with that said it accommodated my bust i have a  bust and it possess a problem for me when i try to buy dresses the top of this dress is pure elastic so it works the dress stretches on top but comes back inward on the bodyso i can show off my curves i have no idea what bra i can w
"the color design and fabric of this top got it in the red were just as i expected but as the owner of several deletta brand tops i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes and the top just hangs on me it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style will try an xs"
first i love this top overall it is simple and classic and has a flattering forgiving cut i agree there is a major design flaw as other reviewers have mentioned the vneck is so deep and falls so low you need to wear a camisole underneath instead i chose to take a stitch at the neckline to keep it together where i wanted it and that worked beautifully i think the top should have included either a small button or snap to hold the neckline up properly or should have been stitched together
based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium i have fairly broad shoulders and thought i might not fit my usual small if it helps for reference i am   lbs and wear a  bra i first tried on the small and didnt even bother opening the medium i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size with this blouse the buttons dont pull at a

wow im really glad i didnt listen to the negative reviews in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops the neck line i agree does need to be secured i wish they would have added a snap its fine though as i dont mind sewing it closed this top is worth it im   lbs and small chested so for slim girls i think this is perfect

"i have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist so this dress seemed perfect i ordered a size  petite which fit very well the regular two in picture was not as well made the straps didnt fit as well they were less of an x and way more fabric petite fit great i think this dress is really fun but not very mature i returned it because it didnt feel adult enough for the event"

this skirt caught my eye immediately i love the beautiful patterns and colors im currently pairing it with a charcoal grey top which works well the only slight concern is the material is a little poofy i still love it and definitely recommend this standout piece
it really is such a cute romper took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable that is in till i washed it im in europe so there arent dryers washed it in cold water linedried it and it shrunk significantly it still fits but the top doesnt blouse over like it previously did and the shorts feel really short so disappointed my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water
beautiful flattering dress love that you can where a bra without having to be concerned about straps showing very happy with purchase highly recommend
love these pants super comfortable but feel high quality i am usually a size  and the xs fits perfectly
i love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online its pricey but i am holding on to it because its really beautiful i got a medium im  medium built its just perfect im tempted to get the petite but with petite the top gets to be too short so i think ill stick with regular size my family loved it the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous you can easily dress this up or down
i am almost always an xs in bottoms sz  but literally couldnt get the stretchy waistband no zip or fastening in xs up my hips in addition the brocade is a very lightweight polyestery tinselly weavedoes not suggest quality as others have noted it also runs short im  and this was a little below knee length on me not anklelength ive had luck with retailers sale section in the past including some items that didnt always start off with the best reviews but have no regret
i feel like an indian goddess in this dress lots of swing to it
love the unique details and neutral color scheme top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my   lb frame its comfortable and well made thicker material  seems to be holding up fine after one washing  looks great with skinny jeans  highly recommend
"ive been wanting to add some cords to my wardrobe and had to give these a try i ordered the blue color online in size  im somewhat inbetween size  and  in jeans right now so i thought id be on the safe side and go up i ended up keeping these and im happy with my purchase although i do feel like the cut of the leggings is a bit off for me i am a proportional hourglass shape and i found these leggings to be quite snug in the thigh while being oversized in the waistin the end"

i really wanted the dark grey but it has been sold out in my size for many months i finally ended up with the navy i think they are much cuter in person the color nicer also i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd i got my usual size and the fit was perfect they stretch just enough i would get the second pair in a heartbeat

this might be one of my new go to tops looks cute with jeans and a sweater or alone the arms are snug but not uncomfortable and i think it adds to the shirt
these are really great legging style cords you can wear them without worrying about covering your bum in my opinion they are not too bulky at all which you might expect in a corduroy pant they are a tad loose in the waist area unfortunately but fit me well in the thighs so i dont think sizing down would work for me i bought the bronze and its a very versatile color darker than the picture but still a good color i feel it will be perfect for fall and spring especially ill wear it all

the flow and feel of the material is really nice however i think it runs large i ordered a small and i have exchanged it for an xs which i am hoping fits a bit better i wanted the pants to be a bit more fitted around the hips and flow from there

true to size length is perfect for  soft fabric not too low cut in the front but not all covered up either ruching is subtle and does not add bulk skirt portion skims curves neither clinging to them nor poufing out from them strap design is perfect covers bra while revealing a touch of skin comfortable and effortless to wear very very pretty
i feel like an indian princess in this dress it isnt very forgiving make sure you dont mind showing some skin  but theres some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times great colors boyfriend loves it

this dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer ranna gill i just love this gorgeous free spirited dress i bought the regular medium for my   size  figure it works very well i will want to wear a black cami as im not comfortable with some cleavage showing maybe  and the open lines of lacy small holes down the front and back you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami the top is not very seethrough and the skirt is lined the re
this dress is great and looks even prettier in person the colors are more vibrant the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect most maxis are too long on me but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect my only complaint is that it is very low cut which i was unaware of standing up but when i sat down at a dinner party well lets just say i gave everyone a show  recommend wearing a cami or something underneath
i ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews but i dont agree these are going back i ordered a small im  and  pounds i am usually between a small and a medium in pants but the small in these pants is huge i could definitely fit into an xs but i also dont think they are very flattering and dont like the feel of the fabric its too bad i love the idea of these

these jeans are wellmade the cut is decently flattering but on more muscular thighs it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher the petite on me was just below the ankle so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long if you are taller or have longer legs mine are short on my short height then i think these would be great i dindt find them particularly small but htey were snug muscular thighs overall ok but returning them  p ordered  lbs  in
kicky looking pants that i got at a bargain basement steal id be kicking myself if i didnt buy them cant wait to wear them once it warms up theyll look great with a lightweight boxy sweater and flats i tried on the  and the  and the  is perfect the fabric has a nice fluid feel to it i always swore to my husband id never wear plaids but i guess i lied
i was excited to try something by this designer and decided to order size large unfortunately this top just looked very odd cute from the front but it wings out in the back where the sleeves meet the arms the fabric makes an odd poof in that area i do have a large bust and it didnt pull anywhere in the front i expected it to be soft and drapey but the cotton feels very coarse and doesnt drape well it covered my behind in back unfortunately it made me look wide from the side view i hav

the retailer store had mostly white left of these pilcro linen pants so i tried them on the main reason i did not leave the store with them is because i could see the washing tag inside the pants as clear as day the white pants were just too seethrough and i was really looking for some casual items to wear to the office if it was at least lined these pants would have come home with me otherwise i think the fit was tts
these pants are flattering and comfortable plus they are cute cute cute im a little too conservative to wear them with a striped top but with a solid black or ivoryoff white top they are perfect can be work appropriate with a blazer or twin set or girlfriends lunch appropriate with a tee or turtleneck highly recommend
i never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt slip floral pattern pleats i literally feel like a princess greek muse in this dress cant recommend it enough true to size im  and  lb and got a size

i like the feel and color of this blouse however i was very disappointed with the sizing i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse it fits way too big it is a bummer because the curve is not even visible when i wear it
i love these jeans and have been wearing them a lot now that the weather is turning a bit cooler in my area i like that the cuff is not sewn in so you can wear them with a cuff like pictured or fully unrolleddown they are a bit higherwaisted than i prefer  kind of an awkward waist height in my opinion and they are very stretchy i was torn between two sizes so i went with the larger i wasnt sure of how to mark how they fit because they are somewhat fittedslim in the thigh area but th
i ordered this in a size s my usual size and it fits great i love the color style and fit of the dress the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of ever so slightly poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets other than that its pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under  so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler because of the rich color i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall
i would definitely only recommend this top to girls who are smaller chested it fits in the shouldersarms and then flares out too much at the bottom almost looks like a maternity top the material is very nice however  both soft and feels like it will hold up through multiple washes
i originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the  off dresses promotion a few months ago i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it but hemmed and hawed at the original price it was a splurge even at  off but as soon as i put it on i was in love this dress is so soft i wore it to see some old friends and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was the material is thick enough to have a decen
this looked like such a cute casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said it runs small im usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips however once on i couldnt figure out how id wear this i wouldnt pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didnt seem like a good idea either between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha
facing the mirrornear perfection high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the framepleats nicely hide any stomach flaws color is an eyecatching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful the problem is the walk away from that view the skirt waist finishes just where theres a bit of extra flesh the cut is more of a long alinefairly boxyand the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure so while the look as you approach walking
"im   lbs purchased smalli was going back and forth between xs and s i decided on small because it fit better in my arms didnt feel as tight the xs fit well in the torso area and didnt have as much fabric as the small the small also had a longer shirt tail if you dont have as much mass in the arms get the xs if you have some muscle or extra mass in the arms its better to go with the small"
okay i get the idea of the loose swing dresses but i have a couple that do it well without looking like a moomoo i ordered my typical pxs the length was good and the color beautiful i like the details of the dress but it was huge and not in a flattering swingy drapey way i was undecided if i should try the pxxs as the pxs was so large that i dont know if the pxxs would fix this problem for me i will still be thinking about it
i adore this dress the perfect summer dress that you can dress up or down the color is vibrant and the fabric flows and feels fantastic against your skin i love that you can still wear a strapless bra with it but with the adjustable shoulder ties you can have it go as low as you want for a more sexy look the bottom hem is this super cute fringe so fun and feminine and while it is a loose fitting dress i did not feel like my figure was drowned out by the fullness of the fabric this dress
i typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful more matte than shiny  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer
"its a lovely and unexpected sweater a few things to keep in mind  the knit details are beautiful the pictures dont do it justice its pretty lightweight the color is a little darker than the picture shown its a very dark plum it runs bigger this is the only retailer sweater where the sleeves of a m are a little to long  the style is decidedly casual and slouchy it looks great with jeans but dont plan to dress up an outfit with this piece"
this sweater was huge it hung down to my calves it also is really bulky and scratchy it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people im  and weigh  and i ordered a size s and i was swimming in it the fabric is very thick i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic it adds about  to your body frame
the picture doesnt do it justice i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing the fit is true to size i am large chested but it fit comfortablei did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest still looks amazing i feel very feminine in this blouse good quality material

i absolutely love this dress i feel its the perfect yearround piece looks super cute with boots or booties even with a cute baggy sweater over it i am usually a small or medium depending on brand im a small with this one and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back it just worked better that way it is not seethru though is a light material i live in fl so i can wear year round but up north with tights and boots you can too so worth the price
im so happy to add this lovely and unusual dress to my fall wardrobe i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on i wear a two or four depending on the designer and the two fit me perfectly another reviewer said its special occasion only but i like it so much ill wear it more often with that said its a wonderful goto dress for the holiday season
i ordered a  in this dress so it wld fall above my knees  be slightly smaller than a regular  sometimes a regular size  works sometimes a  typically a regular size  is big on me i am    just recd the  in the mail the first thing i noticed is that its s a knit fabric that looks  feels like polyester although says cotton on the inside label i think it wld be a bit warm in hot weather but that is just my observation the main problem is that it is too big on each s
i thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it either with opening in front or back it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure hook and eye or snap at the top it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily overall glad i bought it
went to the store in search of a butter dish tried this dress on a was shocked at how comfortable versatile and all over appealing this dress is im  and the medium hits at my knees  as always i think the quality could be better its not something that will last for years
i had my eye on this for a while and my store finally got it in in tmie for the  off sweaters too bad hte petite size was already sold out by then however good thing isthe xs stil lfit me in a nice way i wil lnever know about petite decided to jsut purchase as is they dont have xxs either the fit is on hte looser comfortable side the red color is rich and the design is subtle adn will nto fall apart so it add some interest to an otherwise typical pullover will look nice with j
this is a great dress for those days where you just want to throw something on but still look put together it hangs so well and feels so comfortable yet it has a style that is a combination of bohemian and part sophisticated  the colors are muted but they work so well i wear it with flat strap sandals and have also paired it with wedges i receive tons of compliments and have to make sure my daughter doesnt try to borrow it would highly recommend
i originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews although it did fit i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms i returned for a medium my usual size and it was perfect it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics i love love love that it is longsleeved and has pockets i went ahead and ordered the other print as well i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments highly recommend
i love everything about this blouse except for one thing the peplum just hits way too high up on the body and i am only   and ordered a regular size  not petite which fits perfectly except for this it is made of a beautiful textured fabric and is very nice quality i adore peplums and own many and like the peplum to begin near the waist however others may not mind the higher waist and in that case it may work for them i really hated to send it back it was so pretty but it just w
this will be a favorite sweater this winter it has a loose but flattering fit i purchased the red a deep rusty red and it fits me exactly as it does the model picturedslightly loose but flattering mid hip open neckline you cant tell in the picture but the neckline is rolled i am   lbs just a bit fluffy the small fits me perfectly i think that you could size down from your regular size if you prefer a closer fit the sleeves are at the top of my hands just below the wri
very versatile top i feel like i could dress it up or down fits very nice and the material is soft
i feel fabulous in this plum and charcoal vest i am  and the ml is the perfect length and size i was initially attracted by the external seams and color and was delighted with the silhouette and soft structure of the wool blend fabric it is versatile and yet a kind of signature piece that i will wear with joy 
this dress is very flattering i am writing a review to share my experience regarding sizing i am  and wear   i tried on a size  that was at the store as a return and there was about a  inch gap to get the side zip closed although i  normally wear a size  i ordered size  because of my experience with the dress at the store  the size  is slightly big across the bust but looks ok i think the size  wouldve been too tight
im not usually a fan of simple crewneck sweaters but this one has some nice added details that make it a keeper the dark red oxblood color is really nice it manages to be a red sweater without feeling overly holiday the detailing at shoulderchest is interesting yet subtle enough to not be distracting and doesnt feel bulky at all the dropped shoulder seams are done correctly and without the body becoming boxy it does feel like it might run a tad bit large but only very slightly not eno

i wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii i sized up when i saw the side zip because im a little larger in the top than bottom but whoa even when sizing up i think i would have needed to size up like  to get this to work the dress is adorable and if you have a smaller bust it will work for you so sad it wouldnt work for me
this dress is gorgeous its one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is i found it to fit tts although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam it fits perfectly if you have a bigger chest d i would foresee this dress being too snug however i am a c and it fits just right i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo
i ordered the grayplum colorway and while im disappointed in the large percent acrylic fabrication the vest is very soft and warm the unfinished raw seams add visual interest and im tempted to remove all the care tags and wear this inside out for a different look i am worried that excess pilling will be an issue so i will update my review if the quality deteriorates beyond a simple lint shave
"another reviewer said it best i love the way this dress makes me feel i couldnt agree more the lines are perfect and effortless with all the different reviews on size i went into the store to try it on i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress i am    and have a small bust"

super comfortable i am  weeks pregnant and i works great for me now and i think it will be perfect post baby also
loved this shirt so much that i bought in  colors love the luxurious feel of the silky flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways however after washing per instructions the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah pilled mess that gathers at the seams especially the bottom seam tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing looks like a cheap lackluster layering top now and definitely wont last another season so disappointed  if you ca
ordered this on a whim while taking advantage of a promotion and now need one in every color the weight and cut is perfect for fallwintersummer  not too heavy but not sheertissue thin fitted enough to look super cute with leggings or skinny jeans fabric has a nice quality feel to it  i have similar shirts from the past that have held up well in the wash im anticipating the same with this
i ordered this and hoped it would be a fun  whimsical sweater for this winter instead its just strange it didnt fit well too short in the overall length  in the sleeves the shades of the yarn were drab it also didnt seem made to last it looked like it would pillsnag in a short amount of time i returned it id love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future having a unique sleeve is a cute idea
i love simplicity in clothing and this tee fits the bill i put it on and instantly feel basic elegance
i am   pounds a medium is a perfect fit for me i love it not so sheer that i feel that i need to wear a cami underneath sleeves are long and it is so so so soft the scoop neck shows just the right amount without being too revealing i am buying one in every color
"this dress is gorgeous in the photograph and very pretty when it arrived however it is very dark in color you would only notice the blue in bright light or perhaps outside in the sun the fit was small i could not get the tie around the waist to look right and feel comfortable so sadly i had to return it i applaud retailer for the excellent and attractive packaging that was almost enough to sell the dress it came in a very nice white box inside a larger box tissue paper and fol"
love these pajama bottoms they are so comfortable and the print is fun and unique i highly recommend they run true to size and have a great length they look short on the model but mine are perfect
"this shirt is pretty but wasnt worth the price in my opinion the shirt does a pretty decent job of staying closed at least and the embroidering is pretty but i could tell the material wouldnt last very longalso i like my shirts loose fitting but this one looks more boxy than flowy id probably still buy it if it were cheaper"
i love joggers best style to come along in awhile i think these are well made and i like the fabric i just wish the leg were cut a bit slimmer but thats just a matter of preference i definitely like them and will keep and wear
i purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive but the other colors were not even in the same material but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex
ive been looking for a staple longsleeve tee for a while now and i think ive found it i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect the material is soft the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places the sleeves are long enough which can sometimes be a problem for me the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long ill be back for more colors
if you have any cleavage this dress will look awful the ties drop pretty low  look trashy over cleavage recommend otherwise  good fabric cool look
i have the blue and holly joggers i absolutely love the fit  feel and color of the joggers the oddity is that the elastic at the waist bunches in the blue pair but not the holly it drives me crazy i could only wear the blue for a couple of hours before i had to change into something else unfortunately the holly joggers were in the wash  im going to take the blue joggers to the seamstress maybe she can fix them   small was perfect
i wanted to love it  the color is great the embroidery pretty but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer
i tried this shirt and really loved the feel and the scalloped sleeves i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery and i always find myself drawn to their clothing the fit wasnt too boxy on me but im between ml and sized down so that might have helped if i didnt have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up
the fit and feel of this top is lovely great shirt to layer fits great i get compliments every time i wear it
i was excited to receive this top it looked great online vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves when i tried it on the fabric looked and felt cheap it is not a flowy top do not recommend it
i definitely would recommend this top when i put it on i felt it was true to size and fit me very well sometimes my retailer tops tend to be a little roomy but not in this case the fit was very nice and its embroidery details make it a special look that i can throw on with my jeans and still look put together i know this will be a top i wear often
i ordered these joggers in holly size m for reference i am   lbs i have a small waist with thicker thighs and bum i was worried that these would make all my flaws stand out as so many joggers in the past have but these are not that way at all they are so comfy and just right they could easily be dressed up or down these joggers could quickly replace your everyday jeans or black leggings habit to add a new more stylish twist
this dress caught my eye in the store its lovely i dont think i wouldve ordered it its hard to see the charm in the photo but i tried it on because the colors are so pretty and the fabric has vintage lookfeel and i couldnt pass it up on sale i usually wear a  but i bought an  because the saleswoman said the sleeves run small and there isnt any stretch in the fabric both are true i tried on both dresses in that size because of color placement and to check on the sleeve size b
i saw the two star review and wanted to share my opinion i saw this item that had been returned to a store and i love it the fabric is a bit sheer and i think will require a nude tank underneath but i think its adorable dont be scared away by the review below

"this sweater is actually so cute on i had no idea nut decided to try it on since it was on sale what a msitake i had to actually buy itthe grey part is very soft and warm the design part is nice andflattering nothing wrong with this sweeaternote i am petite  foot  inches and decided to buy the regular size for longer length"
i love the versatility of this top i feel like i can wear it with anything to dress it up or down
i found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it

i love this dress although the darting is terrible the colors are much richer in person its a beautiful dress for events and has a nice weight so it doesnt feel too flimsy since it is not lined i really love the length of the sleeves and the swish of the skirt however the darting makes your bust have two little triangles i really wish i could reseam the darting as its a bit strange looking
this is a beautiful top i purchased this in the greenmoss color its reminds me of a vintage looking bluegreen it fits generously has more of a swing style to it i love it i think it is romantic and feminine glad i made the purchase simply beautiful
love the asymmetrical hem waist fit snugly as in perfectly it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well a little stiff in the fabric classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didnt feel like we could wear it all year round  cant petite or  was great  lbs
this dress is very pretty in person it fits true to size and is very figure flattering one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage my only gripe with this dress is that its a little rough and stiff feeling i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft it probably works for most people but not for me so had to go back
great pants i love the style and fit would highly recommend
"first i absolutely love cloth  stone but lately im finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesnt fit my style thats ok because they still have some good basics what i mean is the cut a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front ie their slip dress they have out right now this particular tank is like that although this one is borderline the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i cant help but think im wearin"
the top fits nice but after one wear didnt even washed it the fabric was all fuzzy would not recommend it
beautiful fit and true to size highly recommend they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on
beautiful fit and true to size highly recommend they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on
i agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such this really does have a lot going on i usually wear a  in skirts and based on reviews went up one size it still saw way up near my chest  i think even an  would be too small its sooooo tiny at the waist probably buy  sizes  and  sizes up from your own also the skirt flares super wide at the sides it doesnt sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand its like a skirt
color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine now for the cons  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacockunder my arm which could be seen i guess if i waved the rest were parts of the bird i would love to have the one in the photos  next who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea  if i had gotten a nice patterned top i would have replaced the buttons blouses that i like never seem to b
these pants fit great i ordered my normal medium and they fit perfectly i was worried that they may look too much like pajamas and lot look right with my stomach but no issues there i think i will get a lot of use out of these
i saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away it is a vest so its not meant to be fitted so i think sizing down is fine im usually an xss in tops i went with the xs in this and j still get that relaxed look which is nice this vest is great very versatile simple yet adds great style it was a bit of a splurge for me but im happy i added it to my closet
wore it to an interview the color is fantastic its beautiful and artsy highly recommend
but the back of it by the waist bunches just a tiny bit if i get bigger it will be too long but i love the skirt it is flattering and cute not itchy for me even if the title says wool i ordered the  and the length is pretty much as pictured just below the knee in front the waist is snug bigger it would fall more on my hips hence the too long comment earlier  lbs  in waist short legs
"i ordered these in the neutral and the fabric and construction are everything i hoped they would be they are a lovely light weight rayon that i think will be very comfortable in hot weather the printed fabric is really prettysadly they seem to run on the large size i wear size  pants but the xl was too baggy in the legs and a little too large in the waist i am sending them back and getting the smaller size"
love this blouse the color is really unique and love the back button detail i dont think the white buttons look cheap at all as another person pointed out  they add a lot to an already beautiful top cant wait to wear it

"purchased these in both colors today great sale pricehei hei is my favorite brand of pants especially their pull on printsi am always a medium these ran slightly large in the waist and stomach i tried on a few mediums and luckily found the smallest in eachthe beige motif is beautiful and can really be dressed up the material is soft the color scheme is gorgeous they have a lovely silky feel to them i always wear an over top so the little bit largeness wont bother me being on"
bought these today at the denver store nice peeps at cc anyway i feel in love the style is simple free and easy for summer and the neutral color is lovely in person so glad i bought thesenow i have something to wear to work tomorrow 
when this piece arrived i was surprised at how weightless it was there are  layers to it an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all to take it home i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out super stubborn but i am pleased with the look of the garment usually i like the look of a dress that
i do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute but wasnt sure about the fabric hte coloring is fun too i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding
this dress is absolutely beautiful the grey is more vibrant in real life than the picture suggests and the maroon red is perfect for fall and winter seriously this is not your typical sweater dress the sheer sleeves elevate it to a whole other level it comes to just above the knee on my  frame it is a bit looser on top im  and more formfitting around the hips but not tight or clingy and so comfortable i am  lbs and took my usual small so i think it runs true to size the sl
the peachy color read as pretty gold on me which i think was good for my pale skin and sandy hair the lavender accent color is also very nice forgiving fit elegant fabric pretty print respectable hemline super flattering neckline love the pockets all in all i think this dress is a nice choice for day events

this dress is a work of art both online and in person the color is more vibrant in person and both colors are beautiful i like the mango color better because it looks better on my olive skin tone plus i like the purple flowers against the orange background thank goodness for the liner because this dress is very thin it wrinkles easily but i think it comes with the territory due to the thin silk fabric for short gals like me a belt is a must for a structured look if worn with heels otherw
i ordered size small i am    b the fabric is super soft and the fit is great theres an adorable little quote on the panties lining and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining the feel of the lace and fabric is divine love it one more thing to notethere is very little lining in the bra really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric it is enough to protect modesty but not much else
this dress is definitely light weight and it requires a slip or you could wear a black tank and tights with boots there wasnt a security tag in mine so no holes when i bought in store i even accidentally caught it on a costume bracelet and it did not rip or damage although you probably wouldnt want to sit on concrete or rub against something rough i would recommend this dress its gorgeous on for the price i think it should come with a slip fyi the back half of the waist has elastic

loved the idea of this  unfortunately it disappointed all around its way too short and ran small the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece usually an retailer small   lbs  but ordered a medium small would not have fit in this piece do not recommend

i really wanted to love this dress the cut out design is beautiful and it is very feminine however it does not really cut in at the waist and it left me feeling a bit boxy i think if it cinched at the waist it would be perfect it didnt work out for me but i think on the right girl it would be very cute

i ordered this on a whim not sure what to expect im petite   and ordered a small petite i usually wear xss in anthto tops but wanted a little extra room for layering in the cooler months ahead do i opted for the small petite instead of xs it fits beautifully and is very cozy too the collar is gorgeous and very soft i think this is a beautiful and unique piece for any fall wardrobe
got this dress for a party  it was a last minute purchase and i was nervous if it would fit  it not only fit it looks great and is very comfortable  have to love an aline skirt and a top with short sleeves  it covers everything while looking sexy  and i didnt have to spend a second worrying if something was showing that shouldnt be  got compliments all night  i got it in red and black but went with the red based on feedback from husband and bff  buy it now  its perfect for holiday p
"the shirt was better than it actually looked online the only downfall was that there was a pulled thread on the shirt when i received it its something i can probably fix just a little disappointed receiving in that shapei would recommend this top very flattering and dressy if you want it to be"

i love this dress id get it in both colors if i could the cut and fit is beautiful id suggest sizing down if you feel like its too boxy or lacks shape the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl   thing to look for in a dress   and its just overall a classic pretty dress my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and im afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and isnt incredibly delicate like

more of a blouse than a tee because of the fabric which has a linen feel to it on the front the back of the top is more of a tee shirt material not a travel top as it would wrinkle the pattern and colors are the same as pictured the sizing is large  i ordered an xs my size is usually a small it is a generous fit and boxy not shaped at all the back has a horizontal stitch band about half way down which provides a loose blouson effectthe back which is all black and is tee shirt fabric
i bought this dress with a specific occasion in mind i could not turn it down because it fit like a glove i love the cut and the length
i didnt mind the scratchiness others proclaimed this garment had but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back looks great from the front but uncomfortable
i bought both colors the navy is beautiful but the grey is closer to a drab beige and the color really disappointed me ill be returning that one i love love the fit and feel of the sweater it drapes wonderfully whether open or closed and its so soft however the fabric pilled significantly big pills not even little ones where my arms touch my sides after just four wears  i get that rayon is finicky but that is ridiculous the navy is now out of stock in my size so i guess ill try t
the bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious order one size up this line runs small i read the reviews and ordered a medium i am normally xss in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out trust me youll want another pair after trying these on
i ordered this and there is just so much fabric in the pictures i think it is pinned in the back in the main photo to make it look more streamlined definitely a miss
i always search each summer for a maxi dress and this is the winner this summed i love the way it wraps fits perfectly i got a size medium and i am   the dress is long enough to wear with flats or heels i recommend this
i was really hoping this dress would work out as it looks like it could be a staple outfit for work the material is very nice but unfortunately the dress was way too big there is a band right under the chest that i would think should be somewhat fitted to give the dress some shape to your figure but it was wayyy to big on me especially considering i am largechested i will be returning this
i found this dress delightful i have worn it numerous times and though quite long for some girls fits me well my only complaint is that if the wind blows it tends to fly open as there is only on clasp at the breast the fabric is light and comfortable i wore it in costa rica and it felt refreshing i am   lbs and a  cup i would suggest a larger size for girls as the small fit me very well
first i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to mens tie  it is a thick weight silky feel  next i was surprised by the cut i wear a  petite and the waist of the large is at least a size  if not smaller  finally the length was really long  i realize i am  and buying nonpetite sizes but the cut was high ankle on me i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric both are unusual and good for fallwinter  but i did not like the rest
this dress just feels and looks amazing i love how it isnt too short like a lot of new styles i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter i also love the plaid cuff detail the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced i got home and realized one button was missing i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms  buttons popped off
i ordered this online with out trying it on the store it does hang a teeny bit loser than in the photo of the model but in my opinion doesnt look bad plus im not a model what i did was put a thick belt on and it just brought the dress to a new level love it with a belt i am an art teacher and it was perfect for work and then going out after with friends the school is not secular so the skirt must be long enough it hit right above my knees in the front as well as the sleeves i ag
what a perfect summer dress after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and its perfect the slip is a little snug on the hips but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger i cant wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer
this was my first time to purchase and wear a tunic and i was very hesitant about the look but i love this design it is beautiful and seems to be very well made i agree with a previous reviewer that the slit is high it comes to my waist but i dont think it is a problem i always appreciate this in other reviews so hopefully it helps im   lbs and a small  the xs works well for me
retailer is known for their unique designs and this one does not fail to disappoint i usually wait for items to go on sale but knew i had to have this one in my collection due to the fact that it can easily be worn with a pair of pants the actual shirt is a bit shimmery which you cant tell by looking at the photo i didnt mind it and thought it was actually a plus i just think it is a bit too expensive because although it is nice quality i dont feel it is worth the price tag pretty

while this top has a lovely design neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads
i am a collector of clothes and textiles that is a passion this blouse meets all the criteria of something treasured from times past the roses are almost charles rennie macintosh i am so happy to own this blouse it fits perfectly and makes me feel beautiful stylish in my own style
"first let me start out by giving a reference i am      i usually take a size  in maeve esp if there is no give i bought a regular size  first the good the design it is classy it will keep boobies the ones of the larger side in place this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress it is slimming and i have hips the bad surprisingly the fabric gets dirty super easy i have no idea why everything clings to it i got my dress f"
i picked this dress up off the rack on a whim and did not expect to love it i was so delightfully surprised this dress is made of a lovely thick starchy cottoni found i didnt require a bra which is great because the back is a gorgeous feature of the dress the white band across the midsection makes the waist appear small the dress has sort of a retro feel with the tea length and looks best with heels i did note a little bit of gaping under my arms but not enough to keep me from buying
matronly and unflattering i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type
"the designpattern balances broader shouldersnarrower hips and gives my straighter waist definitionat  size  ended midknee but overall felt a little too long torso length i normally take  or  in retailer dressesi like the feel of the fabric and the overall playful yet chic look"
very chic version of a turtlenecktunic material more substantial than i expected ultimately it wasnt really flattering on my body type but otherwise i would absolutely recommend
i have never written a review on retailer before but after seeing this top in the store and then seeing how it is depicted online i felt i had a duty to review it it is gorgeous i saw it in the store and tried it on with my mom and we both had a fit over it the fabric is light pink with a shimmer the flower detailing is so feminine and soft the backs closure is just another piece of the beautiful detailing i left the store and thought i would think about it only because i was trying to be
this is a very cute tunic but it is slit so high on the sides i really like the fit but i think im going to return it because it is slit so high
i absolutely adore this dress i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size  but the  was still available so i snagged it im glad because the dress runs small and the size  would have been snug around the waist the style is perfect and the dress is well made the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly i dont think its too white like some reviewers have stated you cant wear a bra with this dress but t
i absolutely love these pants i was really hesitant to try these on for fear they would look like a diaper ive always liked the look of these pants but didnt think i had the body type to pull them off being  with some curves i tried them in my local retailer in the solid grey in both a medium and small i could have gone either way but the medium fit better in the he hips the draping isnt as exaggerated or bulky as it looks in the pic either so it didnt add weight to my frame the mate

i got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit feel and overall look at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits  attractive sturdy and very comfortable to wear even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up weddings parties etc
yay i found it my goto dress for this summer its perfect for casual daytoday stuff as well as summer festivals nights out travel etc i love the design length and fit its a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size the laceup front gives it a sexy corsettype bodice but in a very casual appropriate way i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages its flattering for us curvier ladies
i love this dress i got it in the blue and i feel like everything about it is so modern and class and summery it runs a bit on the small side im between a  and an   i went with the six but its definitely tight i have a larger chest and its pretty low and sexy though you could knot the laces at the top for a more modest neckline ive also put shirts under it and its a super cute jumper im  and the dress regular not petite hits right below my knee
i saw this dress online and loved it i ordered the blue denim one in my usual sizes an  and  but i think the  was sized wrong anyhow both were too small so when i returned them they were in the store i ended up with a size  which fits great with a little bit of room it is light weight simple but fun and very comfortable to wear i have received many compliments on it on my first day wearing it i also ordered it in white thinking that i might prefer that color but when it arri
i am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it i cant imagine how they got it to fit this model so well i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue unfortunately i had the same problem i am a c cup size perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust i ordered t
this is a stunning blouse you cant tell from the photo but it looks very  i am so happy with this blouse it is gorgeous im an xl and purchased this blouse in xl and it fits wonderfully it fits nice and flowy and i feel i dont need a cam underneath i highly recommend it

dont be put off by the sparkle this jacket is amazing lovely detail with the print on print with the sequined patches i love this retailer in house brand elevenses i take a medium in this brand  and the medium fits full with room like a bomber style would offer i had tried a small in my local store and it was not a small small so if you want a tighter fit then go for a small but i like thinks to have a more fluid feel i have a  dd chest as reference i plan to wear this in spring
a couple of months ago i bought the white in this top in my usual size small its cute  flowy  like to wear it with ankle or capri leggings have worn with shorts as well casual  cute plus i love cotton anyways   think ill go ahead with the other colors since the heat will be arriving soon
"this top is beautiful i would say the pink stands out more in the print in person than in the picture and its gorgeous the adjustable strap is nice there is just enough padding in this swimsuit to feel protected without being bulky or worrying about it moving around in the top this is seriously my new favorite could not recommend enoughfor reference i am a  and purchased a small"

i tried this top on with a pair of white shorts half tucked and it looked really classy and nice the fit was loose but flattering it is a tiny bit sheer but i was wearing a magenta bra so perhaps i am biased overall i think this is a good basic addition to a summer wardrobe can be worn with a nice skirt or with jeans as shown here the  or xs cant remember fit me at  lbs with  chest
"i purchased this gaucho as a gift for my motherat first i was about to try it for myself because gaucho is a little trend nowadaysbut later it turned out that it was a perfect fit for my motherit went well with her perhaps because she saved a lot of her fashion from it also fit well with contemporary fashion as wellhowever i think it matches better with vintage fashion than to contemporary fashionso if you happen to save those good old fashion take them out and try"
when this dress first showed up online i liked it but didnt buy it because i wasnt in love retailer weekend popped up so i decided to take advantage of the  off and ordered this dress it shipped to me in no time the dress is beautiful the fabric is soft and airy this is the first off the shoulder dress that actually stays off the shoulder no riding up no fussing i suggest sizing down because this dress is slightly flowy
this is such a cute top ive learned to size down in swing tops or else they look way too big  in a sloppy way i ordered the xxs  and  and it fits well itll look cute with my black skinny dress pants or jeans i definitely recommend
im curvy and i often have trouble finding pants that dont have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs these fit awesome especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller they do emphasize my hips so if youre trying to hide hips these arent for you i love them thoughthey drape beautifully and feel great
i feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers  got compliments at work   they are definitely more of a work pant due to the material  i think i could wear them outside of work lookwise but maybe wouldnt feel as comfortable in them after the hours of ninetofive due to the material

im so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores i didnt really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person i got the navy blue in size  which fit tts i got a regular size vs the petite size which i usually like to go with because im short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the models length shown online they seem so versatile im looking forward to wearing these
im keeping these shorts because they are cute i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great but they are snug around the legs i think i would have preferred a more baggy look but then they would have been too big around the waist had i ordered my typical size they are soft and comfortable the navy color is really pretty
i love these shorts i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt they are so comfortable and the length is perfect i love that they are loose around the thigh so they dont ride up while walking i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide i wish they had black army green and a dark wine i would be in heaven i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy
"this dress set my heart aflutter but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing i literally ordered six different sizes and when i put them on they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist then it would look like the model does i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the modelso i played around with it and ended up putting in  small darts in the front and v"
i wear a typical  in coh jeans and i ordered these in a  they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans the wash isnt as faded out as in the picture and at  the rip is right at my kneecap i bought these for the distressed wash and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans
i love these shorts would buy them in every color the colors are all fabulous and the fit is great too not too short not too tight very soft comfy feel
i love the way these shorts fit and look very comfy but after laundering one time the lavender color became blotchy used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas  they are unwearable i have several colors but the only color that was a problem is the lavender  for one wear was a waste i hate to leave negative feedback but be careful with laundering
"i ordered this dress to wear for summer weddings this year i am both surprised and excited that it fitsi normally wear an  sometimes a  stores like retailer are a place i go to admire fun cloths but not to actually shop i was concerned that the xl was going to be a fake xl this happens sometimes a brand only makes clothing up to a  so theyre xl is really a  but not so i feel like the xl could fit a    the l would probably fit a  as wellthis dress fits in"
great shorts ive been buying these for the past few years each year i add to my collection with new colors i have  pairs now perfect length and can be rolled if needed to show some more leg
i have been eyeing this top online and initially thought it was very fitted and structured as it appears on the model upon trying it on at the store i agree with other reviewers it is a tad boxy i ended up sizing down to a small and it fits nicely    usually i take a medium or  in retailer tops i can see where this might not work for everyone but i found it to be a fun take on a classic tweedy look i plan to add a pop of color with jewelry or even pair it with the pin
the quality of this top is quite high it feels like silk the print is lovely showy without being too over the top i love it and would highly recommend it
i purchased two pair navy and sky for a trip to the caribbean and im so glad i tried them on in the store these are the nicest fitting and most comfortable shorts i own by far would highly recommend well made too
i like this top i received a ton of compliments when i wore it to work but the material doesnt feel as highquality as i had expected from the pictures online it wasnt worth it to me to send it back but i doubt i would have bought it if i had tried it on first
i absolutely adore these shorts and pick a few colors every year like last year these do run big so do size down the length is perfect to roll them as much as you like they look great after washing and wish they came in more brighter colors love these and highly recommend these
just like the afterward lace cardigan i love this so much ive had the black and white for about  years now and they are still intact only the buttons fall off once in a while but thats when im being aggressive and on the go buttoning the cardigans from this year just add to my knitted and knotted collection
i bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since i love that you can wear it either on or offtheshoulder the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy comfortable and easy to wear on the shoulder ive even worn it to work on casual friday the print is versatile and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey i definitely recommend especially since i notice it is now on sale it is generously sized so id recommend erring

the print of this skirt is so fun i love how its styled on the model and i could see it being very versatile i decided not to keep it because mainly it is pricey and im afraid itll get easily damaged if i would wear it i think id be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning the fabrics nice and good quality but honestly if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a
this top caught my eye right away and i had to have it i am obsessed with everything off the shoulder and this is a great transition piece to wear that off the shoulder look well into fall i was expecting the fabric to be a little lighter and i didt realize there would be a ribbed texture to the fabric the shirt is also very long and i feel as though it runs large that being said it looks super cute on and i intend to style it just as shown in these pictures with zipper accented skinny jean
cute offtheshoulder top with a dark floral motif totally on trend for fall as previous reviews mentioned material is ribbed which makes it look a bit like corduroy but it is not thick so it just makes it seem more appropriate for colder weather i think it will be great with skinny jeans and a choker
love this cardigan the quality is beautiful and and comfortable i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch
love this cardigan the quality is beautiful and and comfortable i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch
i didnt plan to wear this off shoulder sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder the fabric is nice i liked the vintage looking design thats black with purple flowers the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder dont think i will though
i love cloth  stone clothes and have this version in a long sleeved shirt it is a little boxy but the weight of the fabric helps with hang of it i love the feel of the fabric and the weight of it for a summer dress yet it is too sheer for a summer dress it needs a liner or little cami dress to wear under it to keep it from being see through however for a texas summer that defeats the point of a loose easy dress to throw on i sadly sent mine back
i loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little ummmmm no its weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay im only a  weigh  pounds  and it made me look huge and awkward this is going back
saw this in the store and immediately liked it when i tried it on i loved it colors are muted and the style is very flattering the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south length is perfect for me  it does look great off the shoulders but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more workappropriate look it does run slightly large i wear a large but went with a medium in this one so it wouldnt be to
i bought this dress to wear for our upcoming family pictures i  think the image does the dress justice  the fit is so flattering and slimming i feel like it can easily be dressed down too with a cute jacket in either denim or leather the material is thinner and it does wrinkle a bit the price tag is a tad high also for a thin maxi dress but i just had to have it

this vest is a stunner the dark brown suede is so beautiful the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest its hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch yes it is a little pricey but its an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too its a keeper
"i was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different but these werent issues for me the color is navy it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress which i think is nice no one likes a limp bow  the belt is nothing to write home about but it ties the dress together nicelythe front pocket is different but i really like it i had a hard time conceptualizing it before"
i found this today on the one and only rack i absolutely fell in love with it i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly other customers were asking where they could find it in the store i highly recommend it can be dressed up or down
i thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style but i returned it immediately it runs so large the colors are faded and the trim of the shirt curl over so it looks cheap and frumpy i do not recommend this it hits in all the wrong places
this blouse is pretty and drapes wonderfully i dont think its too wide at all its soft and comfortable its stretchy yet with quality fabric that should keep its shape definitely a classic piece the sale price makes the cost more appropriate the white is a little transparent but with a tank its not a problem the black is beautiful im having a hard time choosing between them i love the cut and sleeve details it wouldnt have looked right with less fabric its needed for the sty
this is a modern version of the peplum top and very flattering if you dont mind flowy cuts the material has a nice heaviness to it and i love the black pebbled effect  d  lbs fit small perfectly
this is a super cute style and i love it with white skinnies i purchased the gray colorway i am normally a small in tops but purchased the xs based on other reviews the xs is still pretty loose on me but i dont mind too much because i like flowy tops anyway the color is so pretty and the design is edgy it will transition to fall well
this is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person  a nice mix of modern and artistic with just enough color and a flattering fit my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day especially at the neckline if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin i would recommend it for style and fit
i got the black in a medium it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy i think its the angled wide sides on me the design just created bulk nice substantial fabric but it isnt soft or cozy back it goes
this is a beautiful skirt it is exactly as pictured the colors are bright and vibrant and the skirt is very full as expected i feel like it does run a bit small im usually an  in skirts and dresses and bought a  it was a bit snug at the waist but not too tight so i decided to keep it for now my one complaint is the horrible noise that the skirt makes with my every movement anyone and everyone can hear you coming from a mile away the skirt is beautiful but a little stiff as well i do
if you are looking for the perfect tshirt to add a little flare to your basics this is the one for you it is so comfy and baggy yet still looking like you pulled yourself together i am just waiting for more colors to come out i basically live in the green and white versions of this shirt
one of the best retailer pieces i have ever purchased  high quality and fits true to size  i have a large chest and this minimizes and creates a really nice silhouette  i highly recommend got so many compliments i bought both colors
i am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit if youre a true xs id skip this one however if you are able to size down i think it would look really great
i love this tshirt i feel classy stylish and comfortable wearing it as other reviewers have noted it is bellowy in the peplum but that is the design and i love it it looks great with skinny jeans and can be dressed up or casual another terrific purchase from retailer
great sweater vest its not too thin or too thick just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition its easy to put on and i dont worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler highly recommend i am a  and usually wear a
i was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package it was a wrinkled messlighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love it draped beautiful the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled i feel iike i will use for many seasons
these are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesnt cling i ordered my normal size large so id say theyre true to size the leg isnt too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am im short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown think theyd look best with shorter tops i decided to return but still highly recommend

i love vests and this is a great one warm and cute because it is sweater material some of the threads look like than can pull but i still think its stylish and different and still a classic to have
just the perfect weight for summer wear falls gently over tummy without being too long and the ruffled edge and quirky uneven length make it just interesting enough to make it feel like more than just a tee shirt i got it in black and reordered in pale blue and am hoping the lighter color is not seethrough this is a nice buy on sale and can be dressed up or casual it feels and wears great but i have not washed it so gave it a good on quality if it washes well then an excellent would be
the ruffle is a sweet detail on what might be an otherwise basic rather boxy shirt it is a nice weight and drape but please know it is a bit short and square i love the asymmetrical ruffle however and think it makes this tee worth it
i tried on a size  in the store just for fun i am a  petite and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up the  was actually fine yes it is a little hard to zip up but once on it is totally fine not even too snug but i didnt sit and eat we shall see i dont plan on ordering the size up i think the zipper needed some wiggling
bring back the old retailer timeless pieces this cardigan is very flattering the flutter sleeves add a romantic touch to the cardigan the colors are neutral and the vine part black is like velvety the fit is super flattering i originally bought hte xs in the store but decided to also order the xs petite to compare  i am  lbs  and  dd with  waist both fit but the petite was better fitted on my waist also the length would work better on top of dresses i also tried
"as others mentioned love the little buttons and the cut is flattering i ordered the denim one multicolor i didnt end up keeping it but will order again if goes to sale likes colors are fun material is soft buttons are beautiful cut is decently flattering what i didnt love is it looks wrinkledi ordered the xxs and xsp  only tried on xxs as i didnt think i would keep it anyway but thinking of it is should have still tried the xsp arms were almost snug on me i lift weight"
the idea of this shirt is awesome it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy the ruffle is darling i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications i think a lot of people would buy it then

i think this top works best for a petite person i am  and  lbs the xs is perfect for me i love it so much i purchased it in more colors i machine washed and line dried it washed beautifully
i read the mixed reviews on this tee but i think the fit is flattering and comfortable i sized down as i do in many retailer tops and it is fitted in the shoulder and chest and then widens away at the waist the length hits me at the hipi have worn it layered with a longer tank underneath
i bought this in the sky color and sized down from my normal medium and absolutely love it i dont think its boxy at all on the contrary i love the way it hangs i dont find it to be short either though i do tend to layer with a longer cami underneath ps the ruffle detail is precious
beautifully made designer sweater and its soft and comfortable i decided to return because its just too much for my body  the fringe which is quite long overwhelmed my shape and i looked much larger than i am the color is true white the knit itself is fuzzy it closes with a single button on the placket at the neckline although not for me i do recommend
"i absolutely love these tees i have them in almost every color  i find i can wear them with almost anything can dress them up or downi feel like they are true to size i purchased the small but i probably could have worn an xs too  i wanted a looser fitalso they wash and dry well toofor reference   "
"this dress did not disappoint it fits great im  and weigh  and i got a petite xs length was perfect i have a longer torso so the waist was a bit higher than mine but it didnt sit strangely and hung well i am small chested and the top fit me very well i think if you have been blessed in that area you may want to size up overall it really is beautiful the pattern and the unexpected transition from one pattern to the next is just what i hoped for and why i buy from retailer i"
this is a darling little sweater it is well made and the fit is true to size however its just not long enough on me to be a top which is what i was hoping for  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of  style but its way to short on me for that even with my highest waisted pants and skirts it shows skin  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos  im still
this is a great shirt to wear with jeans or pants i love the tucks in front with brass buttons you dont have to unbutton all of them as the shirt slides easily over your head i love the pattern and it is a great look for fall and later on winter  i think this will be my goto shirt this season
"this skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures fit is true to size perfect drape lined  not clingy just perfect in every way its at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell outgrab it now in your size while you can only con i can think of is that it might be a bit long for petite sizes but maybe they make it in petite"

i bought this shirt in a l since i didnt want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be it is so boxy its like a completely different shirt i have no idea how it looks good on anyone unless it is simply widened the larger the size maybe a m wouldnt be as wide and therefore as boxy but this shirt is just a bad mess returning
i have a couple of these tanks so i thought i would try the tshirt and its even more flattering than the tanks which i also love great material doesnt stretch out like you would think it would and looks great with shorts or pants
this is a lovely blouse i think is a bit roomy but even so i like the look i have to dress business casual for work and this blouse fits the bill as its not too casual
"i was going to order this coat online but i ended up finding it in store there wasnt a  petite available but the store had a  reg and i found it to fit well enough im about  lbs with a  ft frame and a  chest i was able to button up with a sweater underneaththis is a fabric coat though i think it could have been great as a wool coat the design and the colors make it easy to dress up any simple or basic outfit i highly recommend"

i bought this very cute tshirt in sky wore it once then washed it according to the washing instuctions machine washabledryable this tshirt turned into a crop top i cant wear it its going to goodwill i would suggest that you air dry this shirt if you want to take the chance that it wont shrink up several inches
i got this shirt in light blue i absolutely love it i just bought it for the summer and i wore it on a day where it was  and it was just perfect it is a very light material and its very flowy so it breathes very well i got an xs i am  and it fits just perfectly highly recommend
gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut thats flattering feminine  fun  i sized up and ordered the the  to fit my large rounded rib cage    i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small  i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine  stats are     on top  on bottom
im a size  in retailer pretty much across the board  size  bottom  top generally go for the xs and i ordered this in a  based on other reviews its definitely not a winter coat which i understood its not for layering over a heavy sweater either i wish i had ordered the size  instead so that it was a little snugger in the waist as is i can wear it over a shirt dress or light sweater and thats fine but unlike other reviewers i dont think you need to size up if you want the
i knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on  comfortable beautiful fabric cute gold buttons  as well due to the cut it feels roomy but has a slender fit around the arms  the denim color has beautiful detail but i dont think i would like the maroon solid  i wish there was another nonsolid color  i would buy another one
runs almost two sizes small i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress  skirt  trousers like a suit the material is sturdy i recommend for early autumn or spring weather once again a collectors item with unique colors and design of pattern
this coat is just as nice as the russian one from a few years ago and fits the same it is stunning i swear life is way too short to wear only average coats if you are a parks and recreation fan think back to the treat yo self episodeand youll know what i mean i cant say enough wonderful things about this one
i bought this top in the store where i found they had a beautiful mint color not shown here i think the length is perfect so many of the tees etc are extra long so its nice to have a variety to chose from im  and this little tee hits right where my legs begin it is very free flowing and cool i own several similar tees and tanks from this line and they are great when the weather gets hot
as other reviewers said this top is rather boxy but i assumed it ran big ordered a size down  i love it i ended up buying it in both black  white personally i dont find it too short it hits on me just below the waist of my jeans  it covers up my tummy  which no one needs to see  but still looks youthful the little ruffle detail  front seam take it from boring basic to something special enough to feel put together by just pairing with cute jeans i generally wear a    bra
this is beautiful dress with great fit i agree with other reviewers that the top is small but works well for my small bust size the fabric is heavy giving the dress a more sophisticated feel
this was a rare fullprice purchase for me i do think that it runs slightly large but that is part of the look of this dress i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist but they didnt have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering but i also think it will transition well with tights boots and a cardigan when temps start cooling off

pictures dont do this dress justice color in store is much more vibrant embroidered flower is more orangecoral colored also at certain angles depending on the lighting this dress looks navy blue versus black which i enjoyed sizing  while i could have gotten away with my usual  the side view was too voluminous and somewhat unflattering so i ended up sizing down to a  for a more tailored look
i ordered a  and it fit great i am   and   in the chest i love the fabric i was drawn to it because i dont think it will wrinkle and crease as easily as other fabrics it is a flattering cut and is very beautiful in person the embroidery makes the dress unique
i love the idea of ruffles but this shirt was huge i normally wear a small or medium and i got the small it felt more like a large to me maybe if you size down  sizes it will work out for you im going to take it back rather than exchange i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer but its pretty thick
i like this top because it covers the bum  it is a little longer in the back than front  it is cotton modal soft and it is light enough for summer  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer but classier than a tank top  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility material for comfort and classical style
this dress has the same bold great color as the picture although it has a big swing to it because the upper portion is a bit fitted i dont feel like i look pregnant the material is extremely well done and i like the above the knee styling im very happy i bought it
this dress was adorable i found it to be a little too short for my taste im  and it hit mid thigh i think you would probably see my rear if there were the slightest breeze but it would be perfect on some shorter embroidery was beautiful and i loved the collar  also a little sheer but with nude colored under garments it wouldve been fine definitely try it out
is it possible to be in love with a dress i think so and i am when i put this dress on it literally took my breath away it is beautiful and very wellmade this dress is so fun i wore it to an event this past weekend and received more compliments than i ever have on something im wearing this beauty is so incredibly comfortable and bonus  it has pockets i am a petite  and it runs very true to size for me in the store it looked more navy than black but as i have it home it is definite
i was hoping this top would be a nice architectural piece to add to my wardrobe with its straight black line accents sadly in the end it is just a tshirt a large tshirt i ordered my normal size medium and this shirt ran more like a large i also did not like the way the neck was hemmed the fabric folds over itself when i think a better design would have been a more simple hem i ended up returning this item due to its size

i just bought this dress in the store and i absolutely love it except for one thing why are the sleeves on the actual dress so much shorter than the picture with the model i suspect the model has long arms not little trex arms so why does the sleeve hit at the top of her wrist while my lovely dress hits just past my elbow its a mystery was the pictured item not what the store took delivery of anyway still a great dress just trying to figure out if i should add lace or something to ma
let me start off by saying i never write reviews but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful onetime wear piece i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer and perfect fit im long torsoed and long armed and always have trouble with fit this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi

i loved the look of this online and ordered the xs as maeve seems to run large and that was the smallest size offered the length was good for me only  the elastic top fit well  but then from there it was too much fabric i thought this would be a straight fit or a slight aline but it was just a huge amount of fabric on meseveral inches on both sides big i think with the large ruffle along the top and the tremendous amount of fabric hanging down from the dress underneath the ruf
i saw this dress online and thought it might be an adorable eclectic piece to add to my closet and was i right the simple shape mixed with the bold pattern make this dress an awesome one to own its easy and fun and funky plus it has hidden pockets beware though this dress seems to run a bit small i would say if you switch in between sizes like me i can be a  or an  then possibly go with the larger size i do have a large bust as well i wear a  so it shows some clevage but the girls
this skirt has a beautiful flattering feminine fit the floral pattern is delicate and a little different and of course the layers are what make this piece a stunner i highly recommend it can see wearing this all year dressed up with jewels or down with boots and a casual sweater
love this length print and material have already worn  times and wears and washes well sleeves are short than pic shows but i dont mind
"this is a great shirt its super comfortable and fits nicely not too big and not too smallyou can wear it with leggings or dress it up with skinny jeans and bootsi bought the striped and black one i highly recommend it"
i am   petite frame i bought this dress in xxsp the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined good for fall maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days but perhaps a cooler summer day unfortunately this dress runs pretty large much too large for my petite frame so i had to return it i would recommend sizing down this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event
when the top arrived and i tried it on it was great the length was perfect even though i am curvy after one wash done according to the directions the top shrank in length considerably i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of qualityi do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use i will be returning this item
these are nice dusty rose pants they have a great textured design on them they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch i will say they are not soft like sweatpants definitely feel like a polyblend but the look makes up for it the material is a little on the thin side and they are not linedbut not seethrough either
i really like this top it is form fitting and i think true to size that i would normally wear i do not think the vneck is too low so that i would feel comfortable wearing this even to work i was surprised at how thick the fabric was but i am typically cold so i like this feature the crisscross design in the front and back of this garment is very flattering and i get a lot of compliments whenever i wear this piece

i love love love this cardigan i ordered it in plum regular small as they were out of petite small  my preferred size i was very impressed with the quality of the cardigan the details like the sheer fabric around the neckline are very delicate and beautiful the waist line sits exactly where it should i was worried it would sit too low as i am short and did not get this in petite sizing so maybe i should say this cardigan runs small i think i have found the perfect cardigan it goes wi
love this skirt its like a denim feel so there is good structure love the colors anything goes with it and i love pockets very comfortable day skirt for just around town
i couldnt agree more with that first review i would add that it does run largethe leg holes are big beautiful flower watercolor design as it shows in the picture soft fabric and thin elastic waist band no fake string tightener or buttons simple and romantic yet still a good sleep short to prance around the house in
this is such a nice little sweater to add to a dress or tank fits true to size and i love the tie and hook and eye closure quality
the colors are so pretty a pinkish brown and a light brown trim it is very soft and elegant looking great with jeans or leggings the tie is a little high in back but looks great highly recommend
this fabric feels a little bit like heaven i would totally wear this out and not just with my jammies its adorable and the fabric is so soft i think im in love im   lbs xxsmall was a perfect fit
first i must say that i bought this zip up hoodie because of the material and how incredibly soft and comfortable it was  absolutely worth the price however the sleeves were about  too long because i am a seamstress and this was an easy hem for me i went ahead and purchased it and hemmed up the sleeves but i was honestly shocked how long they were you would have to have very long arms for this to fit you without alterations if you dont mind rolling them up i suppose it might work as w
i wanted this top to work so bad unfortunately the way the bust of the top is designed it isnt flattering if you arent flat chested it squishes on side of your chest and leaves the other side alone im a b cup and had this problem so if you are a b or larger i dont recommend however if you are smaller busted this piece would be worth the purchase
on sale this is a great deal the structure and fit of it are perfect maybe runs a tad big but i liked that its supposed to be a snug fit and is without being too clingy i chose the berry color and love it the ribbed style of fabric wasnt as visible in the pic online but i dont mind it in the darker color can be worn with a bit of flair by unbuttoning the turtleneck or kept classic by not
ive only worn the sweater a handful of times but im already in love with how soft and comfortable it is its a bit on the baggier side but that doesnt stop it from looking great ive gotten complements on it every time ive worn it i would highly recommend it to people who dont like the typical scratchyitchy textiles
"looks nice andi did like the button detail on the collar colors are nove and the feel is soft i would probably have to get a petite smaller size"
"i ordered this shirt in each color and different sizes petite regular my size a size up and one downverdict i ended up in regular size not petite because i felt the petite was jsut that short and i could feel te cold breeze in the store i could have gone in the   and   is my usual size but ended up in a  only because it was less wide on me it is hwoevcer a tiny bit tighter around the back if i cross my arms forward really i dont do that move on a daily basis colr i"
"i love the coziness of this sweater i do think it is designed for a looser fit but i sized down for a closer fit the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it i gave it  stars instead of  because it does shed some but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i dont need to worry about itjust lovely really love the blue color especially"

"this is the  time ive purchased a dolan top and returned it bc it was dry clean only both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans running errands etc i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt it is made out of rayon and thats the problem i thinki purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color hangs nicely doesnt cling the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that  i just pushed them up as a turtleneck it was a bit l"
i didnt think it was that cute in the picture online but when i saw it in the store i was in love  i am typically a medium and this was true with this  i have a  chest and you can wear a strapless easily with it and it doesnt show i am going to wear it for a cocktail party but it would work with flip flops too  just love it so happy i went into the store and saw it
i bought this cardigan in both rose and nude and i absolutely love both the weight is perfect for spring and fall and i love the details in the back and the pockets i thought the rose would be hard to match for tops but i have a number of things that work with it it fits true to size in my opinion
i bought this cardigan to take on a trip to the middle east it turned out to be a great purchase the weight of the sweater is substantial enough to add warmth and not just style i am not a huge fan of lightweight sweaters as i tend to be chilly all the time i was concerned that the design of the back might accentuate my rounder backside however it drapes very nicely i am petite  with moderate curves i typically get the xxsp and this was perfect the neutral color is great with almost
these shorts are beautiful and the fabric is used is so soft i wore them to the beach and they were very comfortable for walking around in all day my only concern was that the shorts run large in my opinion they have a tie string which ended up working out but i was hoping it would fit more like the model i am   with a  waist and ordered an xs i usually wear petites but i have bought xs shorts in regular sizes and they have always fit i do still recommend these shorts as th

purchased this fun feminine top right before vacation and wanted to wear it every single day the peplum style isnt typically something i gravitate to but this peplum is the perfect length and i love the sheer  length sleeves i chose the ivory version of this top and it was adorable with jeans oxfords  a cute hat for how beautiful this top is i feel like the price tag is an absolute steal
great layering top love the color grey striped matches almost anything the sizing is perfect and the material is nice and think but not so chunky that it adds pounds to your frame interesting detail with the snap neck looks sporty and jeeps it from being just another basic turtleneck
i am  so at the tall end of petit  and this is the perfect length i havent really done midi dresses before because i feel make me look stout this is not the case it hits midcalf the fabric is very thick although for polyester i think its kind of pricey im going to keep it anyways it doesnt look or feel cheap and i think it will be good for travel because i dont think it wrinkles easily the ribbon hits in a very flattering place right above the waist i have a very athletic

i bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue both are lovely i would say that the size runs a bit large i bought size  and the bodice hangs away from my back arms fit well though loose fit hangs well the lace is nice and stiff the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained i dont think that will be how it reads though but fair warning
so soft that i bought in  colors i love wearing them it is comfortable yet tailored i highly recommend
retailer sleep pants are my favoritethe only sleep pants i will wear fit is perfect flowing shape and ultrasoft fabric feel like a little bit of luxury first thing i put on when i get home from work
this dress is so flattering on i was astounded often the waistline in the petite dress are very high even though im only  tall but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring would be great for work or church but unfortunately doesnt really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price i highly recommend

i got this sweater in the neutral color which is very versatile it is truly beautifully soft and the design is very pretty  i really like the different material of the arms and vneck the length is good too if you like longer sweaters as i do the downside it sheds so badly sweater is just everywhere after putting it on i dont think i could wear it out of the house for this reason another reviewer suggested taking a tape roller to it to make it wearable but i think that would take

i ordered the neutral one with the fine stripe it will layer nicely with neutral colored sweaters and blazers the fabric is soft the quality is good the neck is cool that you can wear it two ways overall it is a good top i think its a little clingy which highlights every flaw in the back especially i wouldnt size up i still think it fits tts

cool color great feel to this sweater nice with jeans skirts etc very cozy to wear i just want to keep grabbing it every morning
i love this top i ordered it in a large thinking it would be a tight rib but it is not so i reordered it in a small i am    chest the small fits perfectly and probably could have taken an xs it is stretchy but fits wonderfully i bought the black i love how the neck snaps and adds a little pizzazz to a simple black turtle neck im wearing it today with straight leg jeans and my leopard print ballet flats i feel like audrey hepburn i will not be dry cleaning it i will wash
"this ia a long boiled wool vest with some spandex in it it is very soft and cozy i went with the ml cause i preferred the longer length even though i also fit in the xss i have worn it many times and my favorite way to wear it is with skinny jeans tucked into cowboy boots paired with a black lace top and a cool necklace when i am hanging out at home in yoga pants and slippers i throw it on when i get coldits like a cozy hug i highly recommend"
"i love these jeans they really added something special to my wardrobesize i purchased my normal size in the store and was worried they wouldnt stretch out the sales clerk helping me order the larger size alerted me that these will stretch a full size as i wear them but i wanted to be sure so i ordered the larger size just in case i received the larger size and when i tried them on i could feel them stretching out right away and feeling too loose i kept my normal size and wore th"
totally love this shirt as a basic with fun details super soft great quality fabric and the cutouts add the perfect bit of interest can see this accessorizing well and looking good with jeans or skirts really happy with it fits loose but tts
perfect way to add warmth in transition weather
beautiful dress  the  printed material under the tulle however hung  inches lower than the tulle skirt i had to take it to the cleaners and have it hemmed to match the length of  tulle skirt because it looked awkward even after paying full price for the dress i didnt mind spending the extra money to have it hemmed because the dress is that beautiful
although i loved it i feel like its too hip for me love the material style just doesnt look right on me
i think these are amazing for anyone over say  the way these hung on me at  were very unflattering in the front they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them thats all i can say without being crass
i love these pants so much i have them in two colors they are super comfy light and actually really chic perfect cool girl pants i have got so many compliments my young students  love my ninja pants i got them on sale great great buy i highly recommend them
ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip
"i agree with the other reviewer the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea but bad in execution they look and feel odd when onthese fit tts and they are soft with decent stretch but the rise is much lower on me than other  rise jeans i have as a  yearold woman they seemed inappropriately lowhanging on meas an aside these will def color transfer  there is a whole lotta rinse on these and they have a strange chemical smell to them not sure if that will diss"

the skirt is lovely has beautiful colors  and the touch of lace takes it to that ultra feminine level its a lot of skirtyards of material and i like that it is fully lined but this creates a problem the source of the only negative thing i have to say about it the only criticism i have is with the waistbandits much too flimsy to stay up on the waist because of the weight of the skirt i had my seamstress add a heavier weight elastic band inside the one it has or the skirt would star
i was intrigued by this vest online but really wanted to try it on first before i purchased it stopped into my local retailer store today and was happy to see they had it in stock i am typically a  and purchased this in the ml this picture does not give the vest justice in terms of the way it falls which to me is what makes a vest a success or not also the colors are great i was wearing a cream sweater and black pants when i tried it on went great with those colors but i think it wi
i have to disagree with some previous reviews  i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart they look absolutely adorable with booties flats wedges heels anything and theyre extremely comfortable and flattering as most pilcros tend to be i got my usual size  and the rise and fit is great i think maybe they stretch out a bit ive only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose but overall great and a good price at least co

i actually love these jeans i feel they run true to size i actually love the button detailing at the bottom makes them unique and different from the other jeans in my closet i can wear them dressed up with heels or wear with sandals
this skirt is very pretty but i think it runs very large i am a size  xs in retailer my waist is  inches   pounds the skirt is touching the floor even if i wear high heels i will have to wear it up my waist the elastic band is weak not sure if it will hold the skirt it should be ok with a belt i still recommend it cause its so pretty

i was drawn to this top due to its unique detailing and soft casual cotton feel i wear a nude bra underneath with no problem im    and the small hits right at my hips so its not to short or too long i often wear an xs in tops and i didnt even try on the xs in this one because i felt the small fit just right with the cutout detailing ill hand wash this i hope it holds up
i love the look of peplum tops i think they are very forgiving and they do a fantastic job of hiding my residual baby weight while still allowing me to look like i have an amazing figure not washed out figure i have several peplum tops but most of them are made out of a thicker fabric and they dont have much movability i absolutely love this one because it is a more casual design and much more comfortable than i am used to while still keeping the integrity of the peplum design the fabri
i initially ordered a small but found it looked way more oversized then what it should look like even considering the style i was swimming in fabric i exchanged it for a petite small and it fit perfectly it goes so well with so many looks and it is going to last a long while in my rotation looks much better in person too my only reservation is that unlike the original one i received this one had many threads loose throughout which i clipped and think will be alright but i expected
"i love love this trench i bought the grey and it goes well with so many other pieces i can dress it up for work or wear it out for brunch on the weekend its a great layering piece for the san francisco weather im adjusting toit does run a little big but i dont mind because it gives enough room for layering im short at  but still stuck with a small a small petite probably would look great as wellhei hei consistently makes great jacketstrenches "
"love this top just received it todayit is a very artistic interpretation for a casual topthe blue is gorgeousthe unique style of the peplm and the details on the front set this apartruns a little shorter but i feel the length enhances its beauty and is appropriate for the overall designlove ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly"
this is such a gorgeous shade of indigo i was instantly attracted to it upon trying on i was surprised at how soft the fabric was definitely a cozy sweatshirt feel in disguise i love the peplum detailing and found the xs to be just right in length to my hip and everywhere else i cant wait for it to cool off here in new england so i can wear this beautiful top i anticipate many compliments on s lovely top
this dress is absolutely darling it is light as a feather and floats on the body the fabric looks almost handpainted and fits like a dream i disagree with the previous poster and i think it looks very rich super comfortable and i know ill get lots of wear out of it you can dress it up or dress it down love it
beautiful fabric with soft drape unfortunately the captain kangaroo pockets are awful unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people dont want added bulk very disappointing returned
this top is very cute very flattering and very unique love the highlow back also very comfy would recommend to anyone
the pattern and color of this top are beautiful when i saw the pattern i knew i had to have it the fit is a bit strange short which is fine for me as i am petite and boxy i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price its a good late summerearly fall piece
this is a very stylish and unique trench it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets but needed a small for this one i am    lbs but with a large chest i think its very flattering i have small hips but the large pockets do not make me look bigger it arrived very wrinkled but i just touched it up with an iron i think the color is more of a taupegray and will go with everything love it

i tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it the picture does not do it justice it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality fabric is very soft and light weight highly recommend
the concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame although i appreciate the design it did not work for me
"i love this top i got the blue the colors are deep and just beautifulim normally a large so i feel this top runs large i got the medium and it fits perfect it is long im  and it hits the bottom of my butt you wont be disappointed try this top"
i bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week but its cut way too large that i felt like a football player this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame also the cut is way too big i was swimming in this
i have mixed feelings about htis top it is a nice shape and comfortable fits triue t o size but hte fabric is thin adn sheer i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale the  fit me perfectly  lbs  chest
the shirt design is very nice but it fits very loose it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material
i love this blouse it is perfect for a curvy figure i think it runs true to size maybe size up if you have a larger chest i love how it is so feminine yet structured the fabric is lovely soft and structured all at once love the knot i tried it with the stevie ankle jean and couldnt leave the store without it it is pricey but sometimes its okay to pay  for a perfect fit
"i loved the mauve color i loved the idea of the heathered fabric and lace insets but the linen was rough and scratchy my regular size was boxy and a little too short size i ordered my normal size small for retailer brands im  tall approx  lbs   long torso fit i was swimming in size small the cut was boxy and unflattering on me very wide through the chest it kind of hung on me the length was a bit short for my liking if i were to size down i would b"
comfy gauzy tee that has lovely lace detailing the white is totally see through just fyi i dont think its the best quality but totally worth the sale price i got the m and its loose and flowy in a good way
"the fabric is so thin i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normalsized letter envelope the problem is not going to be that the garment is seethrough which it is  its the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky its cottoney and i suspect it will get stuck against the back of my shirtpants while im wearing it and not drape nicely i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properlyhowever im such a sucker for a pre"
ive been looking for a great white blouse for awhile and this is it the tie waist is especially flattering for hourglass figures but im sure it would add some curves to any body type the fabric is soft not crisp and drapes beautifully you definitely will be doing some ironing though its a bit sheer but i always wear nude bras and felt no need for a cami i did buy the regular rather than petite sizing and usually wear a  or  but had to size up to a  regular to avoid gaping in f
although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well i downsized two sizes and it still didnt hang well on my body i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it
i loved the print on both but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel i went ahead and ordered the cat one today the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit size down for myself m was perfect since im built larger and broader on top the top is a bit long covers my hips and some of my bottom its a mixed fabric design so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types

cute and perhaps a little too innocent for my age because the petite was too high and wide on me  fits great on my shoulderschest and the flare can be controlled with a layer and belt  i already have a few ivory lace dresses that look age appropriate first try  i dont think i have the right personality for this one  looks great on everyone else ive seen wearing it
"the label says  linen but its so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen its not a scratchy linen at all its a very very fine knit but the top is not sheer i do not think you need a cami under it i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown it has a slight drape but its not really baggy at all i bought the grey and it looks lighter online that it really is its a bit darker and has a silver essence also i liked this so much i just bought another one in mauve"
love the lattice inserts makes it feel like you have ventilation which is nice on a hot summer day i purchased this in grey and in xs i normally wear m for a looser fit s for a more fitted look so i was really surprised that an xs worked for me and was fitted i havent worn it since i washed it though decided to buy the white but in a small pretty but very see thru will need to wear a shirt underneath a little bummed because i liked the breeze one other comment this shirt is long wh

i wasnt sure about this top online in the picture it sort of looks like it juts out after the tie but the reviews said it was really soft and flattering on i wasnt sure exactly how the sizing translated numbers vs letters so i ventured into the store i am normally either an xxs or xs in most retailer tops i went with size  i think i would have been ok in the  but it might have gotten a bit snug in the shoulder area sizing down and with the front tie it can be cinched in to create
i like this tunic it is quite long and print in blue looks good with the butterflies it feels very hot though maybe better for winter the sleeves are linen i usually dont like linen much it feels scratchy this top works better in colder weather due to the sleeves and length of top more like a tunic i recommend it but am sending it back because i need something for summer
im a  curvy these pants fit well and are so comfortable i think everyone should own at least one pair
i ordered in this in the kelly green and loved it so much i wore it the very next day after it came in the mail the green color is gorgeous and easily complements so many other colors in my wardrobe the cardigan itself is super comfy and i love the full length longsleeves so many cardigans these days come with  length sleeves which are fine but sometimes you want a long sleeve the fit almost runs on the larger side but i think that a slightly looser look works well for this cardigan
these days i am more like a  after gaining some weight when i was in my local retailer the other day i happened upon this dress only in a smallpetite i tried it on and it actually fit me very well i am  foot  so i thought the petite might be too short or wouldnt work but surprisingly it fit my body type i think ill like wearing it best with a pair of wedges or heels like most other reviews im inclined to agree that the regular size has too much fabric going on and probably is s
in paper crown dresses i wear a small or size  so for this top i ordered a small it was huge on me for reference im   lbs  it is very wide towards the bottom and it flares out way more than in the picture the material is also a little stiff so it really sticks out even if i sized down to the xs i think the bottom would still look unflattering so im returning this
"i am   tall  lbs i bought the  in the honey color they fit perfectly there is some stretch and they are super soft which for some reason is totally why i buy clothes the length is good since they are capris also they did not have my size in store so they had them shipped for free to my home received them within  business daysi would very much recommend them for a casual fun look the honey color will look great with navy grey and white for summer"
"thank you retailer for creating this sweetly vintage and feminine sweatercoat the boiled wool is lovely and the embroidery makes me lightheaded just looking at it this is definitely a nod to retailers past and i love it to bits i usually wear a size s or xs but bought this in the xs the fit is flattering as can be i was so happy to find a fitted and timeless piece in the sea of boxy and trendy sweatersits true that this sweater isnt lined but to my mind it would be a crime"
this shirt is more beautiful in person it has a lovely hand feel soft and the blue is as shown but a bit more vibrant i bought it for my  year old niece she loved it she may have to return for a small but i do feel the size ran true to size it depends on how you want to wear it

gorgeous embroidering and feel  very soft for wool this is a lot lighter than more jackets but with good layering can be worn in the winter im  tall and  lbs curvy and hourglass this hugs my curves beautifully in a size small and gives me a feminine shape it runs up to my knees and the sleeves are a bit long which will be hemmed soon i wanted the petite but it was sold out honestly this is perfect minus the arms the quality is gorgeous  so soft and inviting to wear it runs la
absolutely adore this jacket im typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be so perfect and beautiful the embroidery is gorgeous i feel so feminine in this coat
i bought  pair of these in the store and ordered another color at the same time these chinos are great for my figure i like to think of myself as a diamond shape  large chest moderate waist large hips and small legs these pants fit so great i bought my regular size and dont have to take in the legs the fabric is nice with the additional stretch so we women who arent  or  any longer can still feel great and look good without being dumpy im not a teeny woman either

love the fabric on this so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath this will not be one of those the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesnt feel too delicate the back is a super soft jerseyfeel wonderful will go nicely with jeans  flats for me as a super bonus i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party  ill be so pretty
the perfect summer pants i will be ordering more colors and possibly a smaller size i think the slim fit would look just as good in a less slouchy size i bought a size  petite in the dark blue not navy and they fit perfect and the color is amazing very high quality feel very soft and comfy for reference im curvy   lbs usual size is a   but ive recently been losing weight so my sizing may be off the pants do stretch out like most pilcro chinos

these are so soft and cute and i could see myself wearing them a lot however my normal  was just too baggy and the few times i tried to wear them around the house they just bagged out and all i did was pull them up every  seconds i ordered the black mostly because i wasnt crazy about any of the other colors if there were any colors left in a  that i could see myself wearing i would re order them in a smaller size and see if they were any better for me i think if they fit you well a

this top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color i wasnt too sure id like the cut on the bottom but the neckline was so lovely i thought id try it out i went with a small which is my usual if not extra small and loved it as soon as i put it on the shape is very flattering even with my post baby figure i definitely think that its better in person than in the photos online and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater thats both classic and mode
this top does look as pictured the sleeves hit me the same and the size was true i just didnt like it it was shorter than i wanted in length and i just didnt feel like this top was worth the price so its going back i feel like i have had shirts with this texture and over time they just didnt wear as well so i was afraid with  kids it wouldnt be a good idea i paired it with a blazer and it looked great but on its on i dont know just not for me for reference i am

this is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time i am a  the small was tts and so flattering i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it it isnt lined and could definitely show figure flaws for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust waist and hip  it fits me like the model in the image the one down side is that it is pullover
i so badly wanted this top to work it looks so cute but as soon as i tried it on i knew it wasnt a keeper i didnt even need a mirror its not suited for those of us with a bust im a  and anything but a lanky modelesque frame i suggest sizing up if youre busty and want to give it a try it looked dowdy on me
its a beautiful top but not for bigger busts ordered an xl and the top part would not button i recommend for those with smaller busts
i purchased this top i thought of it as a sweater to wear for a chilly holiday in mn its super flattering and i think it would be on anyone my  year old daughter saw it on me and claimed at a christmas present so i just ordered another we have very different body types but the neckline made us both look very elegant and it is super comfortable i havent seen how it cleans yet we both got the lighter colored onelove
one of the sales women was wearing this today she looked amazing then i tried on i looked really great the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person it is comfy   cotton the unique hem adds punch able to dress up or down im a true size  small fits perfectly medium was very loose and oversized well constructed feels more like a   retail pullover highly recommend
i love this color blue when this item went on sale i had to grab it and im glad i did it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on on a cool summer night and also in the fall there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch feels comfortable on and looks adorable
i absolutely love this dress the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape its great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south but i can put tights with it when it gets colder the dress is thin but not sheer so theres no need for a liner im  weigh  and ordered this dress in a size  i think i might have been able to wear an  but the  fit so well that i kept it
"i think this top looks lovely however it does not fit my body shape i am an hourglass shape the shirt clung tightly to my chest and didnt drape nicely around my waisthips like on the model i think top could look great on someone who has a lean square or athletic buildalso this top definitely runs large according to the retailer size chart i should be between a small and a medium for my waist and hip measurements but this top was much too large overall in a small and still"

i love this dress purchased it in pink and then in the blue color its perfect for any occasion and is very comfortable i feel like it fits true to size and was not to revealing in the front however if i was to wear this to work it would need a cami underneath it is not lined as well love this dress buy it in every color
i love the idea but it is more of a over sweater than to wear by itself like model too bigbaggy
i purchased this dress for my  birthday and i am so glad that i did i saw it in my local retailer store and immediately had to try it on it is very flattering because i am  usually a size  or  in dresses and it fit perfect the material is light definitely suggest delicate cycle and hangdrying but it is nice because you can layer this dress with a vest or coat highly recommend this dress

this is a beautiful dress i bought the red color in petite and love it i know i will wear it a lot and the style is really easy to wear i feel amazing in it even tho my post baby body isnt what it was
lovely top well made and feels wonderful on attention petites  i highly suggest you go for petite sizing because the standard xs is ginormous and looked nothing like it does on the model pictured
i am   small chest and narrow shoulders the  fits me perfectly i love the fact that there is a hem if i decide to let it down just a little being over  and tall it is so disappointing to find a dress you love but is just a little too short the fabric is not too heavy for our moderate summers and i think i will wear this often
i was so sad not to love this dress it is beautiful but is so unflattering on there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking so it just made me look incredibly frumpy i dont really think a petite would have helped  the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang the dress sort of clumps i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem but i was super disappointed narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off it is a t
i love this coat it does run a bit large i am   pounds and usually wear a petite in most retailer clothes i ordered a small but wish that i would have ordered the xs the length of the jacket is fine but the arms are very long i think that i might have the arm length hemmed but it looks ok rolled up too
this shirt is wonderful i totally recommend it for everyone
as other reviewers have noted this is a pretty top i really love the design alas however it is too big for my frame for reference i am barely  and about  lbs i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp i am going to have to part with it sadly
although seemingly simple this hooded sweater top is actually versatile wear with jeans or leggings even a skirt wear over a cami tank or even sleeved top i do like the delicate nature of this piece and it does appear to be made well enough to be durable would recommend
these pants looked worn washed  old looking when i received them the quality is super thin cotton as if its been washed a million times  is about to fall apart the workmanship is terrible you can see loose stitching all over the top portion is too tight  looks terrible stretched out i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online
i read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that the color was off i thought they were pretty dead on i absolutely love this jacket but do agree that its more of a sweatercoat than a heavy coat youd wear in the winter but i live in california so this will be just perfect for our winter i was afraid it might be too classic and uptight looking but its so fun the bell sleeves add some extra flair the overall coat has some stretch to it as well making it
i love this dressi have it in black and am about to buy it in the blueim usually a  but i bought a size  it is light and flattering with the gathering above the waistdoes tend to crease a bit but its not too bad love the way it can be dressed up or down think boots or vans or sandles i will dress it up to go out but also throw it on to pick the kids up from school
i bought this dress in the blue print and love it the drape is lovely and its not too short i feel like it can be dressed up or down i plan to wear it to a wedding at the end of the month for reference my measurements are  chest  and height  and i ordered the small im usually a smallmedium but went with a small based on other reviews i have a short torso as well and i feel this dress fits perfectly not too small or too large as other reviewers stated there is no linin

this is a stunning flattering welldesigned and sized magnificent and yet wearable comfortable summer blouse i am a busty  size  and this lovely piece makes me look amazing i most highly recommend to any woman the  cotton body has a very soft feeling and a little bit of give i experienced no pulling at the chest or back which can happen for me the bottom  of the crochet v is backed by the body of the top so you may not need a cami the combination of leaf printcrochet
i liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear i am  and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big
this ia a great casual topthe design flaws mentioned in previous reviews are what gives it a trendier lookthe length is perfect but i needed to size down from a large to medium because the fit was a bit loose on the body and armwould like to add that while it is good quality its still somewhat overpriced for a t shirt material top lace accent
after eyeing this product online for awhile i was able to try it on in store im so glad i did because while this dress is lovely it is clearly not designed for my body type i have a small rib cage and a large bust  which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me additionally the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible the fabric was gorgeous and soft and the
this tank is very loose fitting which i can understand would make some think it runs large taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted i love the draped styling which i also think makes sense with the pattern its an easy top toojust throw on and go and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest

this is a great sweater great color and style i love that its a little retro can be worn with jeans and tights highly recommend it does run a little big but not by a lot
this dress is amazing based upon its rack appearance i never would have tried this dress on but the fabric was irresistibly soft so i gave it a try i was amazed to see it fit so well im very curvy     so normally a dress without structure doesnt work on me but this one somehow does the elastic waist hits right at the smallest part of my waist im very short waisted if that helps and flows from there beautifully i think the vcut at the chest area help reduce the appear
this shirt is so cute its so soft love the lace element on the arm definitely thinking of ordering the white the back for me is a lot longer then the pic shows but i think it looks good
i have worn this dress twice and it is amazing the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it i am   lbs and  d i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone definitely one of the best things ive ever bought from retailer

i got this dress in pxxs in the gray color i am   petite frame and it fits like a dream true to size the fabric is super soft and thick drapes well not too tight and u can wear a regular bra length is also perfect no shortening required which is rare for me  this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion can be casual or dressy depending on accessories great purchase  recommend
i was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans this is exactly what i was looking for the color is better than the pic to me the style is flattering the size is just right cant wait to wear it i strongly recommend it
i purchased this in gray and it is proving to be quite versatile it is softer than i expected and not heavy or bulky i also like that the side slits are a bit higher than i expected i have paired it with knit pants and with a maxi dress i think it will work pretty much any time i need an extra layer
just agreeing with all the good reviews  love the color feel fit and versatility  you can look sexy or modest depending on your underpinnings and accessories  drapes over and disguises my figure flaws  this is a three season dress for me and i look forward to having this in my rotation in the years to come  i bought regular hem instead of petite
im not one for writing reviews but i thought i would for this absolutely beautiful skirt i saw it instore before it became available online and knew i had to have it i dont like exposed zippers but in this case the gold zipper is a nice detail on the skirt im curvy with a very small waist so the fit was fine i would definitely recommend this product
this skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion totally worth the price its very very well made and fits perfectly i usually wear a size  but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist i size down to  so they fit properly i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove im  and the skirt comes to midcalf on me which is exactly what i was looking for love love love this skirt i totally recommend it

i bought the blazer in the grey motif color it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as picturedi bought a small after trying it on in store i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer the arms are very fitted in my opinion so if you have bigger arms it might feel too snug you dont really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side meaning one folds back higher than the other so it isnt a symmetrical look i actually lik

i thought id add a review because a lot of this landscapeprint tee was still available at my local durham nc store the week after xmas anyway its a little different in person than how it appeared online when it was still available the white cotton is definitely a cream or offwhite and the silkscreen is darker colors and much more metallic than shown the metallic is a subtle gold its definitely  sleeves which i like and it has a curved bottom hem the surprise to me was that it
so glad i bought this its beautiful and being on sale made it even better good quality and versatile highly recommend
"ok if i had a different body this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me although my husband couldnt tell that the pants were tugging on me thanks to the pattern it does camouflage it was uncomfortable so if you are built like me this isnt the jumpsuit for you this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters for reference i am  and  pounds th"

i popped into retailer the other day just to look around and saw this dress  the fabric stood out first then i saw the cut and style and fell in love they only had xs and s and im usually a m because of my chest  but it looked so voluminous i thought id try it on the s fit perfectly the bodice fit a bit more closely and the rest of the dress flowed beautifully beneath it the sleeves are quite large but its kind of a fun look and feel its got a very peasant princess feel to

a beautiful comfortable dress with its own unique style a must to add to your wardrobe
kind of silky but to a point where they almost look like pj pants i am not sure if i will keep but overall nice feel i tried on a xxs p as it was a return xs sold out so went with it stretchy enough to fit me  lbs
this is a great staple for laid back weekend wardrobe the inside of the pullover is soft like sweatshirt material and its comfortable enough to sleep in also cute enough to wear out with jeans i would definitely recommend this sweatshirt im typically a size  in retailer  i ordered this shirt in a size  and i love the fit
i love this dress i ordered a petite size and just love how it fits i would highly recommend this dress too cute
i ordered this dress and have sent it back i think it could be a flattering dress the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly i am very long waisted so this might just be a problem for me i ordered regular size 
"i received this as a gift and have seldom been so pleased with anything as another reviewer noted some retailer clothing looks darling and then falls apart not something acceptable at this price pointunlike her this was not one of those times ive worn this daily for weeks and feel like the buttons trim and weave could not be any better not only that but it looks terrific with everything the sweater has a flattering line that tapers at the waist even unbuttoned it is soft warm and cl"
this is a great skirt to add to your closet i love it it is comfortable soft and has detail to it i enjoy wearing it for work or a night out
dress just arrived and i was a bit nervous of the fit based on the other six reviewers stating it runs small i actually found it to run exactly true to size im   slender and on average i wear a size  which is what i ordered   regular and it fits as though it was custom made for me this dress is made very well  looks tailored and hits me right above the knee similar to the model i feel i scored big by purchasing it at the sale price
usually red tops which are a true red are hard to find this is more red in person that in the photo great feel to material and the drape is wonderful sometimes peplum tops can make me look bigger than i am  and  lbs but this one has a nice slimming effect and the vneck is complimentary to a smaller bust  love it 
this dress runs very large i am  and  lbs hourglass curvy build i ordered a size small and its enormous on me the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all its like a big wool sack id have to gain  lbs for this dress to come close to fitting im very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes including petite i never normally buy petite clothes but i think i would have to get a petite xs if it were available the dress lo
"this dress is lovely the colors seem a bit more muted than as reflected on model otherwise looks very similar to photo it has a slimline style and is very flattering the dress has a more casual appearance than as is reflected in the photo its really more of a day dress than a special occasion dress notwithstanding another reviewers opinion to the contraryi ordered up a size due to reading other reviews i found it to be a bit larger than i wanted so i washed and tumble dried it on low"
this is a cute shirt but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular flap its not visible from the photo i think itll have to be returned for this reason
"i bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptlyit runs quite large in my opinion im  and about  the small was huge on me in the chest and shouldersarms the stomach also wasnt very fitted the material is thinner than i expected you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light but i dont think this is a problem necessarily had it been thicker it probably would be too warm but you might need a slip"

i took a chance on this top because i liked the style i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen this is rayon and spandex sure why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box if the fabric would have been my preference it would have been a keeper i did not like the feel nor the semisheer quality maybe it would work for you but not for me back it went
dress is comfortable feels great and the fit exceeds flattery the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute fun but still classic detail that i didnt notice in the picture online i love this dress and get so many compliments
i agree with other reviewers that the material is pretty thin and it would make a far better swimsuit coverup or pajamas than an actual dress  unless you dont mind that it is semi seethru however that said i do love it it is soft the cut on top is nice and the strappy back is pretty and it is flattering  as long as your tummy is fairly flat because it does hug your body as you move so no bread and pasta i have worn it a couple of times already and i have received compliments on
wow this is the perfect sweater beautiful soft color lightweight enough to wear now and into the coming seasons it drapes beautifully the knit is tight no see through or snags very soft and comfy the casual easy pulled together look is hard to do and this one does it with style am starting to love this designer highly recommend
this top is perfect i absolutely love this sweater it is super cute to wear with shirts for the summer and it will look just as cute with jeans for the fallwinter the color is very subtle and not too pink it is super soft and i would  recommend this to someone
love this top  it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch it is light weight and not too long or wide i have other tla tops in small but the xsm worked better for me with this top
"i absolutely love these shorts they are the perfect length too i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years its hard to find shorts that arent super short yet arent bermuda and are still flattering i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighsmidsectionrolls are not sewn on both ends so youll have to reroll each washwish you carried these basics at all times"
tla got it right this time love the fabric the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green exactly as pictured the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons exactly as it looks on line i certainly recommend this top love it
i love everything about this jacket so much that i had to buy three colors greyrustteal not only is it figure flattering its warm water repellent easily layered and well made the little pop of color contrast added to the stripe seam makes it unique i would say sizing is tts to a bit large the only thing that would improve the coat is better finishing of the hems
i really love the color of this item it is very generous in cut i would suggest sizing down as i like my clothes more fitted i received many compliments among my colleagues who wearing
i love this dress the fabric feels amazing  is super flattering i am  with broad shoulders  a  chest and went with the small petite i originally purchased the regular extra small which looked great i just think the sp was slightly neater though the shoulders  length it hits me above the knee as shown in the photo of the light colored dress with the long vest
this seems to be designed to fit a bit loose but not in a bad way for me the floral pattern on the collar with the polka dots on the rest of the dress are very cute and i think this can look good with or without a belt light for summer but still covers a lot which is nice for the office the sleeves are a little short but it doesnt look bad glad i snatched it
i ordered a xxs petite based on previous reviews but it was too short and snug in the shoulders i then tried on the regular xs and it fit nicey loose but it is the style shoulders fit i usually need xs petite so kind of true to size to me i am  and  lbs color is nice i liked the blue polka dot with flowery tie neck the tie neck is a nice on trend feature can be tired at different heights for different looks i think i will keep the xs regular
material is a little think and they run a bit long like many other retailer pants otherwise a great deal if you get them on sale
wanted to love this dress  pretty fabric and colors i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman im  ordered a s this just looked like a nightgown on me sorry to say its going back
this one is a mustbuy i have  of the longer sleeve version the tegan dress and one of these i am about to buy more of the lola short sleeved version these dresses are flattering and comfortable they can be worn as a tunic with leggings or a dress they are great for travel if you roll them they dont wrinkle they can be dressed up or down my sister and i have very different figures and this dress looks great on both of us i cant recommend a dress more the lola and the tegan are t
i absolutely love everything about this top i bought it in the taupenavy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer the neckline and sleeves seem tailorfitted for my body i dont often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect lengthshape to be incredibly flattering theyre in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regularlength the neckline is eq
i absolutely love this topthe color style fiteverything i took another reviewers advice and sized down from my normal large to a medium i have had so many compliments wearing this top it is very feminine flows nicely hangs well love the color cant recommend this enough
was excited for this shirt i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material so i went with a medium i was swimming in it definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal
wow this didnt work for me loved the red color and drape and subtle shine of the fabric but it fit like a sack and you could see deeply into the armpits from the side revealing my bra and more way too long i looked silly maybe it was the size im  and ordered the large this was my first retailer dress order but im not giving up maybe the petite would have been a better fit dont think ill try again with this one however
i ordered my usual size and i think the length and the top chestarms for great however the bottom is more of a swing style than a straight or slight aline as depicted in the stock photo there is too much fabric in the stomach area and just not flattering
i love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty great combo has a shabby chic feel the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body  not fitted which i like
i purchased this dress for a baby shower and it was just perfect i am  and  pounds and ordered the petite xs which fit great the dress is supposed to be a tad oversized and flowy so this size worked out great for me it will also be a nice transition piece into spring with a pair of black fringe booties  overall i recommend this dress
very cute on fits well versatile top i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall
its really not in my typical wheelhouse i took a chance based on reviews the shorts are long and roomy enough and i love it with the longsleeves i somehow feel less exposed in it than i thought i would i do agree with the comment that the material feels pretty flimsy for the price point thats a bummer

one of my first rompers its super cute i need to get used to the puffy sleeves but my husband also really likes it and hes definitely got an opinion about these things
i bought this dress when i saw it go on sale and i am glad i did love how it fits the length everything about it it is true to size and it looks very flattering i will be wearing it for my anniversary date with my husband highly recommend i am  lbs  and the size  fit perfectly
"this top is very pretty and looks expensive and as picturednice pattern and could be dressed up or downthe gathered neck is beautiful and has a bit if a stretch however the back of the top has strange bat winglike design element that seem unnecessary and distract from the elegance of the rest if the topsadly i think i may send it back"
"love love this dress the fit is perfect the cut is feminine and flirty but not too showy and bare there is the perfect amount of swing and its a great length i cant say enough about it i think its worth the price which i have to admit i was hesitant about so comfortable and versatile i see it being worn quite oftenkeep dresses like this comingbtw the neck line is flattering on every body typefor reference im  and weigh  lbs and i purchased a size  but i think a"

i dont think the sweater looks like the one pictured its pretty and i love off the shoulder sweaters but i have to say its a little scratchy and its a lighter grey than what shows on my computer screen if i hadnt gotten it on sale and with an additional birthday discount i would send it back it also runs big i got an xss and it fits perfectly im  and weigh  i usually wear a medium in most things and am a size  i like it a lot but i dont love it it also reeked of patchouli
this dress is flattering and seems to be made well the polka dots add interest i am usually a  and did go up to a  in this 
"like other ladies have mentioned this dress runs small in the chest and waist region you must size uppros flattering fit and flow hides lumps and bumps cut at the neck and back is cute and didnt make me look chunky surprisingly little red polka dots arent overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel good overall length usa madecons runs small in the chest and waist im a  hourglass  lbs and normally can wear a size  in tops"

i just received these pants and they are really cute they are casual but i think with a cute topjacket and heels they can be appropriate for a fun night out or casual date they are really comfortable but they do stretch so size down for sure i am  and weigh  lbs and wear a  in antho pants that arent chino fabric but wear a  in designer jeans i ordered a  and can probably wear a  when these stretch out i will keep the  but they will be baggy i ordered the kakhi and the
this caught my eye and i tried it on the in the store today the green i found it to run a little bit large  i expected the small to fit but the xs fit me better better fit in armholes and also less billowy i really like the way it looks but ulitimately did not purchase it today i might reconsider on sale the flaws in my opinion are that it is dry clean only the skirt is not lined and should be and its a bit overpriced for the quality but on the other hand its very cute and f
i want to address that with lightweight but not too skimpy for the summertime and the stress works perfectly i got the red in a small and although one reviewer said that she did not like that the top and bottom are two different materials i actually think its super cute not sure if i would pay the full price but the  off sale made it worth it
"i received this for christmas this year and have already worn it several days in a row it is warm enough to wear while walking the dog in the snow and can also be worn to lounge around the housethe only reason i didnt rate it a  is due to the design fact that it doesnt have pockets i dont love to carry a purse around all of the time so i use my coat pockets a lot regardless though i would definitely recommend this especially for the price i was expecting to come here and see this pric"
the top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy  it also feels cheap to the touch  i love the idea but cant keep it for this priceim a shorty so id have to hem it too sadly will return
i ordered these in eptites tey were a ltitle long still also a tiny bit on the loose side i am not sure i think they are worth as much as they cost so wil lwait for hte sale color combination was nice thougha dn the cut relatively flattering i jsut ahve seen better out there for hte price nice businesscasual pant
this sweater is adorable i got it in the grey pattern its got a great forgiving fit lots of stretch with a hilow waist in a thick soft knit and  sleeves the contrasting collar and cuffs add interest its great with jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks i cant wait for the weather to cool down so i can wear it i might get it in more colors too its a great basic
i seriously love this top and at the sale price its a steal i ordered the ivory color and its just as beautiful in person as in the product photos i thankfully read the reviews and knew that the sleeves would be slit i think the slit sleeves add more interest to an otherwise basic blouse it can be dressed up or down and is great for work at least in my very casual office the fit is perfect i ordered my normal size medium and its definitely truetosize

fits perfectly super soft and wellmade love the  sleeves and back drop i can expect i will wear a lot in this coming fallwinter season in ca highly recommend
love the asymmetrical zipper style fabric and color so soft comfy and warm i got a size small and it fits perfectly and isnt tight or loose the pockets are sewn shut but easily opened by cutting the thread with scissors highly recommend this cute and functional jacket
this dress is so versatile the knit top is nicely structured and the flowy skirt is forgiving and flattering i bought the white gray and poppy colored one and i think its smashing
i had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale when i pulled it out of the package i could not believe how soft it was literally as a cloud think of the softest fluffiest baby blanket also the cut is extremely flattering i am   lb and the medium fit me perfectly flowing but not boxy love it
i was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased hoping to try something new theyre not attractive the slit stays open with any movement i dont think it would be appropriate for work  overall the fit is true to size i otherwise liked the design but the sleeves made this a quick return 
so the other review complained that there are slits on the sleeves of this blouse yes that is true however i love that about this blouse i tried this blouse on in the store so the slits were not a surprise to me but i can understand how they may upset a customer who wasnt expecting them i think the slits are elegant and are in no way obtrusive or revealing you could totally still wear this blouse to work or a nice dinner i love it because its unique enough to be worn alone and simple i
i thought id like this dress in the neutral color i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didnt help the top fit well in my usual  petite i think it would look nice on some people as its something different but i am not one of those it worked on
i love this dress i bought the blue one and i love the designs i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant it flows nicely and is super comfortable
i went to my local retailer store in kansas citymo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because its so soft and very flattering on my body type i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money
this dress is such a lovely thing to have in my closet its so easy to pull on but adding a nice pair of shoes a piece of jewelry and leaving my hair down reveals a gorgeous outfit that takes next to no time i must admit my local store didnt stock this dress so i wasnt quite expecting the texture of the fabric i was expecting it to be smooth but its almost ribbed its soft and comfortable though so thats certainly not a deal breaker i only wish theyd had it in petite as i feel t
pilcro has become my go to brand for pants as they always seem to fit with consistent sizing  im an  and size  never fails to fit perfectly  ive got hips and a booty so its great to have a brand that works with my curves  these chinos are super soft and feel like pants ive had for years  broken in but still look polished  i bought the green which is really teal and feel in love with them ive since bought the gray and sandkhaki color  im  and the length hits just below

i purchased the red color in august after seeing it in the store it is cozy and stylishlove the coordinating pattern in the cowl neck i am  and  lbs and the s fit great noticed that it is now on special promotion and would advise you purchase now it is completely worth full price but if you can save and buy say a coordinating pilcro pant all the better right
first of all the colors are really pretty fabrics feel really nice but the fit was no bueno i think if you are tall and small chested this dress would look great but im short and large chested and it was very unflattering when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid it doesnt hang nicely due to my chest sadly this is a return for me

great looking casual dress but im not sure about the fit on me the skirt drape may be a tad overwhelming on my short legs if i want to emulate the styling of the green model bodice fabric is a nice clingy but lined stretch material of medium thickness the skirt is a thin crepe viscoserayon without a lining and i think it really needs one i was hoping the skirt was the same material mix like the elysian maxi i picked the medium petite and sizing down would be appropriate for ladies with
this gorgeous ampampamp beautiful dress is hampered by a seethrough unlined bodice and all viscosepolyester fabrication  by the way did you see the price tag  at least the skirt is lined  if you have deep pockets and dont mind the slightly rough fabric go for it  and wear a nice bra  size up if youre busty
love everything about this dress  i ordered the red which is more of a red orange  with cream and beige  as pictured colors are beautiful the dress has a nice drape  great feel love it 
this is a well made sweater i sometimes have a problem with wool but this is as soft as cashmere and does not itch at all the color is beautiful and will work with grayblacktan and navy i found this to run a little bit on the large side i am between a size large and extra large and ordered the extra large there is too much fabric on the sides and the peplum starts at an awkward spot mid hip instead of waistline i think that sizing down to a large will solve these problems it is really
saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer first thing i did was touch it to feel if its soft and it felt like butta surprisingly its a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking i hate turtleneck choke and big cowl neck reminds me of the  but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus since i

purchased this sweater in an xs grey pattern for reference  small frame and was worried it would be too overwhelming this is not the case the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right it seems to be true to size i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves its a little pricey but i think it will be worth it because it is so different
this sweater is gorgeous ordered in the grey motif was as described and wonderfully soft i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs looking forward to the colder months
this is my kind of clothing item i love linen stripes pockets and a loose look in an over piece it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style it does not have any neck closure which may bother some i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p
i was immediately drawn to this dress when i saw it in the store im normally a size  but i feel like the size two was too constricting in the chest and arms so found a size  to be just right its longer and a bit wider than the size  everywhere else but given the design i thought it was fine the main thing to note is that the top is snug and has no give whatsoever if you have a larger bust or broader shoulders sizing up is a must lengthwise it fit me like it does on the model i t
i was confused by this dress the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy its also not lined and the material is not exactly soft i put it back cute but missed the mark
"i really like this dressshirt its great for layering super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this years pregnancy weight gain i think it will be so cute with some leggings and bootsunfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size this may sound weird but ive tried on an  and a  and the ability to reach forward didnt change between the two sizes i just returned the  and am hopeful the  i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back"
it is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day
very unique shirt you will get a compliment the material has a great feel and weight beautiful color it runs true to size
i think this dress is adorable  it fits great wear it with heels or cowboy boots you will not be disappointed
tried this dress on in the store and could barely button at my chest but the waist and length were perfect ordered a size up and two sizes up online went with the two sizes up because it did not pull as bad across the chest though now its a bit blousey around the waste fabric is a little thin similar to other reviews the slip is a little weirdwonky im keeping it because i like the idea of the dress but im not sure about the lifespan with how gauzy the material is
i am not sure why this is listed on the website at hd in paris because i purchased this shirt in carmel ca and it is actually maeve which is a brand i buy often and always fits me well this piece did not disappoint this is a fun and versatile black top but has a little edge with its design and i know that i will get a lot of use out of it i dont find the fabric to be rough at all but it is textured which i just think adds to the interest of this piece i am a  and did not find my c
i bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings it seemed like it would be a nice light summer dress that i could wear all day i do think it fits that qualification however it wasnt as flattering as i hoped im generally pear shaped  small waist larger hips this dress does fit well over my hips but does very little to show off my waist overall it is just ok
ive been looking for the right red dress for a while and this one is a winner flattering fit comfy quality fabricmakes me feel great even right after having a baby fits tts and i cant wait to rock this beauty
"i bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants at  the tunic felt like it added height and even though im a  the top fit well across the bust i tried on the large first and it felt very comfortable but a bit big the medium fit a little more snugly but was more proportional in the arms so i purchased it insteadthe neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst"
these are the perfect tightsfit and feel are top quality and they wash well
i own a couple of pairs of natori hipsters and recently purchased the yellow to go with the front close natori bra i tried to wear thong panties but they just didnt work for me thankfully natori makes these lovely panties that still make me feel sexy and they are way more comfortable they also receive rave reviews from my husband  
i love this tunic it has an unusual neckline with decorative stitching and beautiful buttonsi like the slight sheen of the fabric as well wearing it makes me feel elegant without sacrificing comfort im going to wear it for work with black leggings and on weekends with jeans i suspect it will also be great to travel in the only potential downsides might be the deep side slit and the fact that it has to be dry cleaned
what i cant believe this got so many mixed reviews i wasnt sure what to expect and now that ive received it i think its absolutely perfect its flattering the length is great its tts and the color is beautiful i have no issues with the skirt whatsoever either  im really pleased with this purchase and i cant wait to wear it
cute little sleep mask the elastic band is wide so it doesnt ever feel like its digging into your head does a very good job keeping out light
i love pilcro script jeans the rise is super comfortable and the fabric stretch is perfectly flattering without being too tight the wash is great from the pictures i didnt realize this pair had the fringed bottom rather than the hem but they cuff easily if you want to hide it plus with boot season approaching i think it will make boots more comfortable without the bulky hem i wish they would make this cut with all of their products  would love to see a pair of cords or dress pants
"this says online only hwoever the balc one was in my store and some other colros too anyway i actually liked this top it is more flattering than the model shows i think i could wear this with pants or legginss in botos on me the regualr size is almost a dress should i be younger but i do like that i did debate ordering petite and decided not to it is thin enough to not be too hot indoors and sublte stripes on the black versionnoyte previous reviewer mentioend something about"
i love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline wouldnt sit right overall the fit was boxy and unflattering the fabric is pretty but the style is wellboring there was just no wow factor for me i think the fabric deserved a much better design imho i think this top might be better suited fo

i have the marrakech vest from the summer and really liked the quality and fit of that so i ordered this one fit is very similar this one is made of a lightweight cotton and has a similar cut will be a great fall transitional jacket and looks great with lots of thingsmaxi skirts skinny jeans long tops with the hems peaking out etc i found it tts i got an xs and am   lbs i dont plan to wear more than a thin top underneath but dont think i could fit a sweater under the sle
this skirt ran short small and boxy if you can get the right fit the skirt is great quality and super cute but i recommend trying on in store for sizing
this was not what i was expecting at all i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around   the large fit like a small on me and not like a typical oversized sweater type small but a normal fitted top small a previous reviewer said it is long and straight and i think that is a good description for it i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extralarge or a different cut of the

i ordered this online but i own the vest and i love it so i took a chance this is a super comfy great quality jacket the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive the color i ordered the green is perfect i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking they look exactly like the picture so if you dont mind that you will probably be very happy with this jacket it just wasnt for me i ended
"this top is simple but beautiful i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl it is a swing top but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing i am around  and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at alli love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i likea great staple for your closet"
description is wrong not a swing tunic more long and straight keep that in mind when buying this if you have hips this might not be the top for you
i cant think of many things more comfortable than cloth  stones fabric so when i saw this jumpsuit i had to try it it is a nice midweight perfect for fall weather or a mild winter like we are currently having in the northeast looks very cute with a duster cardigan over it fits true to size meant to fit a little loosely length is great everywhere on my  frame feels like wearing pajamas with the benefit of looking puttogether
i know that some folks said it runs small but i am usually a size small or medium in dresses and the medium feels big to me that being said it definitely works and i think itll be great excited to dress it up with accessories feels professional enough for me to teach in
i got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design  i like it so much more than i expected to  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but  stick out too much  i love the green color too  i tie the ties on the back of the dressat the level of my shoulder bladesrather than on top as in the photo  i think it looks cuter that way  so glad i took a chance on it
"i have seen this dress for a while and was holding off but then i decided to try it on the regualar size in store to keep in mind for my next binge the cut is flattering length is jsut above my knee so i would not get the petite on this one i would as others have mentioend wear it with a belt overall it fits like a nice comfy tshirt with comfy skirt but as a dress very nice"
i only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product it is very comfortable and for a jerseystyle shirt quite warm but that is one of my issues with the shirt i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think itll be just too warm i live in the northeast i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected which was another negative for me i wanted it to be more fitted to my body however i did keep it because
this was way better than i expected it to be tts and flattering the material on the top section is on the thinner side but is very soft and comfortable the skirt section is a little on the shorter side for me but with tights i think i could still make it wearable for work
took another reviewers advice and sized up to an xl unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasnt attractive love the color and its dreamy soft the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy it clings and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large sadly returned
dont think the photo does this skirt justice its a very flattering fit the kind of skirt youll wear all summer
if any of you have read the book or watched the movie sisterhood of the traveling pants then you will understand this analogy i am convinced that this dress hugs everyone in the right places it looks kind of boring on a hanger but has an incredible fit that complimented my waist so much i instantly felt tinier in every trouble area of my body although the design of this dress is casual i feel that it can easily be dressed up for a nice brunch or meeting i love basic clothing designs tha
easy to wear and very cute especially for curvy ladies but i think it looks best worn with a best or a blazer on top something to emphasize the waist a bit more
this cardigan is defined by comfort it is of a lovely knitted like material and is very warm the pockets are great for holding your phone and the billowy sleeves make you feel like you are wrapped in a blanket
seriously most comfortable pants ever fabric feels very luxe are they dressy enough for the office i dont care they feel that great
this dress is really really soft and comfortable its loose but still flattering i would definitely recommend it
i may wear these every day i am obsessed i am   normally a size  in jeans i ordered these in a  and they fit like a glove they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel i am extremely happy with this purchase these are a must have staple in anyones wardrobe
very nice but thin materal very sheer i paired with the palmarosa wide legs loved the way it looked i do think the sale price is a bit high for this shirt though
i got this before the winter so i could wear it for summer and fall it is light wave material for summer and fall i think it would be good for spring time toothe color of this pants is more natural so it is easy to march any color of topsi really enjoy it
i really love cloth  stone and this top did not disappoint i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly it has a nice drape to it and is super soft i will add that when looking at the picture i didnt notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid however there is a really light pink to it as well i actually w
this is a beautiful dress i sized up  sizes based on other reviews and it fits well it is on the shorter side i purchased the blue and its a beautiful color i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes i think im going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper
this dress is so soft and comfortable great winter staple i purchased the blue motif which really doesnt have any blue on it the stripes are fun and make this the perfect dress to throw on and feel great while staying comfortable
this dress is adorable its easy to wear really comfortable and i think looks great on im  i probably should have gotten a petite  the shortest part of the dress meets my knees the fabric is quite soft flows like jersey  it does seem to be a little cheaper and i cant speak to durability yethoping it holds up
i didnt think id like this due to the high neck but i was in the store and it was so soft that i tried it on in the black motif this dress is so comfortable and flattering its definitely a versatile piece dress down with a denim jacket or dress up with heels and it has pockets
i bought the multicolor stripe and it is adorable i am   lbs and purchased a size small it is a perfect length and drapes wellnot too tight at all i received a ton of compliments the first time i wore it highly recommend
outstanding dress looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come i couldnt decide which color way i liked in this dressthe redwhite or the green so i purchased both i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtimesummer dress yes the cut runs small but i dont think it is as small as some of the other reviews i typically wear i size  and this one the  fit perfectly so maybe one size up
"i have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version but it just didnt work nearly as well the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra the black pattern was also nothing special i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel  would consider getting it if it went on sale i tried on the small and the extra small  didnt notice a difference between the two i think i have on the xs in the photo"

i bought this online so didnt realize that the fabric at the bottom is very very stiff i was expecting something silky or at least on the softer and more moveable side the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt that being the case it kind of juts out in weird places the sweater part is very nice but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o
this dress is completely versatile and great to wear as is or add a vest or chunky sweater for a layer i bought it late last week and love the fit and comfort of the jersey knit fabric also you cant beat the price for an retailer dress
this dress is absolutely flattering and will make you feel beautiful fabric is thin but can easily be transitioned from fall to winter to spring hugs all the right places true to size i am  and  curvy and the small fit well i am so happy with this purchase great price point as well
"just got this dress in the orange print and i cant begin to say how much i love it looks even better in person than online and its super flattering love the neckline armholes are perfect and show off toned arms and shoulders  this is the kind of dress that makes time spent at the gym worthwhile the fabric is light and stretchy and the pockets are an extra bonusi would say fit is tts but keep in mind that its very loose at the bottom so i would go down in size if you want a less loo"
i finally pressed go on the orange dress during the weekend sale the dress is terrific i am a busty  size  and the m fits perfectly based on the reviews i had planned to take this to the tailor to take in the armholes but it is not necessary at all  no bra showing in front or back i am  and the shortest part of the hem is about  above my knee there is no lining so i might add a short pullon slip depending on where i wear it but otherwise this is an easy dress to be w
this dress is really lovely i purchased in the blue green color and think the pattern and ribbon detailing is gorgeous it runs very small  i am normally a  in maeve and in this dress due to the length ended up with a  regular i like my dresses to fit and could have gone with the   it fit well at the waist but was tighter than i prefer across the chest and wanted a more comfortable fit as other reviewers have noted it has a higher waist which i think contributes to the sizing issue

i have never purchased this brand before at retailer and there were no reviews on it when i purchased it  i bought my usual size medium and it fit perfectly  i am   with broad shoulders  loved the fringe on the top and i think it will be very versatile   jeansboots skirtsheels   definitely a keeper  as a petite gal this was not overly long  if you have larger hips this will not hang well
this dress is super cute and has the most striking color i got the blue i just love it its comfortable and flattering and hits me in all the right places i am a petite girl and normally wear a  or  in retailer dresses and as the other reviewers mentioned this runs small so a  was what i needed and even the  does not leave any wiggle room that said i like my dresses to fit sort of snugly so it works for me i highly recommend it overall  the quality cut color and comfort all ma
"i am   pounds  and ended up with the size small for reference it fit well but definitely roomy  in case youre not into that style never tried the extra small but i would prefer this dress not to hug onto me so i stayed with the small this dress was really nice and comfy soft material the pockets are low and my phone stayed in while i walked but i wouldnt recommend anything heavier than a phone to go in the pockets i wore this to a family and friends function and re"
theres a stretch and a swing to the dress that makes you feel light and free really sexy as pictured with boots and scarf
"soft and flowy fit is great quality is great i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well i havent worn a dress in  years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first highly recommendi paired this with  short black suede boots and black tights many compliments even from my husband and he doesnt usually pay much attention"
this dress is so comfortable and versatile you can dress it up or down and its perfect for almost any summer occasion i have it in the black color and it goes with almost everything the only complaint i have is the arm holes drop a little too low you can see part of my bra because of this but its not too drastic im  with an athletic build and i feel like the petite would have fit me better regardless its a great dress
i tried a size x small on in the store and i am   lbs i had trouble getting my head through the dress and once i did it felt so tight at the neck as if it was chocking me the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no i would not recommend this dress for those reasons
i love this dress its very comfortable slim swing and very ingratiating the fabric is light i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves overall im pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress i will definitely recommend it
"i almost ordered this dress yesterday online but did not i went into my local retailer today and they had it in stock tried it and completely fell in love with it and even my retailer lady in the back was amazedi am   and went with the xs petiteexcellent price pointgorgeous in neutralttshighly recommend"
this swing dress is very cute and easy to wear i ordered the orange print and the black because i couldnt decide the orange looked washed out against my skin color but the black was a keeper i am usually a small but ordered one in the small and one in the extra small since it is a swing dress and they usually run large the top is mostly the same fit so i think i may keep the extra small even still there is a lot of extra fabric the rayon is a little on the cheap side but it is so comforta
to my surprise this sweater is heavy chic and stylish its well made and fits tts im looking forward to wearing it i would recommend this tunic to everyone it looks better on me than the modelevent though it doesnt look bad you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater i really like all the different textures in this sweater
"im an xl in retailer tops and the xl fits nicely in this blouse if you are athletic or slender or have a petite bust you can probably size downthis is a nice lightweight sweater i would not say that it is too thin or anything like that its just lightweight for being categorized as a sweater i absolutely love the pattern placement of this sweater it makes the sweater so unique and figure flattering honestly im not crazy about kimonobell sleeves because i feel they are at best impr"
i live in ny and bought his coat for the winter thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm this coat is extremely thing more like a springfall coat and therefore i dont think the price justifies the quality i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely
this dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it i love absolutely anything with a full shape and this dress has it its cut like a circleso ladies this dress has a lot of fabric im  and wouldnt be able to wear it as a dress but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings the arms are a tad more fitted though i have larger arms which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine if you love a cool quirky piece this one is a winner
the blue looks a lot more grey in person and ive gotten several compliments wearing it with black leggings and grey booties the textureprint is really unique im    pounds and a small fits perfect highly recommend
i was looking forward to this cute top to get me through the winter but the combination of the very think fabric and boxy shape did not work on my   lb  figure the one i received also had an open unfinished seam beneath the zipper i imagine this would be a great top for someone taller
i had no idea this was considered sleepwear until after i bought it i saw it in the store and promptly tried it on it is really flattering i wear it as a sweater dress on a regular basis it is really comfortable and is something you could dress up with booties or be more casual with cute tennis shoes like keds i get compliments on it all the time i also like the slit a lot
i really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great however the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like  not my  self

this dress is lovely  i am   athletic and busty  ddd  but not super slim so not easy to petite items that fit in the chestarms i ordered pm which usually works and it was actually too big in the chest im waiting on the ps but think it will work since the cut is generous materialitem is so lovely and comfortable i never have extra chest room so this was such a great surprise hope the ps is great but think it will be unless they went crazy on making it to small

i think the model photo doesnt do this dress justice its comfortable and perfect for a summery day i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan and of course it works well causally im busty d on a small frame  but theres not gapping the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish
i wasnt expecting much out of this when i was in the store but liked the colors and thought id try it out grabbed a s and xs im usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes  the s fit perfectly tts and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit it does have a detachable slipliner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on mefalling low
ref     i dont think this is for us shorter women this hits you right where you dont want a vertical line to hit it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldnt even dream of making this work i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me glad i tried instore and didnt online order
love this comfy breezy dress so easy  cool to wear around the hood or casual dinner out i gave  stars for quality because of a small gap in seam near one of the pockets which ill fix next time the sewing basket is out i think the double layers of gauzelike material makes the dress a little delicate if you have animals so be a careful around claws  paws the back side is straight which isnt as interesting as the front but for my use the dress is darling
"this dress runs largei tried on a large then a medium and then a small couldnt believe i fit a small this is a cool breezy summer ensemble that you can wear anywhere dress it up or down its comfy and makes you feel like you can breathe under its baggy motif love it"
there were only  pairs left in my store and they had my size they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color i would definitely recommend i may buy the floral embroidery ones too
this dress looks way better than pictured online it is lyocel i think so it has a little bit of weight not heavy and bulky like denim but not as thin as some chambray items ive purchased before and lays great i purchased a size small i am   and thought it was true to size i cant wait to wear this warm weather sandals and a tote for running errands
"i am so pleased with my purchase the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique the attached matching adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful i am   and a  if you have been considering this dress dont delay especially at the wonderful sale price"
i like these jeans when i wore them i received compliments they do run large i sized down one size but probably could have sized down two sizes they feel tight when you first put them on but as you wear them they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist my other complaint is a small one the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move after awhile my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it that is why i gave this only  stars for desi
i love the look and feel of  this easy dress i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip however i was in between sizes the medium  a bit too small and the large just too big this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type especially in a madras plaid
i stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available when it did i was very excited in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me unfortunately neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts dont fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
"this is my go to cool summer dress its very light and airy and extremely comfortable great for  degree dayshighly recommend"
i love the length of this  no danger of explosing my muffintop the fabric is super cute  good weight pretty color i got a medium which is a bit blousy  i think i could have gone with a small
this top is really cute and can be worn off shoulder or not  the embroidery is really pretty  my only comment would be the top is shorter than i expected if you wear it off shoulder its of course longer but still shorter than i would have preferred  keeping it anyways as it will be a fun going out casual top
i bought this in both the black motif and the ivory i got a size  and i would say it is true to size the fabric is very comfortable and doesnt wrinkle easily it does have a flowy look to it but i didnt find that it had too much fabric i wouldnt tuck it in though i find it looks really good with skinny jeanspants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique i recommend the shirt
the quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty it just made me look super wide i feel like the waist is too high  not quite empire and not quite at the waist it just wasnt going to work for my body maybe a different size would work but i dont like it enough to try
i got the dark blue print which is a really pretty pattern the fabric has a nice crinkly feel and the cut is very forgiving i thought from the pictures it would be more of a traditional button down with straight lines it actually is a looser fit but without the trapeze shape of some swing tops which i have found to be less flattering for those of us who are curvier on the bottom half its comfortable and flattering could be tucked in or worn out and likewise dressed up or worn casually wi
i really wish i could keep this top the material is okay and i have noticed with this brand shirts made from this material do not wash well or look that nice after a wash if you have the time to dry clean then i would  recommend this top another tip if you buy this since i didnt read the description the top has buttons all down the front i am not a fan of button tops because i have a larger chest so i wouldnt recommend this top to someone who is busty

i purchased this in blue it has a soft fabric and seems well made i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable i bought one size up due to comments on the site but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart
easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits i am petite   but like the longer look of a top so went with  thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with  there is a lot of excess material around the sidesand back i was tempted to return but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute i kept it i think it will go through the a few seasons seattle is unpredictable weatherwise and can be easily layered i like the blousebut dont love
i think this jumpsuit is different the xs fit well and the material is a pretty color but very soft the store had it styled with a metallic scarf that really accessorized it well  i thought it would be great for my date night but stopped short of buying because i just cant picture this worn to other outings  it is very unique though so i just might be back to purchase
finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my apparently giant hulk arms but its so flowyswingy i had to return it this might just be a problem with being a larger lady but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look  bigger than i was around my waisthips even when balanced out with leggings i thought about trying to size down but wasnt sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms of course i cant try
i usually wear a  in retailer dresses and i was surprised the xs fit better than the s very pretty really perfect color for fall i like that its not tight or constricting so you can wear it for every day and not feel like its difficult to move around the longer length is nice too for bonus that its not dry clean only my only problem with this dress is its all polyester which is just cheap fabric if it wasnt for that id give it  stars
cute shorts with great fabric and lined so they lay smooth over your body i really love that the material has a dressier feel but they ran a bit large and looked sort of frumpy on me curvy body   im returning them and trying a small elastic waist is great for me after having a baby but would look just fine under a belt or covered by a shirt
ive worn this shirt approx  times to work each time someone comments on how much they like it im attempting to add more color to my workwear this shirt tends to swing so much i feel exposed that is the biggest drawback

this jumpsuit is a classic i read the reviews where some were complaining about the buttons i did not have these issues maybe because i have short fingernails i like this jumpsuit because the style of it will be around for a long time you can dress the jumpsuit up or down i rarely pay full price but this jumpsuit is so greatfantastic that i did not mind doing so i strongly recommend this jumpsuit

this top makes you feel like you should be in the tropics sipping a frosty cocktail fabric is soft not too sheer im usually an xs and thats what i kept in this top armholes not too low as in some for reference   lbs
love the idea of this top but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap the quality reminds me of something you would buy for  at a market abroad definitely disappointed with the quality for the price will be retuning
this top can be dressed up or down i got it in the blue motif it is so cute and that wearable washable fabric i am a medical student so it is important for me to be able to wash my clothing and not wear things too lowcut ie professionalism this top fits the bill while still being fabulous of course it is loosefitting on the bottom as the image indicates it is a swing top i recommend with skinny pants
i just received this and wore it immediately  it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern peeks out giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not seethrough it is a fine knit and has a satinlike thread to it which makes it soft and cool  perfect for a summer day it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite   lb and i think this would run closer to tts
i was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on  minutes and  broken fingernails later i got done when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person so back it goes even if it had fit i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons why they didnt design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept
i love the bright floral print flanking the solid white middle in this top with its swing style and large arm holes i think i could have sized down and been ok but i usually wear a cami with my tanks so the arm holes are not an issue also it has a touch of spandex in it which make it extra comfy overall a darling top
i bought this recently after trying on both the small and xs for reference im smallframed   pounds size  in most clothes but cant wear petite sizes usually a small or medium in retailer tops i liked the fit and length of the small but the armholes were so big you could see the whole side of my bra no one wants to see anyones bra not even their bra straps id worn a white cami in under my tee that day so i put it on and it improved the side view but i didnt like the white
if you havent yet joined the jumpsuit bandwagon now is the time this jumpsuit is absolutely stunning classy elegant and a stand out piece i purchased at full price i have a hard time with jumpsuits as i am quite tall and they usually look like an adult onsie on me  this jumpsuit made me feel beautiful put together and graceful i cannot recommend it enough fit is true to size i am a  and purchased the  not too short in the crotch and i am almost  form fitting but still a bit f

i have about  or  akemi  kin tops i usually take a small i think this one runs a bit bigger the armholes are too deep and there is just too much fabric for me   i am going to try to size down because i really like everything else about the top orange is not my color but this has enough white to compensate the pattern button detail and fabric are all very nice
i cannot keep my hands off this gorgeous kimono  i want to wear it every day it goes with so much of my wardrobe its thin and cool both meanings of cool apply i like to keep my arms covered i think my upper arms are too fat and this kimono does just that while keeping me cool as a cucumber i wear a sleeveless white or gray cami under it and it is soooo comfortable i could sleep in it it would also look great with lime green cami and white pants so far i wear it with blue jeans an
i really love this shirt i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too its very comfortable and cute i got a lot of compliments when i wore it this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt so id advise everyone to size down
i love this top ive already worn it  times since getting it about  weeks ago it is beautiful and has a lovely subtle pattern to the fabric that i didnt initially see in the photo but then did and still wanted it it has a nice drape and is comfortable and flattering my only critique is that it comes up a little shorter on my torso than i expected i am a mediumsize  with  bust and the top comes to maybe  inches below my belly button i think its still flattering and comfortable
i just sent this back it is very cute  the fabric is great so soft  comfy but it doesnt work with my shape it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you dont have a large chest on me it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it am a  its not the fault of the top but a bigger size would have swallowed me i think if you are thin and also not topheavy like the model this will be adorable on you i am just too busty
i really love this top it looks great under a black tahari suit that i wear to work the neckline looks really nice the only negatives are that its a bit sheer so i have to wear a tank under it and its a little wide it looks fine tucked in or hanging out with jeans for a more casual look id recommend this top especially if you can get it on sale pretty true to size im   pounds and a  c and the size  top fit me nicely
love this dress the embroidery is stunning and adds to each detail of the dress i love the pink undertone it is subtle it makes it more unique this is why i love online exclusives they have that one of a kind look to them the quality is great and the style is that there really is no shape to it it has a nice everyday feel but along with its elegance can easily be dressed up as well priced a little high is my only complaint
i love this jumpsuit im usually a size small however i was a lot more comfortable in an xs the fit was comfortable and sexy i received a lot of compliments and a couple of i need to borrow that from you im only  tall so it went down all the way to my ankles but i paired it with  open toed heels and it worked the neck line is pretty high but you can adjust it to your comfort i highly recommend this jumpsuit even to the petite ladies
i think ive made a hobby out of trying on jumpsuits  rompers this season i now own three including this one in my usual size small  i passed right by this online but it drew my attention in the store i didnt realize it was chocolate brown and ivory im a sucker for brown i tried it on on a whim and it looked great i am tallalmost   and it looked great i will say it shows off my bottom for better or worse more than other jumpsuits it doesnt give me a wedgie but a
im another borderline petite at  and i loved this the pants are like palazzos on me and i think with a heel it will look great i plan on wearing my hair up and tying the tie in the back in a big bow in fact i dont see the button back spoken of in the description so i think one would have to do so

"this top is really pretty its a very strong embroidered lace all over front and back with small holes but the description states there is a polyester lining and this is unlined sothere are holes but i do not think this is immodest and needs a cami just wear a nude bra under it the holes are not revealing at allthe sizing is tts and is as shown in the photo i bought an xl because if a top isnt stretchy i need to wear a  or  this fits me only its not as loose in the bac"
im a little on the fence about this dress it doesnt do much for my fairly straightpetite body type ie its not fitted at the waist which i think would help even though i dont have much of a waist to begin with but the low vneck is flattering and the flared skirt is too its just that it probably looks better on an hourglass shape i was fine with the fabric type id describe it as a midweight ribbed knit blend id say its true to size i got my usual xspetite and im  
i really wanted to love this top but the fit was just off on me the design and material is so pretty however i expected the fit to be more peplum but there was not any structure i think this would be better on more slender women
i bought this top because i loved the floral print i had no idea i was getting a top notch quality top i love the flow of the bottom and the zipper in the back is so classy it has a lining and the coolest thing about it is the snaps that protect your bra from showing love love love this top
adorable peplum top colors are much more rich in person saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale beautiful material and craftsmanship i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase highly recommendgreat piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall
so i want to start off by saying the quality of this shirt really was great as was the pattern unfortunately if youre going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom its not a straight fit as the picture would suggest im sure this works for some women but if youre muscular with an already vshape to your body meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have
bought this on sale in my reg size  im  and about  the fabric is heavy and pretty this is a more formal top in my opinion it is lined it is much wider around the waist than appears on model zips up the back but i can pull on and off without unzipping
i like this dress very nice easy to wear everyday dress the top is lined but the bottom is a bit thin and unlined i dont think it was too sheer though it seems much of the quality of retailer is going down a bit disappointed overall in the quality of their dresses this year
when i saw this i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality would wash well but its pretty lightweight the fit is hugecould easily size down im   and found the small to be loose everywhere including the arms the length was at my knees and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest no idea what id wear this with even if it fit better sadly its going
i adore this maxi the fit style pattern black motif machine washability everything fits tts got my usual size s for   i would say that the length is appropriate  some are super long on me and im not one to wear heels i was also happy that the top fits nice and snug  my issue is usually that when i bend forward the top drapes open due to my small chest  no problem with this dress i think its perfect piece for springsummerfall and dressing up or down my one slight
this skirt is great the fabric is so soft and light i was hoping that the lower portion of the skirt wouldnt be too transparent and it wasnt the slip lining on the upper portion of the skirt is nice the color is exactly as shown i followed the advice of the only reviewer and sized up i shouldnt have the skirt was too big in the waist and too long so i exchanged and the fit was right on i think the skirt is meant to sit a little higher on the waist so keep that in mind the only t

this is my new favorite dress i cant tell you how flattering it is i just had a baby a few months ago and its the only piece of clothing i actually feel like i look like my old prebaby self in im on the shorter side  very busty because im nursing and about  lbs i got a mp and it fits great i could have gotten the small but i feel that would have been too low cut honestly love the cut the pattern everything about it would buy again

i think its a cute dress but nothing spectacular that being said i get a lot of compliments its a very flattering cut but i wish it was more colorful not just black and white im   lbs and got the s i could have probably gotten the xs too but im happy with how the s fits great length too since i often have a hard time finding dresses that are long enough for me
i love this dress my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish but are also very comfortable this dress fit the bill the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online and the fabric is so soft it almost feel like wearing pajamas the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely and so its flattering overall a great addition to my springsummer wardrobe
this dress is wonderful wide enough straps for a bra to be concealed lovely pattern that draws the eye down instead of across and a waistband that hits at the narrowest part of your midsection making it look supertiny the design is simple but very cleverits feminine flattering and slimming my only quibble is that its quite long and im almost  in my stocking feeti will have to wear heels or have it hemmed highly recommend
took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern i almost got the black because i thought it would be timeless but the print is so fun  im glad i went with it ordered a size m  for reference i am     and the fit is comfortable i dont need a lot of support  and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom i think itll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip this is the first onepiece ive had since i was a gi
another perfect maxi from retailer the print is feminine and can be easily dressed up or dressed down i ordered my normal size in maxis medium and the top fits nice and snug but not too tight i am busty and the neckline is high enough that i dont feel like i am showing too much cleavage it is a little long on me when i have flip flops on but with a little platform sandal it will be perfect
bought this for my girlfriend and she couldnt be happier shes a size  and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable highly recommend
i cant get enough of this dress this dress is everything from the flattering fit to the colors and pattern to the design and to the quality this dress really has it all this is worth every penny and in my opinion a great price for a versatile high quality dress the material is that super comfy stretchy material which is perfect for everyday it is a no brainer and easy to throw on also the neckline is flattering and sexy without showing anything definitely can wear a normal bra
this dress is so much prettier in person  the pattern is unique adorable and not overpowering im an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats  i think this is versatile enough to wear to work party or a casual wedding the fit is perfect  hugs at the correct spots the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely overall  i love it
the movement in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some yeah i can wear these attitude not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is thick enough to hide flaws i am   lbs and i ordered the  i am usually a  the size  fits perfectly i ordered the apricot color great neutral im so happy i was able to get a pair theres a reason most sizes are sold out i have short legs and my legs are medium in size i worried about the thigh
these are just as cute as pictured they are generously sized made from soft denim the denim has quite a bit of stretch i ordered a size down from my normal size i was surprised by all the extra threads in the pockets they were still attached to the inside of the pockets it just made them feel a little unfinished these didnt impact the overall wear or appearance of the garment the straps are adjustable with two buttons on the overalls and three straplength adjustments on the straps the
let me just say the ski pattern is the cutest thing ive ever seen i literally bought it as soon as a saw it i got a size  im usually a  or  in most blouses and shirts but i wanted this to be a litter looser so i sized up its definitely not oversized even though i sized up the fit is a little boxy and a little shorter in the front  really flattering in my opinion the material is really nice and it can definitely be dressed up for work or dressed down with jeans and a chunky scarf
i am partial to maeve tops i love the prints i loved the ski print as soon as i spotted it i think its such a darling shirt for winter the material is light weight which is perfect for layering im planning on wearing it with my fur vest as well as a knit vest i got at retailer last summer i got a  i go between  and  because i prefer some room in button down shirts and it fits as planned i wanted to wait for it to go on sale but i was worried about selling out so i picked up on black f
as another reviewer mentioned maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent i ordered a  and while it fits i think a  would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders and im a thin build the length on this was also a little weird to mea little swingyflared but also short making me feel like id always be playing with it while wearing the orange print is absolutely adorable i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don

i am submitting this review because there were size issues mentioned in some reviews i generally wear a size  but often size up to a  because im a d cup i purchased an  in this because of reviews saying it was small trying it on  the  is fine but it does tent out a lot at the bottom i think i may have been fine with the  because of that it seems a little big from the back view

i usually wear a  in maeve and purchased this is a  in the orange im just over   size  jeans through the bust and arms the  fits great i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable it hangs well though if not a bit loose definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist the length wouldnt be an issue and it isnt even that much of an issue but i did knock off a star for that reason i bo
tried this on in the store in a small im a size  in most retailer dresses and it was enormous im short  so i knew id need a petite size ordered a petite small and the length is better  still a lot of fabric but i think a petite xs would be too small if you are curvier up top im a full  and the petite small is just slightly tight in the bust definitely size down in this or youll be swimming in it
i loved this top so much i ended up getting it in three colors its comfortable and so easy to wear it does run large though in my opinion i normally wear a  in tops and i bought this is a 
"i had been looking for something like this to add to my summer wardrobe fortunately for me i saw these in the retailer catalog and thought how perfect exactly what ive been searching for they are a bit pricey and crotch hangs a bit lower on me because im only  but its not enough to make me send them back i will have them altered if need be they are to cute im a size  in pants and ordered the  i wanted some wiggle room i didnt realize the denim has stretch i will keep the"
these are worth the money gorgeous fit soft denim and make my body look long and sleek especially my bottom i wear mine w a white tee underneath and plan to add booties for the fall but for now platform clogs fabulous
i think this romper is super stylish kind of dvfish and its aspictured except its more colorful in person the vines are pink and pale aqua and the flowers are deeper yellows with white  beige parts and pink dots in them i see what other reviewers mean that the fabric is thin it is but i wouldnt say sheer its a lightweight woven fabric the problem is theres no stretch so when you reach up the whole romper hikes up i think its truetosize i got my usual xspetite and it fits g

great shirt i bought the red penguins and its adorable i am returning it however bc the size i bought was too big with that said it was my error not the brand i think it runs true to size
i saw this and was hoping to try it so i went to the closest retailer the design of this dress is fantastic but if you have curvy hips this is going to cause you problems i am  i have a definite curve between my waist and hips and it totally interfered with the line of the dress i think if you are straighter between your waist and hips or you are long waisted then this lovely dress is for you the waist line was simply too long i needed the dress to flare out higher the to
i did not find this blouse to be tight in the arms or chest im a  though so maybe that is why i also dont have a problem with it being too short in front i took my usual size  i like the feel of the fabric and the prints are great the only thing i slightly dislike is the flowy bottom of the shirt i wish it was more fitted and that is why i took one star off i got the cat print the cat faces are white and on random faces there are pink ears or a pink noseor a winking eye  just a
i knew going in that it may not fit a d cup but the fabric is beautiful so i thought id give it a try i wear a  and bought a large its got a clasp in the back so theres no adjustment on how it fits around which for me was too big the triangles did not provide enough coverage left too much side boob the fabric was very pretty in person but thinner than i expected which also made it seem less sturdy sadly have to return and cancel the backordered bottoms i would recommend to someone
this blouse ran so short in the body it has to go back it would not cover my stomach untucked or tucked in its unfortunate i think it would be very beautiful and flowey
i liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price i thought it was only average
"i am somewhat of a perennial saleonly retailer purchaser often even when a promo code i dont buy full price lol when i saw this top i decided it was worth it i got the penguin print  my  squealed when she saw me pull it out of the box thanks retailer for your woodlandinspired prints that enamor my little onemaeve tends to run big so i went with the  in my opinion it fits true to size i probably would have liked it just a little bigger maybe the  would have been bes"
i love these so very much by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull offbut very tastefully do i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve tshirt worth every penny if your size is available grab themyou will be happy you did

"i had my eye on the skier blouse for awhile before i gave in to the purchase love it for fit and graphics  those happy little skiers i think many reviewers here dont realize this blouse has the cut of a swing style its not meant to be tailored for tucking in if you want to tuck it youll be wearing a highwaisted skirt or pant cute also rayon fabric is a good choice for the style being heavier than cotton and having a better drape over the chest the sloping longer hemline toward the"
i purchased the gray motif with the bright flower design i have owned many blouses in my lifetime but i must say this is one of the best fitting and most attractive of most any i have ever owned it falls just right on my body and is smooth and luxurious with a silky feel the cuffs fall on my wrists just perfectly the color is just right for my fair skin and light hair this was my first order from you and if this is any indication of the quality and fit i will receive ill do a lot more ord
i am in love with this top it is so feminine and cute i wear it with skinny jeans and tall boots and feel so pretty i got the cream color i wish there were more solid colors i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered and i love how it fits i like flowy tops so it is perfect please make solid colors
very cute top just as pictured nice soft material color is bright and true to size wore it to work today on casual friday and received many compliments highly recommend
i ordered the purple in size xl the fit on me matches the model so i think its true to size i wouldnt say theres much purple to this print i cant really find any the areas where the bluered overlap just look navy the photos show how it really looks its a great mix of light brown peach white red and different shades of blue there will be variations because of pattern placement i love this styleits very comfortable
i was really looking forward to getting this top but what a disappointment it is absolutely huge i normally wear a large and i think a small would have fit me and a small never fits me too bad cause its such a pretty top ps this has an attached camis which i hate
i stumbled upon this as a return to our store at first i was a little put off by the change in stitching to add support and shape but once you put it on its perfect its very flattering and very comfortable there are snaps in the crotch but i wore it for a full day  hours and had no discomfort if there were more colors id buy them all lol
pretty design but when i tried it on the fabric was thin and delicate i dont think it would last long with much wear too bad if the fabric were sturdier itd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets
im a tunic lover so ill usually take a chance on them im  and usu a size  or medium i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized its more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse thats really the best way to sum it up oversized swimsuit coverup like top im going to exchange it for an xs but i think even thats too large
i got the purple motif and loved the colors and the feel of the fabric i am  and   the small was too big and there were no xs or xxs
this dress is extremely comfortable and flattering it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress i would recommend wearing it with leggings  as shown with the model or black tights the fit is true to size i am  and the length is a liittle low
i loved the look and feel of this tunic the fabric is soft it has pockets i felt like it ran a little small in the bust im a  and rather than my usual size medium i took a large in this i took off one star because when it was shipped to me the shoulder was coming apart i will have a tailor fix it because i do plan to keep it
good job retailer for getting the color representation spot on the blue is so vibrant and the cashmere knit is so soft and comfortable the dress is oversized but a little too much so i recommend sizing down to get that ideal slouchy drape otherwise you may overwhelm your frame with too much fabric
this top is really cute but it runs very large i am   lbs and the xs petite looked like it was  sizes too big on the design is really cute but recommend ordering down at least one size
while there is nothing wrong with this top it didnt really have an retailer feel it looked more like something from a dept store maybe a boutique i got on sale but sending back bc i just dont like it that much especially next to my pale skin i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone im usually a  med small in this top fit well
i ordered this blouse after it went on sale  im not typically the blousey type but i thought id try it for me and im a pretty consistent small across brands it was quite flowing and a little long but that may be what someone wants it was a little light in color to look good on me but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans  easy to dress up or down 
i was attracted to this sweater because of the pretty fur collar and the color which is a grayblack that seems to go with everything the cut is aline so it drapes over what you are wearing underneath since the fabric is soft it doesnt add a lot of bulk and keeps the fit flattering even though it is not fitted i have worn it many times since purchasing because the color and fit make it easy to throw on over your outfit for some additional warmth personally i found that it runs very large
i ordered a size xl in the mango the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think its truetosize it looks like its intended to have a loose flowier fit throughout the dress the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being   and im under   yet the length is the same it fits me at kneelength too i thought it would hit a little longer based on the models info for the photos and getting the regular sizing the one thing i wish was different is to have it
i ordered the petite in my size since im well petite but curvy i recommend this dress if you dont have a lot of boobage unfortunately for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it it fits but just is not flattering because of my boobs this is always my problem though with dresses
this skirt is absolutely beautiful the design and organza are so feminine and i love the length it flows beautifully and it isnt stiff or anything but it does hold its shape well i ordered it through the store and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days i think it would be easy to snag the material so i will be really careful when im wearing it the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu
"i was so disappointed in this top the fabric blend was too thick for summer the cut was wide across the shoulders and very narrow and short through the waist add in the odd splashes in the print and it spelled disastersize i tend to run between small and xs i ordered xs im  tall  lbs   narrow across shoulders with short arms and long torsofit the cut was so wide across my narrow shoulders that it looked baggy and felt odd however the sleeves didnt sl"
this is a unique color and a lovely dress i have the yellow and i didnt find that it ran large it definitely has a loose flowing fit and you can wear with or without a belt for different looks the pleated fabric near the waist does fit differently than the other fabrics but i dont think it looks odd you have several pictures of people wearing them and you can see that it looks amazing on everyone
i just received this in the mail today and havent taken it off since i feel like i should be in a romantic movie with a cute black dress under it can definitely see myself getting a lot of use out of it can not wait to wear it for the holidays
beautiful and classy i love this im  and my usual xs works great could probably also have worn a s i was a little worried itd be scratchy andor too structured but its soft and flattering photos are accurate would definitely recommend
ill admit that i often believe you pay for the design aesthetics at retailer but not necessarily the quality however this dress happily has both the fabrication and lacework on this dress are beautifully made and the price tag fits i do think the sizing is off im    and the medium my usual size was huge small was still gaping under the arms and xs fit perfectly i havent worn an xs in anything since middle school ha the banding at the bust does make it tight so i can we
this is so soft and has wonderful drape i want to love it it is not gold not in my opinion anyway the gold parts look like muted lime green to me its true to size and looks similar to the picture otherwise i just dont know about that color especially on me
i took everyones advice and purchased a size small instead if medium  i wish i had gotten my usual size as the neckline and bodice is very tight  im top heavy with a wide rib cage and    other than that the skirt of this mango hued beauty is large loose and flowing which i can see why people suggest sizing down  i think my fit problem would be solved if petite was available

this sweater coat is so cute i agree with the other reviews it does run a little big i always wear s tops from retailerwas a little hesitant to order this in a s since i would be wearing it over thingsso glad i did the small is perfect so i would say it runs a little large i do think it is is a little over priced but i did get it at  off and it was a treat for myself
as stated in my review title theyre amazing theyre incredibly well made have just the right amount of stretch and are so flattering i think the boot cut makes them look like pants rather than leggings they can definitively be worn to work or at least where i work where the dress code is business casual my only issue is the length which being at  isnt surprising theyre about  inches too long im a size  and got the large i couldnt recommend these enough

"i dont understand the negative reviewon this sweater it is nothing short of stunning the quality and design are absolutely beautiful and i love the lined pockets i can honestly say i dont think ill ever part with it  this is a sweater you hang onto forever i will say it runs a bit large i ordered the xssm and if i didnt know better i would think its ml either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online do it it is worth every penny especially for the s"

this top is great and perfect for fallwinter ive gotten a lot of wear out of this so fargreat with jeans and sneakers for a casual look or dress it up with black jeans and boots great layering piece as well the fabric is soft and comfortable the fit is nice and relaxed but tailored on the sides to give you some shape the colors are beautifulgreat buy i highly recommend
picked this up end of season sale but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it it runs a bit large im usually between a s and m at retailer and im a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose its definitely not a soft flowy t mix of tshirt material and linen the main part of the t is cotto
i love the color and design of this suit however the rise is too high on my derriã¨re and was not appealing on myself i am   lbs with a very small bust and a short waist i think the suit runs very small as i am a size xss in most of retailers clothing i would recommend it to young lady with a very small derriere and is more petite

this top is cute but i found issues with both the fit and the quality i tried on an xs but found it to be boxy on my petite frame   lbs  even worse though was the feel of this shirt its not lined so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin it was so itchy and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room its a pretty shirt but not worth actually wearing

i love the idea of this shirt the embroidered pattern is fun and summery the fit of the shirt is a little strange i saw that in other reviews but i had to see for myself it is rather boxy i think i may keep it though i will look cute with super fitted skinny jeans to balance out the boxiness of the top

i have this shirt in more than one color i totally disagree with the first review i find this shirt to be super comfy and unique i personally feel the material isnt scratchy at all also i love this designer they are one of my new favorites
the stitched pattern on this shirt is so pretty it fits loosely and looks good with a slimmer bottom it is a little bit itchy but i didnt feel i needed to wear something underneath
"i waited in anticipation for the turquoise version to appear online turquoise and red can be found on another product page with the same name size im between small and xs for most retailer brands i wanted this top to be a bit more fitted so i ordered an xs im   tall  lbs   with long torso and narrow shouldersfit xs is spot on for me i dont really mind the shorter length it didnt appear to be too boxy i layered a white shapewear tank underneath to help w"
this is such a clean and cute printed dress and i knew that i had to try the dress when i first saw it online after reading other reviews i sized up i am normally a  or  in retailer i ordered the  and it fits nicely and looks great however i feel like the  buttons at the lowered rib cage area gape slightly the tie covers it and holds it in place unless i sit then it gapes freely i am a  a so not big chested at all and yet this fit snug in the chest area i would worry about
just bought this at the store just to be safe i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size that was a good idea  i am a   and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest when directly compared to the medium it seems the major difference is the length the large was   longer than the medium i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok
this top is really cute but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin
i wanted to give this top some love i ordered this top and the kota peasant top with plans to only keep one of them this top is definitely the winner the neckline sleeves pattern fabric and length are gorgeous and flattering it is very feminine and elegant and i think it will also be versatileit could be very dressy depending on what you wear it with but it will also look great with jeans and shorts and sandals it is a bit sheer so a tank or cami might be needed underneath i orde
"this maeve dress caught my eye for its unique styling and did not disappoint in person vneckline is deep but not revealing there is a nice hemstitch detail on the sleeve trim the pattern is a good scale for a strong framewhat surprised me  the dress is actually black with light brown flowers on my screen it looked brown with bronze flowers  there are pockets in this unlined dress they are placed onseam but feel weirdly awkward to access almost as if they are set back they"
i bought both black and white shirt white is see through completely black is ok but the material is still too thin i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash not worth the money i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap
its a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester slightly scratchy feel sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat
love this little throw on and feel comfortable all day tee shirt
this shirt fits great it is a fun look i wore it wear a pair of leggings and sneakers for a casual day look it goes down to my knees in the back and the front is asymmetric so cute i think i will get a lot of use out of this going forward
loved the print on this dress however the fit wasnt for me  i feel like it exaggerated my belly and just overall i didnt feel great in it  the sleeves were also really big

what a dress the print the feel of the fabric and the overall fit of this dress it definitely has the wow factor i plan on wearing this dress to the kentucky oaks this year i typically wear a  and sometimes a  in retailer dresses im   lbs  and took a  in this i could probably even try the  it fit a bit tight in the bodice for me but im not sure if it warranted a size up it is pricey but i see this being a closet staple and one of my favorite maxis yet
the quality is good as is the design idea but practically it doesnt work ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly this top is not soft or flowy it is stiff and very wide
i love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress unfortunately the fit was just bad the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets dont think another size or tailoring would address the issue for size i am   and ordered the 
this is a really pretty top the beadingrivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle not stiff the top is kind of like a swing top there is a lot of fabric but it is just right the fabric looks rich and lovely great top
this top is really beautiful the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a ml and it was just too big i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if id been able to snag a smaller size but the ml looked like a teal sack so its going back

this was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the drivers seat in my car  there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and in fact recommends dry cleaning really and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye dont think so after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat i washed the top in a
i just got this in xss at my store and i love it i have a petite frame    lbs so its much longer on me than on the models and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than whats shown in retailers pics so that may vary a bit however the back of mine looks exactly like whats shown above i love the drape and the way it falls on me super casualchic in my opinion id say the color is deep teal wish it wasnt hand wash but sometimes thats worth it
this is the ideal easybreezy sweater to throw over leggings when you just feel like being comfy cozy but still stylish i love it
grabbed this top because i loved the color and to my surprise i loved the style too it is longer on me than the model and im  and it looks great with a long pendant necklace and white skinny jeans i also wear a white tank underneath just in case otherwise i think id be showing some skin i like that the front and back are two different materials
"this tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts jeans work well too and during cooler seasons i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warmthe fit of this top is not true to size for it runs large but is flattering on the body nonetheless the stripes and miniature circular openings i noticed add beautiful detail for formal or informal eventsas a whole this shirt is perfect the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material"
i bought the ml  and love the way it hangs and the length and the fact that it can be worn over a lightweight top the color and feel of the fabric are very nice
what a great shirt however none of the ones i saw in store are colored like the picture the front of them are all a deep blue color no tiedyed effect or whatever youre seeing on the online pics the shirt runs large i am an   and the smaller size was plenty big i cant imagine how the larger size would have looked i think this top will go with many things including as a cover up over dresses
i took a leap and ordered this top in both colors my style is bohemian and flowy so i knew this fit the bill i purposely bought these blouses because i read the reviews and being a  i knew i needed then to run on the larger side i love both colorways equally but that said the blue and yellow pattern runs a whole size smaller than the brown patterned blouse the fit and fabric even feel different the blue and yellow is thicker and less flowy and fits exactly to my body instead of bei
very attractive and well fitting absolutely recommend it
i didnt expect the fit to be as cute i am not sure i like how the model is wearing this top but untucked or more tucked both look more falttering on the color is more vibrant in person still light turquoise but richer i dont think i nbeed petite in this as it is blousy but not oversized or boxy
this is a cute sweater that can be very versatile i love to wear it to work with a dress pant as well as with jeans on the weekends it is soft and looks great on would recommend
"i immediately loved the rich royal blue color of this sweater with its pretty flower nice fabric and medium weight nice warm sweateri have an retailer skirt just like the photo great outfit i am happy i ordered it but hope it shrinks after washingthe small is very big and boxy sleeves long i am  medium build small usually fits me welli recommend downsizing or you will probably take this back"
i love this dress so muchwhat an excellent purchase i wear this with white leggins and love the look this dress has a sheath underneath the flower pattern that is form fitting which i think is way sexy from the back the front part of the dress is very flowy and moves nicely i love the high neck on this piece and the beautiful colors a wonderful pick up from retailer
i love this top i originally bought the brownpurple pattern and wore it all the time so when i saw the blue and yellow on sale i had to get it the fabric is really soft and breezy  perfect for the spring to summer weather the sleeves are a little long on me but doesnt bother me it runs a little large but works with my style i would have sized down but it wouldnt have fit in the bust im a  i definitely recommend this top
the dress i received has a blue lining under the patterned chiffon unlike the white lining that is pictured the back of the dress is more open than it appears in the pictures so the blue lining and the large exposed zipper is a significant portion of the dress design also the arm holes are cut short which makes the dress feel awkward on the quality of the dress is very high
i bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer doesnt come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue the arm holes seem to be on the larger side im  so it is not this short on me im really happy with this purchase plus it has pockets
wanted to love these pants they are way way too long im   for reference i didnt love the way they looked cuff and didnt think it was worth having them hemmed loved the color would work well for someone tall and slim
these are such a great fall staple the silver color is the perfect greyolive and the texture is perfect doesnt feel like there is extra material like most cords and they hold their shape throughout the day the fit is just perfect i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly
this is probably the softest most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully great for spring  summer love it as a coverall at the beach my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me highly recommend
i just received the pink in the mail i am   and around  i ordered the size  they fit perfectly they are a very straight leg with a snug fit you can adjust the cuff to whatever length you need or unroll them completely the fabric is of beautiful quality i basically never wear corduroy because it can add pounds not so with this pair of pants i am thinking about another color
this dress is a zillion times cuter in real life its very retroswingy and girlish it reminds me of something mia farrow wouldve worn in her rosemarys baby era i have the black version and ive paired mine with tall black gladiator sandals for a more sultry nighttime look and also flip flops for beachy summer days i think its a total steal at the sale price
these pants are a really pretty color and feel nice on the fit was great and did not really shrink with washing i received a lot of compliments the first time i wore them
this is a cute top but not worth the price in my opinion i love the colors pattern and soft material used however the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying 
i bought two pair in one weekcrazy right i am  and  i bought the pink color soft faded pink which drew me to them right awaykinda soft and romantic pink then two days later went back one hour drive and bought the silver which is really a worn in green color i feel these are true to size i wouldnt size down because these aret super stretchyfeels like it also wont bag out during the day i really love these cordsand the rolled up cuff is adorable
"these flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeansi loved the higher rise because they dont feel like theyre will fall off like many low cut jeans dothe material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever ownedlove the braided styling around the pocketsthe bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok"
i love this dress it is loose fitting so be prepared for that i ordered an xs i believe the dress was intended to fit this way though and i do not think it looks too big on me i typically wear a  or  in dresses this would be a great dress to wear if you were planning on eating a big meal ha i cant wait to wear this dress in the summer and believe i will wear it often it has more of a boho look to it i do think it could be worn with heels though i will probably wear it with flat gol

i love this dress and on sale its a total steal its true to size and beyond comfortable i live in az so i can easily wear this year round i got the black color and love it im  and it hits a little above my knees love the loose feminine swing i feel like skipping wearing this dress 
this pair of flare is just what i have been searching for the color is a nice vintage blue i love the fit of the flare however please keep in mind these do run long and larger that size
i ordered this skirt because the  i tried on in store was huge and the  was way too small the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another  the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas i like the concept of the design with the button front and aline princess seams in the front and back but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch i returned it
this poncho is lovely i found it fits perfectly im   and got the xssjust long enough loke jacket length and the hood doesnt add extra weight doesnt drag it down the back arm holes are approriate size very cool piece for any weather layering
the appliquã© on this dress is well done i would recommend it to anyone the design is super flattering and feminine
cute suit over all cups are lightly padded which is nice if youre concerned about modesty it runs really small in my opinion i am  and  lbs i almost always wear a size small but i ordered a medium in this suit and although it fits and im sticking with the medium im wondering if a large might fit even better its also too tight on the leg openings in my opinion i like that the straps are adjustable the pattern is flattering and i like the suit well enough to keep it but i

i ordered the lavender version in xl it fit me as shown on the model so i think it runs true to size it is a little shorter than shown it hits my waist  im  ft   in for reference it fits close through the arms  body but with a comfortable stretchy material a tank underneath is needed i love the draping its very flattering the color is more of a gray than purple i took the chance on it when it was on sale and its now a favorite great neckline for wearing necklaces too
i loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge maybe if you size down it would be better xs was not available for me to try also the lavender color is really washed out
this pants are very comfortable and add a little flare to my typical mom pajama look i found them true to size size small fit my   frame comfortable to sleep and lounge in
ive been wanting a higherwaisted buttonfront skirt this one was perfect because of the texture on the denim it makes it dressy enough to wear to work if you are in a businesscasual setting i think it has a ton of versatility for multiple seasons im normally a  or  in dresses   lbs and i ordered a  in the skirt as the natural waist is a little on the large side i love it
i agree with the other reviewer the colors were fabulous but it was boxy and fit me like a sack the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits it was really a cute idea and im sad it didnt work i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chancei should have listened 
i have been looking for a skirt like this and love this one it does sit a little high on your waist but i like that and think its more flattering at least on me it is i marked that it runs try to size but may run a tiny bit on the larger size i usually wear a  but a  fit great and its been a long time since ive worn a 
i got the purple and its a lovely muted purple almost lavender nice quality flattering i recently had a baby so this is a nice shirt to hide my wobbly bits id recommend to anyone with or without wobbly bits
this dress is adorable i plan on wearing it as maid of honor in my sisters wedding next year i am in between a size  and  usually go with  because im a bit busty and have some hips but since i got it after it was put on clearance only a size  was availableit turned out to be a perfect fit literally i tried it on braless if i had any sort of padded bra then i would have trouble fitting in the top section which worked out perfectly since the arm holes are a bit low  i think it
this skirt was placed next to the gallery skirt corduroy skirt and i thought it was the same until i touched the fabric and realized it was denim the material is not the average stiff jean type but much thinner cotton material i am surprised that this skirt is now released because i feel that it should have belonged to the summer collection i think it is a nice basic casual skirt if you need one kudos for the unique buttons the first button is decorative which stands out from the rest of

great fabric and design beautiful pattern with flattering angled bottom hem and fringe so soft and comfortable  the hood is cuter left down perfect transitional piece for fall  i got the neutral color and it is so easy to wear  im  and got the sxs size and feel that it is still wearable  i second the opinion one reviewer mentioned about wearing a belt through the slit over the front part definitely works well and makes for an effortlessly stylish look

"love the clean lines the texture and the slight sheen on this skirt which does run a bit large in the waist the online photos are very true to what the fabric looks like it is a stiffer but lightweight fabric so the skirt stands away from the body the quality of the finish is excellent and i really appreciate the hidden zipper and pocketsfit runs large in the waist the size  i have measures  on the top inside of the waistband and i think the model is wearing a size too loose oth"
"great little summer jacket that takes the place of a jean jacket  i am not usually fond of olive green but this is a bit deeper than a drab olive without being too green it is sooo soft and comfortable that i find i am pairing it with all sorts of outfits fits tts if you are going for the look on the model not too fittedi highly recommend this timeless piece"
this dress is made well the constructionsewing details give the dress a beautiful shape it has a nice zipper at the back and fabric feels light pockets are a good size skirt flows but doesnt feel heavy fit is comfortable i typically wear somewhere between a size  i ordered a  and it fits just right im  and it falls below my kneelength is nice armholes are a bit lower than i thought but not too low its a classicmodern look it was sold out when i first wanted to buy it
this jacket is so great ive gone through a few seasons now trying to find that one perfect little olive green jacket this one wins the color is nice and saturated the fabric is soft and drapey so its still flattering to my shape its slightly relaxed and i think it creates an easy look ive already worn this with a dress and it will finish off many other looks in my closet yea im   lbs and took a medium
this is a great dress that i wear to work but would also wear to a cocktail party or wedding it rides up a tiny but but is long enough that i feel completely comfortable it is tiny up top so id recommend ordering up if you have any chest  im   bra size  and it was a twoperson job to get the bodice zipped

i have a hard time finding slacks that are a step up from jeans and that is why these are such a great find they feel great fit well the price was good even before i got them on sale i love the color and they seem like they will be easy to take care of wish they came in more colors
i absolutely love this dress i purchased it in my usual size  petite and it looks as though it was made for me the combination of the placement of the pattern and the cut of the dress was quite figure flattering the only tiny issues i had were that the dress fell to the middle of my kneecaps and may need a hem in addition the dress takes a bit of maneuvering to get into due to the side zipper and the close fit despite these issues i feel that it is definitely worth buying and i will be k
love this shirt and the print i would wear it all the time if socially acceptable ive only worn it once but have already gotten so many compliments there are hints of neon in the coloring that cant really be seen in the pictures i saw it in store and fell in love and then decided to splurge when i saw it online and couldnt think of life without it
"this is a cute t with colors that blend with so many things i already have in my closetand i love the western theme which isnt at all girly usually i purchase vneck items becausethey suit me best but i couldnt pass up the idea of cactus and succulents it will be a funshirt to wear"
loved the printpattern and the light greyi think it might have been better if reversed it has a v in the back and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me im normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me wish it could have worked but returning it
"i didnt receive a jacket i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it jackets have some structure to them for example they might nip in at the waist a bit this cardigan doesnt do that it hangs in a very boxy shape the quality is great very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details but i dont needwant another cardigan im   lbs and got a small the small seemed big but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st"
this blouse is stunning i have been wanting it for some time i finally broke down and purchased it i am   and about  i generally wear size l size  i bought this in a large i need a medium for sure i could get away with the large but its very flowy i think the med will be more flattering i am planning to exchange for a smaller size i would recommend this blouse for sure if you want it buy it its often times sold out

this dress is of great quality and design the lines and the way the dress shapes your body are perfect throughout the entire dress i am short and it is a little long on me it is between my calf and my ankle but the way it flatters in the bust and waist more than makes up for it with the right shoes it is a real winner i think this dress would be flattering on every body type highly recommend

i really wanted this to work the embroidery detail is very pretty however the inside of the sweatshirt is a bit scratchy from the embroidery so i would recommend wearing a cami or tank the sweatshirt is also on the short size the small hit the top of my jean waist in the end i decided to return it
i just got this top today the print is just as beautiful in person as it is on the web it is so incredibly soft and comfortable i tried it on and it fits just like the photo i am  so i can get away with the blousy effect but i think that is part of why it is so charming i think you could dress it up or down really well i am really pleased

this is a great lightweight jacket i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear im an antipant person the only downside is the price its a nice stylish jacket but not sure it warrants the high price tag it also doesnt look to great buttoned up has to be worn open i do recommend it though
"i honestly liked this little cardigan it is a misnomer as a jacket it really is more of a light sweatercardigan but i didnt have any negative issues like others on herepros great feel on the skin and fabric this really caught my attention hard to find a sweater thats breathable for cool summer evenings or mornings color scheme will go with anything elegant touch unlined making it breathable runs large forgiving it stretchy im normally a size  ml"
ok you had me at the western scene soft and comfortable true to size you can dress it up or down just a great t shirt recommend it get it
love this top the material is light soft and comfortable one thing to note it runs very large this feature is perfect for me as i was worried it would be too tight around the middlethis style would not look good if it didnt fit looseso i was pleasantly surprised to see that it fit me with plenty of roomsomething i need for my full figure if you are trim around the middle i recommend going down a size or two
im surprised this worked for so many people for me this dress fit terribly however the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made i am  and about  with a really short torso and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have i think the bodice was just too long for me the neckline was also too low on someone taller or maybe with a longer torso i could see this dress being really lovely
cozy soft comfortable a perfect transitional top that bubbles over with personalityits a unique fabric design that makes you feel like youre on vacation love it
i loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it however sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs im   lb and a bra size  c i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug in the end i still didnt like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both the material is great quality and its a cute design i would recommend trying t
yay for the return of shirts that show your form but dont reveal the flaws i bought this in cream which only seems to be in stores right now the stripes on the cream version are vibrant and beautiful the weight of the top is very nice and really hugs your shape i did think it ran a tad small i bought the large but also could have worn the medium
i loved this jacket its exactly what i was looking for i set out to find a lightweight sweater or jacket that would keep me warm and also versatile enough to wear with different outfits this definitely fit the bill in addition its really soft and not at all itchy which was a concern i had since it was wool and i ordered it online i have received a bunch of compliments i definitely recommend it
"this top comes in  lovely colors too bad only one of htem looks decent on my skin tone purple though i might have gotten away with the silvery greyfit nice falttering line flares at the bottom and is loose aroun d the waist so if you ahve a problem area nice coveragefeel super soft  nuff said versatility i am not sure it will look great with everything on my body type but definitly a nice pair of jeans flare or skinny with bootsa and may try the pencil skirt look like the"
this sweater is very pretty the pictures online do not show the intricate knitting and the lovely details or how delicate the yarn is i bought the light orange color and i think it will transition nicely into spring the shape is very figure flattering as well overall i am very happy with my purchase
"i was on the lookout for a denim jacket when i found this beauty on line i fell in love immediately and didnt think twice about paying full price i wear it with moss green chinos and it looks really good the little dots in the jacket are actually a pale green which gives it extra character very well made i was a bit skeptical about the hook and eye fastenings but they are very secure i ordered my usual xl and found it roomy enough in the bust and arms i would definitely call it tru"
" if you look at the  photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back this shirt is attached in not one but two places in the back in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached or knotted in one place and that is not the case disappointing  unless you want to wear this as an offtheshoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down caveat sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle"

for years ive eyed these printed pilcro cord leggings every single year in every single incredibly cool print  ive always wanted them finally i decided to try them on after we got this green and navy print and im so glad i did these are dreamy they are so stretchy and so comfortable they hold snug against your leg for a very streamlined fit but plenty of stretch so movement is no issue the print is my favorite part the colors are extremely fun but still classy enough to not feel to
i saw the orangetangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it it looked beautiful on top the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail sadly the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant i weigh  i am petite and small boned i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me i wish i could look good in this it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture
"i am obsessed with the off the shoulder trend this season i were mind on the shoulders so its work appropriate and you can still tuck it in the length is perfect the colors are awesome t paired it with a pair of pilco cords it easily work with a skirt or dress pantsi would highly recommend"

i didnt end up keeping this and i feel like i might regret it  i have a similar sweater this jacket is super streamlined with a sleek fit the bummer for me was that it didnt have snaps to hold the collar down to the jacket when it was unzipped so the flaps seemed to flop around the s was perfect not too tight im   lbs 
i found this instore when looking for a dressy slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding im really happy with it  the aline cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it doesnt feel like im hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted the flowy hemline offsets the short length maybe  above the knee for me the pink color is very light  lighter than in the photos i think  but it will work nicely for the wedding as the first reviewer sai

this dress is lovely feels like a dreamso comfortable and the lining is silky soft i feel it runs a little large as maeve has been this springsummer as i ordered a  and   fit i am  about  i ordered the white hoping to take it on a beach vacation it was just a little too delicate for my needsi have two younger children it seemed to be easy to snag or to make a hole in the more delicate woven areas of the dress otherwise i really liked this dress a lot too bad
when this dressed first debuted i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters add a wide leather belt when its opened or closed works great either way when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum i knew this would be an ideal pair
this is a wonderful dress i love the fit and feel of the fabric i have been looking for a while for a fall maxi to wear with a pair of free people boots i purchased this dress is perfect with them the colors are fall and fresh can i say that about fall
i feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee its a lovely pattern and i like the fit its not clingy but its a bit seethough its not as bad as the other tee but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt unless thats your thing that said im happy with it because its a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather i am very glad i got it on sale though i wouldnt have paid full price for it
"i knew this jacket would be mine as soon as i saw it online but i also have a hard time trusting retailers online photos by their color and angle etc i took a gamble and for the most part it paid off i do like the jackets unique bohemian gone chicuptown styling and the gorgeous patten with a spattering of embroidery on the chest and back what i dont like is the mix of black leather trim and big brass studs i feel like there might be one too many ideas or they could have been toned"
i wish i would have read the other reviews before ordering its cute but very casual and very thin materialnot like other retailer tops also runs super small i ordered a small i wear a small or xsmall at retailer and will likely jump to a large given feedback in other reviews
i ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering i am tall  about  pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape if you like a loose fit this might be for you the material is thicker and warm and comfortable i would suggest ordering down a size
i tried the pink color on in the fall and liked it but wasnt sure how much id wear it for the price i ordered down a size in the maize for the holidays when it went on sale i think i prefered the subtlety of the pinkblush color the maize is a goldenrod yellow not as light a shade as it looks in the online picture ill still keep it because it is super comfy though the sequins dont show as well as on the blush it will look cute with leggings and boots or high heels i didnt find it to
love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked material is soft cute design but not flattering returning
just beautiful the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way the fit is really comfortable tooi found that the jacket runs tts maybe even a bit large but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers keep in mind i have a rather large bust so someone with a smaller one could probably size down please note there are no closures in the front of the jacket but it looks almost closed when youre wearing it
"this tshirt is very casual so it is perfect for everyday use touch of textile is comfortable so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this tshirt although stripe is a simple design it does not limit your choise of fashion so it can go with almost anything just be aware that this tshirt runs a little larger than the true size"
this dress was overall cute but you have to have an olivedarker complexion or a nice tan to really pull it off because it is such a pale pink im very fare but normally can do light punks but this one just clashed it does run pretty true to size if youre on the edge between a smaller or bigger size i recommend the smaller size however hope this helps yall
i like this shirt and think its very feminine
this top is true to size although i am a little nervous about washing it hopefully it wont shrink it is super think so great for hot days but because its so thin ill be careful i have white and am def going to get more colors i am   and purchased a small i think medium might cut to low in the v but havent tried it yet lets just say if it shrinks after washing i will get a medium

i bought this top about  weeks ago love it i like it because its better than a plain tshirt so its perfect for running around doing errands or shopping i like the material and the length im  and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short i wash it and hang it to dry no shrinking or pilling so far i am ordering this in at least two more colors
i think  reviews says it all basic tee with a little tailoring on upper back in a variety of colors i purchased the purple floral tee in my local store and it is prettier in person than on the website much more vibrant in color it is tts
"this jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens but in realitymeh i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket to me it all felt more cloying than cleverthe quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable since i"
this duster is a nice light weight dark navy that you can throw on to add a little something to a your outfit without adding bulk or warmth looks nice over dress jeans crops just a fun little item to have in you closet that you can grab to put a little twist to an outfit best part of the dusterit has pockets i love being able to slide my iphone into a pocket while on the go
i love the look and design of this piece but the fit is awkward the m gapes open and is much boxier than it looks on the model but the s is too tight in the elbows i think i might have to return it 
this dress is beautiful and flowy but flattering the colors are vibrant the slip is tighter than the dress but i dont mind it is a half slip and the bottom is sheer im normally a  in dress and the  fit well the length was good for my  height
this jacket is extremely good quality has gorgeous detailing and is warm quilting makes it thicker than expected but plan to wear as both a blazer and fall jacket highly recommend
i tend to like grey black simple clothes with a splash here and there for everyday this will be perfect in the fallwinter it is wool so be prepared for the felted wool feel but it is casual comfortable i am   and boxy the medium is still roomie on me but that is how i like it
i was a little hesitant to order this dress due to the cottonpolyester blendnot generally a fan of poly for summer it is high quality though very soft lightweight and lays beautifully its not see through either which seems like a rare find in clothing lately the embroidery is very well done too and i think it adds just the right touch of feminine while not being overly precious it does run small by a whole size which ive found to be typical of eva franco dresses i am usually a
i have the blue and gray and love the look and feel however the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas
"and flattering i love the feel of the dress it is flowy loose but still flattering i cant wait to wear it with boots i could go with flats for summer too if i wanted to i have had this dress in my wish list then i deleted it but it was in the store as a return in xxs p so i thought why not i shouldnt have really coz now i have to get it and i didcolors are actually great i dont know why people have issues matching  black or navy are equally neutral in my booksf"
this is a fantastic dress its very flowy comfortable stylish and it has pockets whoop whoop i have a larger bust  and even though its button down the openings in between dont peak open to show your bra it is navy and red but i think you could wear black boots with it no problem this is my new favorite dress and im very happy with my purchase buy it
i disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online i received a lot of compliments when i wore it i wore it with black skinny jeans black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket and did not keep on the entire night i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in  i really love it maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change
this shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it no spare buttons included but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it not big enough of an issue to return
no no noi dont know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging or what but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down im  about   usually wear a  or  in dresses this thing barely buttoned over my bust and then flares out to a tentlike triangular shape at the bottom i dont think it would come out by washing and ironing it im afraid it was just cut poorly i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes unfortunately i bought three different dresses in the
absolutely perfect staple top to have in your wardrobe fits very nicely not see through at all highly recommend this top
first im an  and tried the s and m i couldve worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion i kept the small the color i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark the only con the sleeves they stick right out to the sides and dont lay down as much as the online photo it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it material is super light

this top is a great neutral layering piece with some nice visual interest the blackandwhite pattern and tieneck style will add a little something to a cardigan or blazer the neck can also be tied multiple ways its definitely appropriate for work and i found it tts i normally wear a  and took an m in this top
im in love with this skirt i already have so many outfits planned out i do feel it runs slight large maybe half a size im   lbs and usually wear a  i ordered a small and its fairly loose but i like that personally if you want a tighter pencil look then size down
i debated for awhile about getting this dress being tall i was worried that it would be really short on me so i ended up ordering it in a large im  a size  it definitely has a blousey look to it which i like i kind of wish i had ordered it in a medium as well but i think the large will work just fine the length is good hits right above my knee the elastic waistband is nice because i can pull it up around my natural waist or pull it down for more of a drop waist effect as o
i am  and  pounds slender but with a tummy the small fit great and i agree with the other reviewer that the elastic waist band is complimentary the dress flounces out a little but in a cute way and its not too short compared to so many other baby doll dresses out there now i didnt think it looked that great on the hanger but when i tried it on it looked so much better than i expected got the brown thank you to the other reviewers for the bootie boot moto jacket transition to
i ordered these jeans twice because i love them the first pair were mismarked by about  sizes so i reordered second pair still didnt fit they run really small i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet
it is very hard to find a great midi denim skirt pomonas is very stylish well made and looks great on i had to exchange my size  for a size  and am awaiting its arrival remaining hopeful it will provide a better fit first time in my life i have purchased a  so cant say for sure whether the skirt runs small or i am now running larger i recommend this skirt
i wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer but it just didnt work for me it made me feel a bit frumpy honestly i purchased the neutral color maybe the red would have been less grandmotherly something about the elastic waist just didnt work for me either i tried this with boots booties heels clogs flats sandals and i just couldnt make this dress work sadly sending this one back im   lbs and tried the medium
the model in this photo should be standing tall because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper i ordered a small and am   the dress fits like a glove and is a pull over style the nude slip lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel yet nice breezy sexy appeal this dress can be worn to work on a hot date and even a nice weekend look when i say slimming i mean it the center detail grabs the most perf
i feel really cool wearing this skirt  a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform loooks great with short boots im wearing it as i write this reviewand was wearing it all day awesome skirt
i love the cold shoulder trend and this top seemed to satisfy i bought it in the blue which is really more like a very light mint green however i think the material is pretty thin though soft and the keyhole sleeve area right by the twist is not substantial so it looks a little cheap i ordered the small but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs  pounds  its very loose fitting but i wouldnt say it looks bad its just a very relaxed fit for the price thou

i like the idea of this but had to return it the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into the shirt is too poofy didnt flatter short and curvy
ordered this in the neutral motif size large and its a great little dress comfortable and cute but modest enough that im not worried about my bust  hanging out too much the vneck hits at the perfect spot the sleeves are the perfect  length not too tight and its not too short on me  im a light blonde and i dont feel washed out in this it hides a little belly well without being a tent also the lining is super soft and flexible the only problem is the upper back falls
perfect for day at the beach im  and the length is just right above knee not too short fresh and cool cotton comfortable feel
really cute dress  the laceup detail is distinctive and i think this dress will be versatile great for hot weather but i tried it on with retailer skinny pants and that looked cool too the included slip not a lining is soft and not clingy im on the petite size and often find that relaxedfit dresses like this make me look like im wearing a sack but this one is not too billowy or shapeless i tried the mango color on in the store and really wanted to buy it but the color just is not
i agree with the other reviewers about sizing down in this tee the colors are beautiful and design lovely i love how the sleeves are finished and the neckline i purchased at my local retailer store along with the flower days tee that i purchased in a larger size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts highly recommend both
i love this shirt for a throw on and go  hangs nicely and fits great  colors are more vibrant in person  i love mauve i think they do a great job with their designs
i love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it wouldnt plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle  i am a petite  and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste
so happy to say this dress was built for my body type  im heavier  wider in my upper body so the cut of the bodicehalter fits perfectly and comfortably  going in at the waist and flaring out to a soft aline the skirt pleating lays just right since i have no hips or booty  yes the fabric is heavier weight so i wouldnt recommend wearing in hot  humid weather  i love the unique print  colors  i do not own anything in this color combination  the retro vibe is strong in this one so i
i purchased the mango it is flattering with my olive skin and golden brown hair i am keeping it im used to linen so no surprises there i agree with a reviewer that said it will work in summer and fall i could wear this walking on the beach to a summer casual dinner party i plan on wearing gold sandals and gold jewelry this will make the feel more summertime then i will wear boots with it in the fall im very happy with the choice my store didnt have the blue the fit is tts im  f
really pretty blue top great for wearing around the house if you want to be comfy and casual yet look good in case your neighbor shows up at your door of if you have to run a quick errand if your wear it with distressed jeans it will add to the casual vibe the blue is vivid and perfect for any hair color dont get me wrong the top is casual and cute it is not sloppy and has an international worldly vibe i recommend it

"the smallest size xs was big on me i was overwhelmed by the sweater it is a bit of swing shape doesnt hug the body sleeves are interesting though but not flattering on a petite frame color is a pretty green made me think of wintergreens fabric may be itchy to some just ok for mefor reference xs bog on  lbs   in waist"
"i have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pantsi got compliments on all the looks i think its a fun and cheerful feminine summer topi got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is wouldnt have paid full retailrequires ironingi am a size  and  and have a small"
would recommend but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over even the length was more than i expected from the photos online i am   narrow hips usually a  in pants including other level  pants i own i ordered a  and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned plus they went nearly to my ankles anyhow the material is really nice soft and comfy color was good i ordered the dark and i could imagine they would be super cute
i really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges but the first thing that set me off was the color and the material the color is more street sign yellow than a soft warm yellow the fabric is a thin sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper i was anticipating a thicker shirtlike fabric when i tried it on i liked the idea but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costumeor a parachute i will defin

"the pattern is very adorable unfortunately the design is flawed sizing is great at the waist and hip and the length is spot on but the top is wide its strange because i dont think it would fit someone that was bustier than me eitherwill return im considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it"
maybe i wouldve kept this top i love the print colors and design however i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it since my bust and torso seemed too large for it the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good
"the fabric is absolutely lovely on these but very thin the top part was tighter than usual and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size and they flare a lot so the thin tight top was not a flattering look the rise also felt short im   with a  inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on which is never a good reaction  even if i hemmed them i think these are a miss for me will be returningbetter for"
those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture also the material is quite thin which makes the snug part look unflattering they were not for me unfortunately
i really really like this tunic it is gorgeous but it runs small i tried in l usually wear lxl i may need to try the xl but i sent it back because it just too expensive the fabric itself is thick and heavy i didnt like the fabric much i wish it were softer especially for such a gorgeous tunic it was hard to send it back but i may try the larger size in the store i think i need  sizes up it runs too small
great idea but this was not a flattering top on me it almost worked but ended up making me look like i am pregnantnot a look i am striving to achieveit has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success  i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso for the price it did not justify a place in my closet
softest denim  they feel like theyve been through the wash a hundred times already im pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me im  and bought the petite for a perfect fit these will become a goto pair
i love these bottoms they are super cute comfy and very flatering finally a bikini botom i feel comfotable in after having my babies its just high enough to cover my stretch marks on top and the ruffles cover the one down low  and fits loosly enough to avoid a muffin top i am normally between a size  and ten  lbs and i ordered size large
"im really glad i read the previous reviews on this im normally between a  or  thought a  would work best for me seeing that its high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys the  fits very comfortably im  and i can wear them with flats"
"i love it but i dont at the same timesheer so sheer you can probably get away with a nude bra but not sure i tried on both colors and love them both love the shimmer i ordered btoh xxs p and xxs regulari think i would go with regular the petite seemed cropped on me so if i lift my arms hello bellyso overall i would probably get this if it goes on sale color is either way but since i dont have an immediate need i passed nice turtleneck thoughreference "
"i have been waiting for these to go on sale for some time now and so happy to day they still had my sizein both colors i dont usually buy  things the same in different colors but in this case i didfit true to size for me almost had a hard mite buttoning but they are stretchy so dont buy a bigger size they will stretch could not decide which color to keep so kept both i ordered the    i am  and  lbs i think these are vanity sized but my usual vanit"
"i bought these to wear to a christmas party with a lacy blouse but found they were whats been missing in my life after wearing them nearly every other day i decided i needed another pairfeel like yoga pants but look polished make your butt look perky and your legs slim  maybe i need another pair"
saw these at my local retailer store and almost didnt try them on so glad i did they made my legs look long and lean they run a little big and i decided to go down a size because i think they may stretch out after wearing for awhile the material is fairly thick but i think that helped in making them appear to slim my hips butt and thighs the material is really pretty stretchy and that made them so comfortable i love how i look in these

great fit and style the color is perfect for spring they have a nautical feel to them
"i adore these jeans i bought them in a size  but probably could have gone with a  i decided to keep them anyway and have been very pleased the fit is flattering the color is perfect i prefer these gray jeans to any other color for most outfits the waist is a little higher than im used to but that makes the fit even more flattering and helps prevent the sagging out issue that my older paige skinny jeans havei love these jeans and definitely recommend them for hourglass shapes mo"
sits slightly below waist i bought size  length is good no alteration required for petite height  and  material is good and i recommend them
perfect in every way easy to wearvery feminine comfy and goes with everything only problem is color is not like picture it is a mauve not a light pink i still love this top and the color it camre in brighten up with lipstick necklace earrings whatever your pick highly recommend a winner
"this top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased i really love it it is different than i thought it would be i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large definitely recommend"
this blouse does have a flowy boxy shape to it but the details make up for that when i wear it tucked into a skirt it looks wonderfully flattering i tried on an xs and considered looking for a xxs but i feel that size would probably end up being too short instead of more fitted
i wanted to love this top i really did the color is beautiful the embroidery is well done the fabric is soft and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top i think i will try again and order next size down
super flattering dress love it makes my waist look tiny great fit and flare style without making me look pregnant i love the fabric will be great as a travel dress packs easy doesnt need to be ironed really substantial fabric love it i think it runs large since im rarely a  at retailer but i find that maeve runs all over the place im usually a  at retailer and i got a  in this
"i just got these and had to return them as they were not becoming on my physique for reference im   lbs  waist  and i have a long torso and short legs i ordered a  petite the fitwas tight but they are supposed to fit tight if i wasnt so hippy i would have kept them the model isslender with long legs and she looks fantastic in them not me i do recommend these as they are cute but perhaps geared for a more slender body type"
i purchased in the raspberry love this color and the asymmetrical design is super cool and the color is unique  however i am on the fence this knit top is very thin and for the price and to wear in the cold fall and going into winter i think i need it to be more of a light sweater or at least a thicker fabric i am  and  lbs and the small fits perfect the sleeves are long which you tall gals will love
while i love this top  beautiful color and pattern i found it to be a bit short  if it were a few inches longer i would be thrilled  im    curvy and have a long torso so that may be the problem i will say that within  hours of wearing this i had  strangers stop me and comment re how pretty it is i am keeping it 
i ordered my normal size large and it fit well although a bit on the long side the fabric has a waffle texture thats lightweight but warm and cozy i got the blue and the color was a bit intense in combination with the tie dye affect and waffled texture my favorite part are the lighter striations on the neck that opening is really small it just didnt suit me so i returned but recommend giving it a try if its calling your name
i saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store tried it on but didnt have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed noticed it on sale online and had to order it is so comfortable and flattering the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape not slinky at all
the idea of this dress is lovely the fabric is pleasing to the touch the print manages to be eye catching but understated i dont know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly the top fits poorly i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders how
"love the shape and flow of this dress but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going backwould not recommend"
this dress is made of a wonderful thick material that is flattering i think the photo doesnt really bring it to life its a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a  season dress thanks to the colors the vneck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck

the details on this blouse are so pretty it is a bit wide but it flows nicely it is also a little shorter than a lot of tops but i think it will work nicely with higher waisted flares this spring the sleeve is very flattering i got medium my normal size
i love the tiedye look i ordered the blue color in my usual size small fit is tts love it just a fyi  on mine one arm is a darker blue tiedye the other is very light color variation  the white band on the mockneck doesnt give much so be careful when putting ontaking off  i think its pricey but ordered during the promo so that made it better it came yesterday put it on w my washed blue skinny jeans out to dinner we went
i am giving this dress  stars bc its pretty and i bought it but im going to need to get it altered big time i got the  and its too big on top but this is the type of dress that should be fitted on top i am a small person but this fit more like a  or  print is beautiful though wayyy prettier than the pic i suggest getting  sizes down i could see it being extremely gorgeous if it fits correctly
"the photo does not do this top justice the design of this peplum is very slimming and the colors are complimentary to any skin tone i usually wear a m  but purchased the l based on other reviews it fits perfectly would highly recommend"
i love the feel and drape of silk this dress has lovely drape and fantastic color i think if paired with the right sweater and leggings this will work well into the fall and also transition into other seasons if you are savvy the only awkward point about this dress is that you must wear a belt with it if you have an hourglass shape otherwise its a beautiful swing fit

just bought the patterned and gray the small fit perfect i do have a short torso though chest size  i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasnt sure of great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts
"top is blouse and long enough to stay tucked in if you want  like the laser cut detail front and back  sleeveless is great for summer months here  can wear to work or dress down with jeans  fit is true to size  i am  slim and small busted so anything fits me  i would think it youre busty it would be fine as its a blousy fitthe color is more of a salmon pink which works for me  however if your looking for a true pink it may not work"
i ordered this in an  yellow the yellow is more of a rich golden yellow than the easter yellow i see on my monitor that i was hoping itd be but im keeping it because it fits me perfectly i am chesty for my size  and somehow i dont look bigger than i am in this top i also have broad shoulders and this doesnt feel tight when i move my arms bonus that it has loops to keep your bra straps in place i have to dock a star though because there are quite a few fabric threads to trim f
i ordered the coralpeach version in size  it ran small especially compared to other size  or  maeve blouses ive purchased very tight throughout the blouse the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived the material was extremely cheap in quality it wrinkled terribly the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet the idea of this was perfect for my style unfortunately the poor choice in material  poor fit made this a return for me
the only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink which is fine just a tad unexpected i ordered a size  and it fits perfectly  chest the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine unique touch to an otherwise basic top i cant wait to wear it
i was impressed with the textured knit of this piece which looked nicer in person than online and the open neckline with a contrasting stripe i really liked that the whole bodice was lined with a sewnin lining from neck to hem minus the sleeves i would have loved the dress overall but my usual size small was snug at the hips and it would have just made me too selfconscious for that reason sadly i have to return mine but i would certainly recommend the style for someone with slim hips
i didnt love it enough to buy it but did think it was cute i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 
i bought this in blue and love it i usually wear an xs to small in retailer shirts and a small to medium in dresses i ended up with an extra small petite in this it is really flattering and hides the stomach enough i highly recommend the dress if you size way down

went to the chicago michigan ave location and found this gem in the take a peek section i think thats what its called  anyway been looking for a plane white top to wear with a red lace pencil skirt and this fit the bill wore it today with a grey midi skirt and sneakers and looks adorable  it does flare a little and makes me feel like im wearing a maternity top but i dont care i love it  went back to another retailer location and purchased the lilac one cant wait to wear that one

i adore this blouse but the cut is a bit weird the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousyboxy the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i dont think this top is for everyone
"my hips are very narrow and i dont have much of a waistline in aline skirts and anything that sits below the waist i wear a size  skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline if this is typically your style of skirt i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual  i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size  its very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things"
this shirt is very flattering which is not the case for all peplum tops vneck is appropriate for work looks great with jeans or khakis highly recommend only con is that the material is quite thin   lbs and xs fit perfectly
purchased this top at my local store usually dont pay full price for clothing but had to have this top so cute and lightweight love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase i bought the floral design
i bought my usual size medium and its huge on me if i sized down my chubneck wouldnt be comfortable the buttons are frustrating the color the pattten the style are  gorgeous i think i will belt mine
"but saldly noi tried the multicolored version in a size m and l the fabric is almost good though a touch sheer and perhaps problematic for washing the real issue though is the fitfyi  broad shouldersback high waisti typically wear a m in a knit top but the waistband was tight and not forgiving i think that the problem was that this is a top with a long waist when i tried to put the waistband where it wanted to be longer it made the peplum stand out in an odd way from my"
just note the pink is different than in the photos much hottermore saturated apart from that surprise overall id recommend nice design
this is my favorite purchase so far i am in love with this jumpsuit it it fitted on top and has a flowy dress feel on the bottom i got this on sale recently and if you can grab it do it you wont be disappointed
"if you are looking for a nice vest this vest is nice enough comfortable and soft the cut is also flattering but i just didnt think it was as special as i wanted it looks like many other options out there so i decided to passxs fit me at  lbs"
i liked this dress but wasnt sure about the color on me i tried it on anyway originally i tried on the  but it seemed big so i ordered the  also usually i order petite but this dress is already short and i am not getting younger so i went with regular size this time color was not bad on my pale skin i think the hue was ok surprisingly one thing that might bug the perfectionist in me the zig zag isnt always aligned the waist for instance was crooked but if it is like that e
comfortable great fit and beautiful colors the interesting thing is that in this picture it shows the dress just below the knee i am  so totally average height but the dress falls just above my ankles which i personally think is way more attractive not sure if there are two versions of this dress but be careful if you buy online i got mine in the glendale store
i loved the styling of this dress the first time i saw it i ordered it and i slipped it on and wow it is super comfortable the darts at the waist add shape and interest the shape highlights the waist the fabric is cozy without being weighty i did find it ran large and wish there was an xxs available my husband loved it and he doesnt like anything it is likely that the reviewers who think that t looked like a nightgown may have needed a smaller size i think this one is a diamond in the

i purchased this vest in the store the colors vary depending on where it is sewn  i purchased one with black around the middle and more black around the collar it was more flattering the fit and design are lovely its fuzzy but since i dont have any fur in my wardrobe this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me i highly recommend it even for the price
"i like the way this vest looks its flattering and the color is nice just like in the pictures i got the orange one i am   lb got size s and i am very happy about the fitjust keep in mind that the material is very soft and thin it is good for summer but i expected the material to be more firm something to be worn on cooler windier days also the vest does not close  i would prefer the vest to have a zipper or buttonsbut if you need a fun and cute summer accesso"
i saw this vest at my local retailer store over the weekend and decided to try it on i am typically an xs at retailer and the xs fit perfectly i cant wait to wear this during the spring and summer its really lightweight and soft which i love i purchased the copper color and would consider the color in the photo to be very true this was definitely a splurge but i am overall very happy with my purchase i highly recommend it
i had a really really difficult time reviewing this dress the instant i touched it i wanted to love it in theory it should have worked for me fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body best of both worlds however as you can see for yourself in the photo this dress makes me look pretty big im a solid size  and i feel this dress makes me look like a  it really makes my middle
i tried this on today because when i touched it it was irresistibly soft i like the orange it was a loud orangeand i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my styleit was very plain i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory that said it was very comfortable and soft
im in love with this top looks just like it does in the photos except the colors are maybe a little more vibrant its definitely boxy so you may not like it if boxy isnt your thing but i think the pattern placement really works with the boxy shape i usually wear a small in tops and the xss fits great its also machine wash and tumble dry which is a plus although i havent washed it yet unique chic and effortlessorder before its gone
so sad that this cardigan did not fit me i listened to the review i read and tried a small didnt come close to fitting i tried a medium and it also did not fit i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest i usually always fit into a size mediumthat being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine has an interesting design and is well made so sad this item didnt work for me 
bought on a whim on sale  i am a small in  retailer but got these in m for comfy casual loosenessperfect  i am  and these hit the top of my feetperfect  fabric is substantial but not heavyperfect for cool so cal evenings   color is rich denimy bluebeautiful  buttons are pretty i have nothing negative to say about these aside from their price even on sale  oh and the knot  as i sit on my squishy leather sofa i feel the knot in my back  hmmm  oh well  still love them
soooo disappointed in this dress the colors are beautiful for fall the fabric feels luxe the slip fits perfectly the dress however is a hot mess it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flowy aline dress huge everywhere under the arms and waist and hips its just an enormous tent i am   lbs i ordered my usual size small i looked shapeless in this i cant think of any body type it would flatter potentially women quite far along in their pregnancy
i was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it unfortunately the stock image of this pullover is misleading its boxy image makes it seem like its formfitting and the weavemesh is much thicker and open in person as shown you do need a cami underneath i ordered this in a small and medium since its an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit i wanted to love this i didnt think i
"first this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look however there are several items to note primarily this sweater is very expensive the wool has an itchy feel the quotdrapequot is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom so it is annoying when you first put it on it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves"
i love this blouse the color is so pretty i might even wear this to a holiday party the tie looks great so many wayslove the versatility i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blousewith a pencil skirt jeans or under a blazer
"love the color and overall design of this dressbut its just going to have to go back the view from the direct front and back are nice but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant not the look im going for especially at this pricethe other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed in the back its all i see which is right on a bullseye and the same on the front i dont know how the designer missed this its the only white design on th"
i didnt think much of this tank while perusing sale items on the website but after reading the reviews i decided to order it and it did not disappoint i ordered the green which is more vibrant inperson than on the website and i wore it the next day which is always a good sign i loved it so much i quickly ordered the white too it is flattering stylish and comfortable  an excellent combination i highly recommend this tank as a summer staple it goes with everything

bought this dress on sale in the orange as i feel like everything i have is black it is a pretty orange not too bright more of a rust color it is very soft as stated in other reviews and has a nice built in slip that is very comfortable i worry about pilling down the road but will have to wait and see i am not crazy about the seams down the chest area i think they could be more flattering but overall the dress is comfortable cute and easy to wear a perfect dress for the fallwinter with

this dress style and color is very flattering i think i will wear it in the spring and fall as well as the winterthe m fits me and im  and  pounds
i love this top its perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer its material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer its a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then id size down one size from your normal i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly im tempted to buy this in more colors
found this little surprise in store yesterday where thankfully one of my atlanta stores carries petites the materials is wonderful  feels like cashmere i got the rust which will be an anytimeanywhere piece recommend highly
i had the pleasure of trying this on today and looooooove it i love all things bows but usually they are offcentered over the left shoulder i have a bit of an ocd thing and i prefer things to be over my right shoulder so usually while i love them i cant wear them i love that this bow is in the middleand i like that it is higher than the neckline of the shirt so you know there is some skin underneath it adds to the sexiness of the blouse while also creating a more pleasing look i feel
i tried this jacket on and found it extremely flattering the knit is soft and feels more like a sweater than a jacket in that it isnt constricting i am usually between a small and medium and the small was plenty big the fur collar is a special touch the one i tried on had several loose threads hanging from the seams and the seams puckered a bit here and there i loved the jacket but did not feel that the quality in construction i would expect was there however the fit is so flattering i m
i just received this top  it is stunningly beautiful however i will be returning it as it is very large i am tall at  and typically wear a size  i purchased this in the size s but it was very large i should have read the reviews about sizing before ordering although i think both the xxs and xs were already sold out
i love this top i found it to be true to size i usually wear a size large or extra large and the size large fit well i really appreciate that the armholes are not gigantic and dont show underthings i bought the navyblack and find that a navy cami works well under it i like this with casual pants and jeans under an open front sweater for now and think it will be nice with a linen skirt or shorts in warmer weather this is not a style i would usually wear but i found the two tone lace very
"i really like this shirt but its a bit maternity i dont mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here im   about  and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret since im done having kids it has to go back its also somewhat see through and had i kept it i would have worn a tank top underneathas long as these things dont bother you it really is cute"

ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped spandex so returned
the colors are amazing so vibrant and plentiful the arm holes are fairly generous but not bad i think it just adds to the loose fitting nature of the dress i got a medium im  with a small chest medium is my norm for maeve the buttons in the back are difficult you need help getting on but getting off you can do solo this dress makes your shoulders look really good it sits in a very flattering way
this dress is very well made the fabric is thick enough for winter weather and is great for work or a nice party i do not think the arm openings are too large at all
bought this shirt on a whim and it surpassed my expectations just enough business just enough pleasure i wore it with high waisted skinnies and wedges and stopped counting the compliments excited to try it in other ways its summery in print but fall ish in color so i think i can get even more use out of it in the next few months
this blouse is a beauty i love the hemline across the bust and all the flowy fabric that drapes in front and in back i love the long length and the side slits the wide hemline at the bottom is lovely the cotton is soft and light and as amazing to wear as it is to look at it makes me feel beautiful just having it on be aware the fabric is sheer and requires a tank but i dont mind as it is both pretty and comfortable i sized up which fits how i like i never tried it on in my normal size

"i had been eyeing this top online decided to hit my local retailer to try it on it is an adorable spring tunici think it runs a size larger then your usual size for reference i am  and  pds small busted and i bought a size  fits perfect i will machine wash and hang to dry happy with my purchase"
"my favorite white blouse everi was hesitant but really love it it makes me think of summer flowers paris its so soft and comfortable yes the cut is different and took a moment to get used to but i like that and it looks better on imo i can see this getting worn a lot on hot summer southern days ive been on a hunt for a great white blouse for a long time tres chic"
this is a must have way cuter in person love the look and feel it runs large so size down its more cream than white
"hey hei hei where did your side buttons go on this design on all of the other hei heis i own there are two or three very cute side buttons at the hips in belt area with a matching also cute cloth strip attached so that when the pant becomes too lose at the waist you can tighten it up a notch i bought the sky  yellow in these pants in a size  i am  lbs and  when i first put these on they fit just like i want them too a bit of a boyfriend pant feel not too slouchy but witho"
i wanted to add my two cents because i was worried when ordering the pants from previous reviews that they would be to tight as it had been suggested they run small i didnt find that to be the case and think they run true to size

so i thought this sweater would be snowy white but its actually a beige kind of dingy color i do not mean that its unattractive i do like it just because it is not snowy white like i thought it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either its a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the topthe picture does no
i saw this dress and had to have it it is very cute and comfortable i have fuller hips so im not sure about the stripe across the widest section of my body the arm holes are a little gaping as well as other reviewers have mentioned i bought the medium which fits well everywhere but the arm holes i think the small would fit me everywhere but the hips so im on the fence of whether to keep it i do like the dress and it is of good quality it just may not be the right fit for me im a
beautiful dress i like the length and cut nice material runs a bit big i think itll look nice with a belt great colors
i saw this blouse referenced online a few times and have a weakness for white blouses so off i went to my local retailer this blouse turned out to be delightful my thoughts i would say it fits true to size as a  fits me perfectly in the shoulders it is a flowy tunic blouse that has a high skit so its not possible to wear this as a dress it is very sheer too i do think this blouse is designed for the line to hit below the bust so my incredibly flat chest works in this if you have even
if i could wear this top every single day i would this is the white flowy top ive been dreaming of but better the fabric is so lightweight and breathable i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf skinny jeans  ankle boots or on a hot summer day with shortsskinnies and sandals you can dress it up or down be aware that the chest hem is at a nontraditional height not quite above or below the breasts however i think it looks flattering on both smallchested and busty women
this vest is great im wearing with my red striped turtleneck dress i got on sale here i can see this going with so many outfits mainly those dresses that might feel a little tight around butt and hip area this will cover it all worth full price imo tts im a  and this in m is perfect
i was on the fence about keeping but the more i tried it on the more i liked it i feel like it will be a great winter casual top the reason i was on the fence was because its pretty big im  and  and the xs is pretty voluminous on me its just so darn different and feminine though that im going to live with the fact that there is so much material i think it is still cute the fabric is also really soft on the inside so it will be cozy too

this top is really cute  a light sweater with a feminine lace detail i would recommend it if youre looking for a flowy feminine top to wear before it gets really cold out the only reason i didnt give it  stars is because the material is a little prone to pulls and snags i wore it once and got a pull from my cross body bag thankfully i was able to manipulate the threading and the pull is almost unnoticeable but just know that its a pretty delicate sweater and youll have to be careful
this dress is beautiful it is not meant to be super form fitting so in my opinion it was true to size altho i could see how others may want it to be more so in which case size down it came wrinkled but they make it in petite so they are forgiven and the material is such that im not sure how it could be prevented
this vest is super cute im   and usually wear an xs at retailer i have this in a small and it fits perfectly fits snug when zipped my usual xs would have definitely been too tight would definitely recommend
i really liked this cardigan when i saw it today the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering i love the idea of the safety pin closure and i really like how the model wears it in this photoopen with the pin on the side when i saw this instore it was closed in the front with the pin which i also like i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model so it looked fantastic however when i tried it on myself it wasnt quite the same
"i purchased this jacket in a pxs as i am  and  the sleeve length is perfect the fabric is soft and lightweight which is perfect for living in southern california i dont feel any itchiness either the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips there are two cute grommets on each side at the bottom by the hem which add nicely to the look i like how the sleeves are ribbed giving it a comfy sweater feel theres also two zippered pockets whic"

ordered this in white and the peachy color the armholes were gaping not well designed i dont recommend this tee at all
i loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress unfortunately this dress missed the mark in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white well it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink bright baby pink even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink huge disappointment my other issue is with the length of this dress the description says that the
saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on so lovely i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person its like a muted blue that makes it so versatile the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering the safety pin is such a unique touch its nice and warm just not super soft but not scratchy i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily
i tried this on in white and my usual size small it is such a beautiful top and the detailing lace trim is so pretty my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage and i dont have much it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area its also one of thoseam i hiding a pregnancy tops i like it but i think ill wait to see if it goes on sale
this sweater is very cute i got a medium im broad in the shoulders and a  i wanted it a little loose threw it over a tshirt and was not itchy at all i feel it is light weight and perfect for our mild winters in florida cant wait till the weather cools down to wear it
these pants are very very cute and high quality they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down they are also very flattering i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch  but the next size up was perfect
lovely crochet lace tunic also very comfortable doesnt wrinkle and the cotton has a lovely feel
this dress is even more gorgeous in person i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years i think i have finally found the one i should note i am  and this dress goes all the way to my knees it may swallow someone on the shorter side
i tried on a regular size at the store and definitely need petite   lbs the dress is comfrotbale and the ivory color gives it a victorian feel the sleeves are nice a cover the shoulder in a flattrering spot where hte muscles meet there is alining so not seethrough length was too long why i need petie also loosefitting i would like it more a little more fitted jsut a bit
i love these jeans they are really cute and comfy however they are way too long i couldnt believe these were a  inch inseam but i measured them and they are i am  and put on a  inch heel and they were still dragging on the ground  these will have to go back as i dont think the same look can be pulled off if they were hemmed
i like the jeans a lot theyre definitely skinny fit and more like leggings  very stretchy i feel like they would fit all shapes and sizes because of that give so the claim that theyre flattering on everyone is probably valid i also appreciate that there is no stonewashing as grey jeans often seem to have  they are all one hue from top to bottom with a little bit of linear line texture to the fabric the only flaw at least i dont think its intentional is that the front pockets l

this is a great everyday dress i bought it in black and it looks cute with wedges its a little boxy but that also makes it super comfy so i dont mind that too much definitely order onesize down if youre between sizes you may want to consider petite if its available becuase i found it to be a bit long for my taste im  and it hits at the knee ive already worn it a few times and have had received several compliments
i love this dress for its unique design with the crochet features it is super comfortable great for being layered without see through i ordered a small though and it is still too large for me i have been trying to decide on returning it since i love it so much id recommend sizing down for this dress im   and still needed an xs which seems a bit off i guess im used to retailer running a bit big but i miss judge this one and hate to deal with the mailing and worrying
this is a beautiful highquality little black dress it actually has a little weight to it but nothing bothersome i usually take a medium across the board but i had to size up to a large this is dress has more of a straight line versus aline and i have wider hips so the large fit really good its beautiful and versatile i just wore it to my high school reunion and got compliments   great purchase i would highly recommend
when i saw this sweater it made me think of the  chic trend thats very now but due to the colors my favorite tones it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress see photo  i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress paeonia dress and i paired it with the rosebud layered necklace i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out  i am   and even thoug
"this is a flattering skirt for work or play a few things to be aware of  it is a lightweight knit without a lining would travel great and never need ironing the waist is quite high  the waist is quite slim people with tummy selfconsciousness might feel funny in it the hang is flattering for people with butts and hips such as myself true to size for mei decided not to keep it because i couldnt come up with enough tops to love it with and because for the money i would"
this sweater has a retro feel to it i like how it hits right at the hips and its not too long or not too short it keeps you warm and its a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter
even at a very deep discount this piece is definitely not worth the money the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design which would be coolwhich is largely what attracted me to it but as i discovered when it arrived that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo so this image is rather misleading the actual jacket is very thinmore like a shirt with an open front than a jacket the pockets are just loosely tacked inside for
i disagree with the other reviewer  i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality and while it wasnt lined i dont think lining is typical in a sweater material i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape i usually wear a  or  but my store only had a  available it fit but was a little tight in the hips the skirt was also longer on me then on the model but im on the short side
this is a sweater i love to look at and wear for any occasion it looks on me almost exactly like the model picture in the online photo im  i bought a small and it fits very loose and comfortable i would suggest  size smaller than usual would fit well i usually wear small for tops and medium dresses it is great to layer with a brown or rusty copper large cardigan it has a somewhat southwest blanket look with its colors of soft apricot and soft brown plus  turquoise stripe it dresse
i ordered my usual size  from retailer and it fit perfect for reference i am  and  pounds unlike the other reviewer i did not have trouble getting into or out of dress it buttons down the middle so you just need to make sure you undo them enough to get past your chest i really like this dress i think its beautifully made is it my favorite dress ive purchased from retailer no but still a nice dress
i bought the xs and love it it looks better on than in the picture it travels well no wrinkles after being in the suitcase and it is generous on the sides so you can actually eat a full lunch and not feel boxed in afterwards
this is so retailer  pretty in pink unique design and print i love origami and i love pink and this blouse is a perfect combo i ordered size petite s im   waist  hips and it fits perfectly the hem falls on the upper hips just like shown on the model the top has structure not too soft and not too stiff i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms like me this top has everything flair bright color unique print but al
"the fit and design are interesting in the  the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of  strategy required the quality is fine but the color was very blah with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused with the lining and material weight it would be more a cold weather item only not an all seasonal dressgenerally it was interesting but not a most come home wit"
i got this as a gift and one for me the medium fits my mom but i got the large because im  and it was large enough but so short waisted i wouldnt recommend it for women over 
i caught this on sale and bought the light pink version it is very lightweight and delicate i must admit on taking it out of the box i was a little concerned at the shape  design but once i tried it on i found it draped beautifully and was really a good buy it is very unique and i think i could wear it with nice slacks for work or keep it more casual with jeans and a tshirt on the weekend the only drawback is that the material is not what you would expect from a sweater it does feel more

wow this sure is close fitting as in suction cups to your body yikes definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves to me it seems like the material will wear well i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it not sure it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even  lbs it wont work i ordered the medium and am usually a small the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas
this dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue having said that i think as long as you wear fleshcolored undergarments youd be fine in a casual situation the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty my store didnt have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it
i think this jacket is meant to be large on for a particular look with an xs i had no problem its large but slouchy and cute i adore it
this jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back i think it will be great on a taller person
very cute jumpsuit especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs the pattern is striking and bold but not garish it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath i did even though it has padding for those who want to go braless i purchased a  and it fit my   lbs frame perfectly i would highly recommend
i bought this jumpsuit in both fabrics i adored the fit and feel of both but sadly the graphic fabric was not handled well in the construction three examples a thin white piece along one leg seam made it look like a hole mismatched large pieces of white in the crotch area looked sloppy and wrong worst of all a diagonal was placed on both breast pieces but they were different angles which again looked sloppy and wrong in a place where you really want it to look neat and right too bad b
i tried this topper sweater on at the store but wanted to wait for it to go on sale so i just purchased it with my extra thirty percent off and think its such a nice deal i really like how this one is soft well made has nice long sleeves and how adorable the inside lining is the lining matches the print inside the pockets that peak out a bit i didnt find this one too boxy for me as its a topper after all there are no closure buttons or clasps but i think its a great piece to throw on w

this was absolutely adorable on it does look a bit like a dress but at  and  lbs i am normally a size  and needed the  in this it fit so perfectly i didnt consider the petite i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down only draw back is dry clean only super cute and i definitely recommend this cuter in person and on
these jeans fit very well and of good quality  i think they need to be broken into a bit like most new jeans overall i am happy with my purchase
i have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans and have loved them all these unfortunately i do not like i think they run large and the fit just blah the waist gapped and kinda had a mom jean look i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand
love this skirt perfect length and cut pilcro make more of these i ordered up so that it hug more on my hips than waist just prefer that better but i think if you can pull of the waist look go for it would buy more in different colors
i got the blue with polka dots it fits more like a midi dress it is a bit large im usually a size  and got a size  its gorgeous on i dont think ill be needing a bra underneath this its got a supportive band and the ribbon also helps i might order the other bold print too it just looks so good on
i am so happy i splurged and bought these jeans based on the other reviewer i ordered one size up and they fit perfectly im  and appreciate the longer inseam i cant wear a wedge heel or anything with them but with a flat on they skim the floor perfectly youll love the raw hemline and the subtle wear throughout the fabric its not overdone just like in the picture they really seem to narrow the hip think page boy style very very flattering
these jeans are fantastic  the denim is very high quality and the fit is true to size the dark rinse is very flattering and pairs well with almost anything my only small gripe is that the length is a bit awkward im  and it fits more like a regular pair of jeans not anklelength just something to keep in mind if youre not super tall like the model in the picture
i really loved this skirt on the model i ordered it in my typical  and it fit well the green was adorable and the buttons are rose gold which is quite pretty i did exchange this skirt for a  only because the  was just too short for me if the  is a bit longer but not terribly huge in the waist i will probably keep it i was surprised by how large the a line felt but i think i can get used to it it really is very fun and very easy to dress up or down im really hoping the bigger si
i absolutely love this skirt i feel like the color works well for most seasons you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months or layer it with a sweater thick tights and boots in autumn really nice staple piece for your wardrobe i do think it runs a bit large i generally wear a  depending on the brand and style but this  was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches i returned it and got a  which fit me perfectly its nice that

i love the feel of the fabric and design of this dress  i look forward to changing the look with cowboy boots or fringed booties i also like the option of wearing it opened over a white tee and jeans worn loose or belted it can be different every time you wear it it does run large so you may want to size down
i really like the color of this and the feel but that is where it ends it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves i could purchase the belt with it but i dont prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own
cute shirt with a few nice details embroidery and tasseled tie in back a little pricey in my view for what you get nice loose cut true to size cotton is very sheer im wellstocked on white seethrough shirts that require a cami looking for one that doesnt need layering returned for this reason
i think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i dont know how i would use this top i dont mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops if people see my bra slightly so be it but this is really sheer unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this and in my mind that defeats the purpose of a lightweight sleeveless top i returned it and was sorry to have to do that

this dress is super cute good quality from the front it is very flattering and hangs well from the side and back it looks huge i ordered a size  and i am a normal  or  i have reordered the  and size  to see if there is less material others have mentioned that the arms are smaller in the smaller size my trouble area is my hips so i dont think this will be an issue as i am quite small on top if not i will have it altered because it is so cute and can be worn many different ways
these are very cool leggings the cut out design really puts them several classes above a simple black legging they can be worn with dressier tops and could be a sophisticated looking outfit i wore them for the first time today and really loved them i didnt feel like i was out in leggings but more like i was wearing a nice pair of pants the fabric is soft and the cut is very flattering all over  including the rear they are definitely sculpting and firming they fit the same sizewise as
based on others reviews i knew i needed to try this beauty on to be sure of my size as others mentioned it runs  sizes large but unlike others i dont feel i need a belt at the waist i am    and with my body style super short and not super slim in the waist but also busty this is the perfect boho fit and the perfect drape  and the design and quality are superb to boot
this cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks i love the fit of the small  and smallmedium build would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home
i love this top i ordered it online thinking that it would be a comfy top for the weekends and i was right the front is a heavier fabric than the whisper thin tops and yet the back is a wonderfully lightweight cotton handkerchief feel i am petite and it fits great
i cant say enough about this top the material is soft and comfy  very well made the length and  size is spot on looks great tucked in or out very versatile highly recommend
i just purchased this cute dress on sale and made sure to size down one size so instead of my regular small i ordered an extra small which fits me perfectly im a petite yet busty  and  and think the dress looks adorable on especially since im a huge fan of all things plaid its a lighter weight dress so its perfect for spring or summer but can be worn in fallwinter with this color scheme by adding tights boots and a sweater or jacket i also love that it has pockets i dont
i got this in black size medium my usual size i am fairly curvy on top and found the shape in that area very flattering to my figure it is shown as being rather drapey in front and indeed it does fit rather large at the bottom  indeed through the body itself since im slim there i will have to tailor it am used to this considering i have to buy to fit my chest but im keeping it for sure as i love the fabric and i think it will become a staple of my wardrobe good job retailer
i initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry although i ended up wearing another black dress i kept this  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace this dress is easy to wear   and stylish most importantly comfortable i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up but want to wear something that is not fussy and the pockets
these sleep pants are very pretty soft and comfortable unfortunately after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price i dont mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case im not so sure i guess if you dont really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then whats the point of buying them

this top is another winner from left of center i love swing tops and this is just adorable fitted through the sleeves and top portion it drapes nicely in a very flattering way without looking maternity i love the rayon on the upper back which adds interest and a slight contrast i purchased it in the gold color which is beautiful and the fabric is light and very comfortable in my opinion it runs large im usually a sp but ordered an xsp for a more fitted look but it still looked big for
i never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss first off its about  sizes too big second off its knitted with a metallic thread that you cant really notice in the picture im usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient
this top is awesome i purchased the gold color in a small fits perfectly and true to size sleeves are nice and long definitely recommend
i would highly recommend this top it is beautiful and it helps to hide problem areas much prettier than the picture depicts i am very happy with this purchase cant wait to wear with black or white capris this summer
these pants are super comfy and fit true to size i went up to a size large because i wanted them extra roomy and longer im  and  and generally wear a size  in pants i highly recommend them for stylish and comfy lounge pants
i ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived it didnt look quite like it does in the photos online it also runs small i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price
i tried it on in the store  loved it but didnt purchase then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it its lightweight and perfect for southern california the embroidery adds funk and femininity im  and feel like this works well for any age im typically a large or  and the large fit perfect i cant wait till the temps drop so i can wear it
"prosthis dress is so super soft and warmi feel like im just wearing a winter throw when i have it onconsway way too big i returned the small which easily should have been a large with room to spare and got the extra smallits still way too big they definitely have this dress clipped behind her back so it doesnt look so huge and theres a reason there isnt a video showing how this dress looks when it movesbecause it is ginormous and they know itbut i still kept the xs"
like the other reviewers i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model i think shes wearing a large size and its probably cinched in the back still cute though im   and a medium fits well  looks cute with highwaisted jeans which i wear anyway
i love these jeans i am usually a size  or  in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size  i chose the baggier fit the size  did fit but it was a more fitted look so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing but the availability of these makes it almost impossible i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha
yes this is a bit expensive however it is made in the usa so that is a very good thing i appreciate having the opportunity to buy high quality welldesigned basic pieces that are simultaneously supporting my community and country when you are considering this pretty top please click on the gold so that you can see the detail it is very wellmade and flattering i love how it has a slight shape at the back very flattering and feminine the feel and weight of the cotton is remarkably com
this is one of my favorite retailer dresses  its flowy and makes me feel beautiful i loved it so much that i bought it in two colors it does run big so i would size down but when you find your size youll love it
i really liked the dress on line but i didnt appreciate how lovely it was until i received it it fit perfectly and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork
im in love with this dress i have seen the chevron pattern of this dress on many women and i can honestly say that i havent seen a body that it doesnt look good on i am a busty girl and was afraid the shape of this dress would make me look as if i was expecting and much to my surprise it didnt at all this is such a great transitional piece to have in your closet i highly recommend it
im in love with this dress and first tried on the petite size in the store if you dont have enormous shoulders which i do  i think the petite would fit someone in the  range what im trying to say is the dress is pretty long the cut is beautiful and patterns perfectly complementary ive been reading marie kondos book and this one sparks joy
i really love this top normally i would not go for a lot of narrow stripes like this because i would think it is too busy but this one is certainly the exception both colors are fantastic and i think the design is alluringnot busy i like that it buttons down which offers a lot of flexibility to display necklaces or have completely up to complete change the look one of the things i absolutely love about this is that it has long sleeves i think it is rare these days to find something that i

this is a great summer dress i bought this dress in both l and xl because this brand varies i kept the l because the fit was better the xl was wider and had larger armholes the fabric and colors are beautiful lots of compliments it is lined highly recommend
i love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer however this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering opening to hit you right i did really like the color  ordered the brown and material but back it goes
i wanted to love this blouse so much but try as i might it just fit so oddly on me im usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown first the color was more graybrown but it was still ok but second the fit was off maybe i just got a bad one but the center of the blouse was so offset that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the vneck was so low that you could see my bra  there was no adjusting i could do to fix it the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
these pants are really pretty and comfrotable and i took a cahnce ordering them with a  inch inseam i thought perhaps they would work with a  heelhoweverm it is not the case tey much be much longer than  inches due to the cut out i will not be able to have htem hemmed so htey must go back if you are taller i recommend they are truly flattering
i got  of these dresses one in the navy with small flowers and the grayyellow print i am  and the navy looked a little old fashioned on me i think if you are younger it would be super cute the grayyellow diagonal stripe is super cute its a more modern design in the fabric and i love it it will be my favorite go to dress for the summer i also think it will pack nicely for trips i am  and wear a small or medium with retailer clothes and i got a small in this dress and its p

this dress is beautiful  it is just as pretty as it looks in the picture if not prettier it is a great material the colors are beautiful and it is perfect to throw on in the summer i highly recommend it
i feel for the reviewer who didnt like this top i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering just too short when i sized up everything changed this top is amazingsuper flattering and high quality i love the material vcut and subtle way the tassels hang i wish they had more colorsi would buy them all this top sold out in a day at my store its a winnerjust make sure you size up
soft silky lined in silky natural fabric hangs great without being weighty extremely flattering on my xl short body im petite but for tunic dresses always order regular sizes so they go just a hint over my kneesexactly what i need lovely details sequins and weighted tassels highly recommend
i get so many compliments every time i wear this dress friends strangers younger older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress it has a  vibe to it fun and swingy perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler i think it will look great with leggings and boots i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite im  and  and it hit just above my knee my favorite dress right now
i love this tank topthe fringe on the bottom is fun and ive gotten many compliments on it alreadyi think it runs true to size 
i saw this in the store and decided to try it on it is so pretty the fit is perfect i didnt think that i would like it due to the sequins on the front when i put it on i didnt mind them at all it really is a beautiful dress with beautiful colors dry clean only is the only drawback to this one

i love clothing with elements that elevate them from basic to extraordinary this tops does that for me the black is a rich dark charcoal grey the modal fabric blend has a nice feel and drapes well however the cut is very body conscious and i found both the medium and large tight in the midriff my problem area since i love it so much i will keep the medium since the sleeves are looser on the large it looks exactly as pictured and would fit well on someone with a waistline
this dress is gorgeous flattering oood quality and in my opinion better than the erin fetherston dress because of the black rather than nude liner which really brought our the beautiful embroidery come on practically everything in rtw is a knockoff of something i do have to comment that the slip is quite snug though but at least its stretchy that being said it still had a bit of a tendency to creep up i was glad i had a black half slip on as well the fit is tts but a bit short wa

great quality and cut they are so versatile which i love highly recommend these
"i am tall  and  and mostly leg with a shorter torso so i am always looking for longer shirts to balance my leg to torso ratio i ordered this in the tan and blue colors in a large and so far have loved both of them i am typically a medium in tops but tend to get the large for the extra length and have the top altered to fit if need be however there was no need to alter these tops making me think the tops typically run small both tops are sheer requiring a tank of some sort to b"
this dress is a great dress for spring and summer and early fall events its surprisingly light weight and comfortable you can pair different shoes with the dress due to the various colors which makes it easy to dress up and down i definitely recommend if youre looking for a fun floral feminine dress
count me in as a five star lover of this dress the details are so rich and interesting so be prepared to get noticed when wearing im happy to say that getting the size medium regular instead of petite was a good choice for my top heavy frame the chest is fitted but not tight the length is a nottooshort above knee the tiered layers swing so nicely and the beadssequins add a touch is whimsy to the design my one negative is the tassels at the neck tiesoo heavy cumbersome to style o
this dress is lovely  it flows nicely and is extremely flattering  also true to size  unfortunately i do not care for a lot of glittersparkle which this dress has going down the very front so it is going back  wish i could pull off the glitter but cant  i absolutely love this dress otherwise and very much recommend it
the most disappointing thing about buying flare jeans when youre  is taking them to the tailor to have a chunk of what makes them flares hacked off not so with the petite  inseam on these love the perfect amount of stretch the rise is high but not too high and the flare is perfect definitely recommend
i was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color ladies with hips or a booty bewarethis looked horrible on me it clung to my butt and didnt hang nice and straight like it does in this picture i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it
this top definitely looks better in person i thought it looked pretty online but when i tried it on it looked even better this top is on the longer side and fits like it looks on the model the fabric is perfect in my opinion because i dont have to  dry clean it  iron it or  worry about it itching or bothering my skin i am   lbs and  ab i purchased a size xs and it drapes wonderfully i love the crochet around the neckline the  length sleeves and the colors of the
i ordered the xxs p and it is almost big so between true to size and big it is both flattering and stretchy the waist comes in nicely the sleeves are not annoying and the sparkle add to the lbd in my opinion length was right above the kneejust i am  lbs   in waist for reference

i just received these denim joggers this is my first pair of denim joggers and they are absolutely stunning i like the decorative band i do feel as these will be a staple in my wardrobe the possibilities with these joggers are endless
i wish these fit more like joggers but they are slightly poofier with the big buttons i felt a bit too clownish however its a great statement piece if youre up for it the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture i think the problem was that since linen doesnt drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics so it holds more volume instead of loose semiflowy menswear look i
they fit me great are super comfortable they are casual yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions i love them with booties  i think they look better in person than online too

this fits like a regular top for me i can take petite on top most of the time i bought this in a medium regular and it fits like my regular high low tees or tops i think its so cute on its light weight enough for warmer weather im going to love it this springsummer and into fall with a jacket or cardigan another plus is it doesnt gape at the armpit which i get sometimes with regular cuts its not so low cut on me either but i have a   inches bust so that may be why it
this hoodie has a great fit it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy in fact it is quite flattering it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull the hood is a nice size not overwhelming to the back profile i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this now i have a super cute lounge at the lake ensemble
this dress is great its perfect for a casual look with a denim jacket comfortable for traveling and can even be dressed up for a more formal occasion i wore it on a cross country flight torontobritish columbia and was so comfortable with a sweater and scarf to wrap around me if i got cold the only con i found of this dress is the back is a bit low leaving your bra showing and being a  i dont feel comfortable going without a bra i purchased a few of the bralettes to go with it to m
"i love the embroidery detailing on the top i think this shirt looks better in person than onlineim an hourglass shape and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest but this top drapes down nicely however loose shirts like this arent my style so i belt this at my waist and it looks even better the top flatters my broad shoulders meaning that it doesnt make them look wider and it hits below my hips im  i also appreciate that the armholes are small"
this top is just amazing it does run large so size down but fit and feel is wonderful especially if you would like to hide some lumps and bumps this is the perfect top
i love this top the material is soft but good quality and not flimsy the cut is fitted and flattering the color of the fabric is ivory not bright white the embroidery is a good quality and doesnt easily fray the fit is true to size i highly recommend this top i wear it with jeans and it looks really cute always get compliments its very comfortable too
i ordered a size xl its flowy so it could be running larger but since the fit in the shouldersnecksleeves matches the model i think its truetosize for the design it is so comfortable i love the softness of the material the problem for me is the color on my monitor it looks like a light ivory or white but the embroidered lace bib portion is a darker ivory shade that doesnt work for my complexion so ill be returning mine everything is wellmade though especially the vintagestyl
this top is cut too short  wide with too much light material in between to be truly slimming  flattering it needs to have more of the rayonspandex blend to make it heavier  bouncier then it would hang appropriately and swing and hopefully not add pounds to the wearer unfortunately this top is too lightweight  has too much material pass
the weight and feel of this jacket is what i was hoping for it is medium weight making it my go to on cool days and is also very flattering to wearit actually gives you shape i like the front texturing on the scroll work and the pockets are well placed if anything could be different i would have preferred a little more room in the sleeves as they run slightly snug so not made to wear with anything with bulk but overall not an issue
"this dress is stunning it is beautifully made with laces and beading in a way that is art it fits in a very flattering and comfortable way i think is would flatter any body type the details are captivating and it immediately grabs the spotlight when you walk into a roomi ordered online and when it arrived i was stunned with its exotic use of fabrics texturesa rare find and a must have"
i really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view
this top is beautiful on it has very feminine detail and is very flattering the first time i wore it i got  compliments on it i would definitely recommend
i love this dress i love the style i love the pattern i love the feel of the fabric theres a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me however i think it runs a little large particularly because its not fitted at all  that tie around the waist is the only defining feature and its a great one this dress and your figure needs it i am  pounds  and i normally wear a  perhaps i shouldve known to try a small but i went with my usual size in dresses

i loved the colors especially the pink and thought this would be really pretty however when i received it its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it i also found it huge normally i wear an xxsp or a  for reference i am   and  in waist i tried both the xxsp fit better but was too short and the xxs too large i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted but its definitely not
the print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty th fabric is a soft tshirt martial i ordered a medium and it fits like a large it is supposed to be flowy and loose though overall i feel beautiful in it great for our hot humid charleston summers
i have admired the workout leggings retailer sells since they debuted last year and i was excited when these went saleonsale theyre very cute and definitely true to size i was worried the white made me look big but with a longish shirt its fine also they arent made from the most athletic fabric  i think if i sweat in them too much theyd get icky fast i dont sweat that crazy from my legs though so i expect theyll be fine
the fabric and style on this swing tee are really nice but be aware it runs really really large i downsized on my order because of the style but it wasnt enough like wearing a tent i would recommend it but know its very full i did return it
this dress it is heartbreakingly gorgeous stunning the entire idea and design is so gorgeous the style with the sleeves embroidery and slight shimmer at the top two layers underneath the dress is extremely gorgeous i am so so so sad i could not keep it i dont get why the sizes are so off here i have come across so many clothes with gorgeous embroidery but too loose or too tight i didnt want to send this dress back but it did not look good it was just too loose sad
i love this dress it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me i am not the tallest person  but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast its just something to be aware of i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess
i was looking for a new pair of pajama pantsaroundthehouse pantsoccasionalquickerrand pants to replace a pair that i bought from retailer six years ago and i fell in love with the look of thesethey are truly comfy and are flattering on the lace adds a nice feminine touch that makes me feel pretty even on my laziest days im hoping these will last me another six years
just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist  i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable i typically am a ml in retailer  the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose these are not see through at all i ordered the color shown on the model i am about  feet  so the pants are not as cropped on me 
classy pants that can look casual or sophisticated my husband loves them on me for a dinner out i dressed them up with a top from retailer i think these will be a must on my trip to florida this winter since the pants will look great with a t
i was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on it either needs the ruffle taken away  my first choice or the halter part taken away in the end i think it needs to go back
when i first saw this online i knew i had to have it so when dresses were  off i grabbed the deal its perfect its super soft and an appropriate length i love the bell sleevestheyre ultra feminine and slightly trendy but not too much i definitely recommend this dress reference   lbssize  in jeans  in tops and dresses and the small fit me better than the xs
im   and bought xsp seems a bit too short for my taste especially since this is a popover but not bad enough to return everywhere else fits tts nothing stunning about it but is unique enough to add to my everyday casual it would be better if there are more colors to choose from
these are a great dark wash and they fit true to size to every other stevies i own for reference i am   size  and the  fit perfect they are a bit long but i fold them up and it looks just as cute i highly recommend especially since they are on sale definitely a closet staple
sometimes you have those days where you feel overweight and unattractive this shirt is perfect for that it has a chic cut and it doesnt look like you are having an off day at all so cute and i really like the length as well i usually wait until items go on sale but this i had to buy right away
i purchased this dress before reading any of the reviews i ended up reading them the day the dress was to arriveand they worried me since i was so excited for this dress i put it on and i feel like it is not much different from the photo here online it is meant to be roomy it is more fitted on top and the back is cute to give it some shape too but it is meant to be loose fitting i personally love it i have added a belt to give it more shape when i want worn it on its own or with a
i saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fallwinter maxi in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better
this unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami skinny jeans and boots im wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline my only slightly negative comment is about the quality the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut still keeping it though
as of late its been difficult for me to find clothing at retailer that fits truetosize im  and  lbs and ive had to return several pieces because they were too big on me this versatile piece fits truetosize i purchased an xsp like the previous reviewer ive tried this with a couple of different longsleeve shirt and tights combinations i think this will work in the spring and fall too as the material is in between heavy and lightairy great for work
i purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic addon to my wardrobe its been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt im not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear but i washed it on gentle cycle and didnt do anything that would have warranted a tear sadly this did not serve up to its purpose i wouldnt suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i dont expec
this ribbed henley is incredibly soft youll love the way it feels but it does run a little small so id recommend getting one size up if you dont want it to be too form fitting
i think this top is great it does show cleavage also its very romantic i cant wait to wear it if only the store had had the red and wine colors in stock too
the pictures online do not do this justice i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe it can actually be worn  ways i like closing the closest snaptheres two in the middle with a skinny belt over it and a slip dress underneath this way the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking think  glam it can also be fully closed like in the picture or left ope
this blouse is easily one of the nicest i have bought in recent times the quality is excellent the design demonstrates that design and nature are extremely compatible i have worn this blouse with jeans and in a more formal situation and with a little more jewelry the blouse fits in perfectly anywhere i highly recommend it
i wish this fit me better i love the inside fur it is extremely soft but it doesnt look flattering at all it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted it wanted it fit over my butt or cover half and it sits a little below my waist unfortunately i am taking it back great idea though
good quality casual feel good dress it can be worn as dress or as tunic over the pants
i saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass  was true to size and the material was very nice however the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small also the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling i had to return this jacket
really pretty for summer especially beach and pool wear but im only  and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats which is my preferred shoe for this dress im also curvy and busty on top so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist its not as flattering as the tall thin model shows but still it looks nice on and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too so im on the fence about keeping it since its really pretty for a summer party
i liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail i normally wear a ml and the medium fit perfect it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist the bottom is flowy i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasnt a surprise but i really wish it came lined no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel its too nice for a cover up
i love the color the fabric and the style especially in the model shots but in reality the cut is disproportionate the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act

when i saw this tunic dress i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things it is also very comfortable true to size and very good quality material i highly recommend
"i gave only  stars because i really wish the fabric was not so sheer unless you are very unmodest you will need to wear a slip i am  feet and it hits just above my ankle slits on side and front i know it is supposed to be use as a beach coverupbut forgot that this is way too pretty not to wear out at nightwith a slip  i am not a fan of the tie waist so i at wear a belt to cover it overall i recommend enjoy"
im  and ordered the small as soon as i saw it in person i knew it was an item to return the material is too transparent and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see it was way too long for me i think it would work for a taller person i just didnt feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency

i think this fits to true to size i am  and  lbs i always wear a xs it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra  if i wore a normal very little padding bra it did not pull much across the bust
i thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed i am  and i usually wear a size small top and  dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasnt expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad i was so upset it also has thin silver lines through it which for me m
"this is truly a lovely dress the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figurein my opinion if fits true to size im   and  and i got it in a  which is the size i normally get in dresses it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being"

this dress is really beautiful very well made and high quality fabrics unfortunately it is cut very narrow i am between sizes ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you
i typically wear xs or s or zeros but i got this in a m  it doesnt look big it looks like a regular fit to me i think a small or xs would have looked and felt small  its soft beautiful and warm  the hood is so cute  the detail is just so good  i love it over top of  long sleeve blouses i got there and one of the cloth and stone button downs
so i saw this dress like a month ago and i fell in love utter ihavetohaveit love before dropping  superfast i gave myself some time to think it over well of course i decided to order it and of course my size was sold out most of the sizes were sold out actually they did have a petite left so after i dried my eyes i decided to wing it the petite actually fit the mid section is a little snugger than i am normally comfortable with although the top is so structured that it ac
"this dress is gourgeous will be able to wear year roundjust add a cardigan or blazerthe only fault i find in it is the waist band is a bit widehowever i have a hour glass shape so my waist is very small"
this blouse with a scalloped hem is a good blouse to wear by itself it goes well with higher waisted bottoms it is very boxy i like that but did buy a petite instead of s regular to compensate i swing both ways on oetiteregular sizing im soso about the patch pockets the material is fairly heavy but they do add to the look of the top its well made and nicely finished
the patterscolors on this dress are much more stunning in person it is lined and feels very well made the pockets dont add bulk to the hip area as many times they do which is great the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves if you can try this one on in a store before buying for reference i am  have broad shoulders am pear shaped i have hips and a good sized rear end  bust weigh  lbs and generally wear a size  or  for tops and bottoms the size  fit
"these jeans are so comfortable and do not stretch out enough to size down in my opinion right when i put them on i could tell they fit perfectly i have been buying pilcros for several years and have not been happy with the stet ankle jeans from the last  yrs because although they were very flattering when you first put them on they stretched out so much it was annoying these script jeans are amazing flattering and are a nice lightweight denim i wore them a few times before washing and"
i am   i bought the charcoal gray in a large and i love it fabric is super soft hangs beautifully no weird spreading across the chest like the previous reviewer i have long arms and the sleeves are long and hit me mid palm just like the model in the photo i have worn the sleeves rolled up and down and it works recommend this for a casual comfy top with interesting design
the color of this dress is sublime so is the fit ruching in all the right places made me feel glamorous its a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat vest or cropped jacket the material feels so nice against the skin too its a must have
my sales assistantstyle consultant watched the dresses i had collected to try on and how they fit and she brought this dress in with a silk cocoon wrap for me to try on i took one look on the hanger and made an assumption it would be too snug highlight every bump and i could not have been more wrong this dress is wonderful on it is the most flattering thing i have now in my closet you must try this on to see how flattering it is i am still stunned with how it looked and made me feel
wow bailey  knocks it out of the park with this sensual iamwomanhearmepurr bodyslimming dress we all have our hang ups this dress forces you to see all the beauty that everyone else sees the rouching covers up any dimpling or rolls you think you have the body conscious structure lets you see those curves you knew existed but deny yourself from loving oh  you hate your arms me too guess what  you dont even notice them because youre so focused on how amazing you look the cut
"i wasnt planning on loving this dress when i tried it on i loved the the color which is what prompted me to buy it this dress fit perfectly it hugs my body without feeling tight the ruching is perfect i didnt want to take it off its also very comfortableim    and the xs petite fit perfectly the dress hits me at the same length that is pictured i think it would be easy to hem if you wanted it to be shorter i have a short torso and saw no issues with that as some reviewer"
the material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater but the furry portion made the top too bulky i shouldve sized down but even then i think it still wouldve been a touch boxy if it was boxy all the way through itd be fine but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine perhaps good for more broad shouldered people i have very small shoulders also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug
i was attracted to this sweater because of its unique style i really love it it looks just like the picture it is of good quality as is the leather belt it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that its different i highly recommend this sweater
i thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit after trying it on in a store must have been a return i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small the straps were a little hard to manage it is cute and i think cuter than on the model
this blazer is really well made it has a nice weight and stretch to it i think it might run a bit on the large size i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect its a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look i dont think the picture here does it justice it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe i love it

i was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa i knew the workmanship would be above average the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique i am usually a  in pilcro slouchy chinos size  in most pants   in jeans so i ordered these in xs the waist was at least  inches too large they were enormous in every aspect of fit no belt could possibly make these stay up very disappointed  i would recommend an xs if you are a size  to 
my usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small the button popped and i had barely moved do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work
i loved this dress and was hoping to keep it but for an align dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips
like other reviewers have stated this dress does run small on the chest im    and size  fits me great however if my chest size had been like  and up size  will not fit me although im petite frame so if you have a large chest i would recommend going  or  sizes up if you are like myself small bust person then you should try your regular size and one size down to see which one fits you better i was going to try size zero however as soon as i tried size  i rea
i swooned over this dress when it first came online i had never worn a petite size before so i wasnt sure about the fit i am curvy  and normally wear a size  dress but the  fit me like it was made for my body i think this is because the dress runs large but i really really enjoyed the fit the quality of the lace is evident immediately and the color is more of a cornflower blue which i adore the lace feels like a soft cotton but has a lot of strength to it cannot recomme
i thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe and while the color didnt disappoint everything else did its a very loose slub so its very see through and thin id have to wear a cami under it also the tie front has a very high slit like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga gym wear but definitely not at this price pass for me sadly
im   with a  chest this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu i cant imagine this looking good on anyone who isnt  tall also the straight across rather high neck line wasnt flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap it wasnt see through but it had the feel of a nightgown not a hundred dollar dress
i tried this sweater on in the store i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine and would be a great causal layering piece however there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater not to mention unless youre built very narrow the pockets will fall at and accentuate hips and not in a flattering way the nice details are the feel of the knit the layered style with a cottony lined hood and faux lay
i love this sweater i checked runs large but its really just a roomy sweater i bought the small which is what i usually buy but it is big enough to wear over long sleeve shirts etc its soft and cozy and i think i wore it  days straight when i first got it  one of those pieces that you will wear over and over wore it with jeans and a blouse then with palazzos and a tee and then over my workout wear the next day before deciding it was time to give it a rest love this sweater
love this turtleneck its perfect for fall and to layer im usually an xs in things from retailer and this is no different i definitely recommend
i wasnt sure how this top would look on me but i tried it on and i love it plus it is very comfortable i would highly recommend it
loved this jacket so much i bought both colors this jacket is simple yet adds so much to an outfit the lightweight material makes it perfect for the florida seasons as for the snaps mine work perfectly i usually just keep them undone for my hands the sizing i think runs a bit large i usually am a medium but ordered smalls and they fit perfectly even with the perfect amount of breathing room highly recommend

maybe i shouldnt have sized up to an xl but im not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit the vee is quite low and im busty itll be really low if youre smaller on top the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me not tight at all its almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view i looked like a really wide green apple i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldnt recommend it

very soft clean feel i got this in pink and received so many compliments perfect to layer on top of your favorite tee or tank i wish they had it in navy as well
i have still not decided if i am keeping this dress i sized up according to the other reviews i typically wear a  so i got an  it fit me just fine on top but i am a  so fairly small because of the photos i expected the dress to be aline and flare out at the hips it did not that thats why i am unsure id like it to flare out a little more than it does it would be more flattering and more comfortable i love the dress otherwise i think i may take it to a tailor and see if there
i ordered the pink and it was gorgeous the color and feel were so soft i would have kept it if it were a blanket but i did send it back because as a sweater it just didnt lay right it has a sort of inside layer that just didnt fit right with the outside sweater layer so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist that was not flattering and the hood was too large and floppy looking too bad
this hoodie has a lovely flattering drape and fits truetosize m for me and is light but quite warm the cottony nylon layers along the front panels and hood add style it will be warm enough as an outer layer on a slightly brisk day or indoors in cooler weather i was going to opt for the blue but in the store the light gray  which is a bit darker and more marled than online at least on my monitor  looked really lovely and seemed more versatile
its a pretty dress my only concern is the sleeve length its an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better or if you are a savvy sewer you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted overall quality and feel is very good i usually fit into a  but for this dress i ordered both  and  and kept the  the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you dont order the correct size
these jeans i am obsessed the perfect boyfriend fit with an easy relaxed feel i feel instantly cooler when i slip into these do yourself a favor and buy them

this is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen the color and fit is exactly as on the model there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it it is tts in my opinion although the buttons on the back add a nice flair they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so thats why i gave it  stars for design

these socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid i could not get these socks to go any higher than halfway up my calf i would not recommend this product it felt very cheap and not of good quality
this initially caught my eye online and then i immediately tried it on when our store received it the dress is simple and well structured with a tight sweater weave that almost has a hold u in feel therefore it fits like a glove on
i like this top a lot and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area i do not have a large chest and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort leveland it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath i dont prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the

this dress is stunning in person though the pictures do it no justice it was overall a very clingy fit im  with long legs and it was too short for me so i did not purchase but would recommend it for those with short legs
great top for day to night fine for work id think large breasted girls may find it too gaping for work as mentioned but b cup and below doesnt gape so very work appropriate
i was so excited to find this dress in the store i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty onwhat a disappointment the fabric is stunning but the fit is extremely voluminous  i am normally a small to medium so i grabbed a smallthe only way to describe this dress is tentlike  it was huge from the waist down i dont think i could size to an xs because i am a  and the top half of the dress fit perfect  i was sad to leave the store without this dress
this is my third top from this designer and normally i wear a small but i tried this on in the store and the medium fit much better on me i am not partial to the black as the knot design was lost but the sapphire is wonderful works great with slacks or more casual clothes i liked the sleeve length as well im not too busty but i think that other reviews comments of the knot being see through could be a problem
i tried this on in a different retailer a couple of weeks ago tried on a different one last nightsame size and it looked baggy sleeves way too long etc  let me add that i am usually a xss petite but some regular extra smalls will work also  this was a xs reg  even the sa could see that one looked like it fit smaller  i showed her the photo in my phone while this one swallowed me  bottom line you will need to try this one on as the sizes seem to vary
i love this dress be warned that even at  it is right on the edge of the shortest length that i can get away with wearing i probably will not wear it to church but for a special event dinner or the theater it will be an eye catching statement piece without being over the top it has a quiet appeal both layers of fabric are thin but that helps it to conform to my figure without hugging it it softly drapes showing an hourglass while being extremely comfortable i think some reviewers int
this dress is beautiful this is a  and tts it was not clingy or tight at all   it is fully lined and i have short legs so it was not too short for me if you have an event you could wear this to this summer i highly recommend
i have a few pairs of the stevie ankle so i thought i try these they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist the distressing near the front pockets is really apparentlike white stripes they make the jean look overall cheap not worth  in my opinion

i love this dress   i believe the picture online doesnt show the unique pattern and design   it does have an interesting design    add a long vest statement necklace and boots  you will be quite fashionable
love this top i was worried it would plunge too deep especially because im quite flat chested  but it is perfect i think it would look gorgeous on a volumptuous woman too thats the beauty of it and the color is my absolute favorite right now  
id hoped these would be cozy and warm the fabric is thin and slinky it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll couldnt wait to get them off just horrible and that price is very steep cant recommend
i love this shirt i would recommend an undershirt
these are the most flattering pair of white jeans i have ever found people stop me when i wear them and ask me where i purchased them and the name of the brand flattering comfortable and perfect for a casual weekend or going out highly recommend
i love the idea of this top its made really well the only issue is its a bit shorter than i thought and the neckline rubs on my neck
"this sweater just arrived in my mailbox and its already my favorite piece of clothing it is the softest thing i own and it feels so luxe as the reviewer below noted yes it has pockets they are slitstyle pockets probably why you cant see them in the photo and the opening is trimmed with the same cable detail featured on the front of the sweaterim also a professor but i still get mistaken for a grad student so i dont mind appearing professorialill probably wear this to th"
tried this in store today and id say it is exactly as pictured length is similar on me at  colors as shown cut is loose but not overly sacklike my normal size s fit loosely but not in an unflattering way sizing down might have been too narrow in the shoulders the embroidery seemed to be good quality but the fabric itself was on the thinner side with no lining i would have liked to see a liner at this price and probably would have bought but i think ill wait for a promo or sale
first of all i need to state that i am  i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with upon opening the parcel it seemed bigger than i expected the knit is very chunky not a bad thing but thicker than i expected the fit was way too large for me the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame i think if i c
bought this to wear to desert trip this weekend when we see the stones dylan mccartney who roger walters and neil young think its the perfect outfit as it definitely has an  feel now if only i had a pair of brown or teal boots it would be perfect ill keep hunting

i love this dress i think the cut fabric and embroidery are all flattering this dress is comfortable and can be dressed up or down i am  and weigh anywhere from  lbs i at first tried on the xxs petite and liked the look but found it to be tight in the arm area they didnt have an xs petite so i tried on the s petite to see if there was any major difference there totally was so i ordered the xs petite online and cant wait to get it
i ordered this in two sizes and have only received one so far but i think i really like it that said the one i got weirdly has pockets not shown in the images which makes it seems more professorial than id prefer partly because i am a professor and dont want to dress like one if i can help it that said i really need a floppy easy cardigan and this might well be it
this top is adorable but is shorter than the  inches they say i bought an xxs and mine measures  inches in the front and  inches in the back still cute if u dont mind shorter tops
i ordered this on line first but i really recommend getting to a store to look at them closely due to the fact that the first dress the embroidered lines were not sewn level on the bottom horizontal stripe areas and the fact that they didnt meet made me feel it wasnt worth anywhere near the price i feel you can sort of see this in the stock photo although it may be just the way its hanging also many of the center areas of the embroidered flowers and designs have a loose unfinished th

i just love this top it has a flattering cut fun summer colors i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down perfect for traveling only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back highly recommend stock more pieces like this retailer
i bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding and couldnt be happier im very curvy  and the medium fit like a glove the fabric has a great  vibe while the fit is extremely classic i have never felt more beautiful and received many compliments i am  and it hit just to the top of my feet i highly recommend
i bought this dress to wear at a wedding i am short so i would have really loved the petite but they were sold out both online and in store when i bought it im making do with high heels the sheen is gorgeous and the dress is very comfortable over all id also add that im pretty curvy and the cut fits my body perfectly
this dress is beautiful on so many levels the colors and print are amazing and the maxi sweater dress idea is unique it fits true to size and is very flattering my only issue is the amount of shine that it has from the metallic threads running through it i would have preferred less shine which would make the dress more versatile
i wanted to love this shirt so much i got this as a gift for christmas in the black the first time i wore the shirt  of the buttons on the back fell off keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem but i wanted to give the fair warning
i tried this on at the store and though it was pretty i was a little underwhelmed it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea but the quality was not great  they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking the idea of the top was better than the execution

very cool dress very true to sizefits just right in the top the fabric is just rightnot too heavy but opaque enough to cover everything that needs covering only issue is that it is loooong looking at the other reviews i think there may be some variation in the length of each individual dress i am   and this dress pooled around my feet size m i will be taking it to the tailor to have at least  trimmed off the hem i would recommend erring on the side of the petite sizing or fa

hello i could not see how this dress could get anything but a  star review  the only thing that i thought would be a negative is that it may stag easily other than that this dress is stunning on and i feel it runs large  i wear a sz  and the xs fit just right im   tall looks great with a high heel since its really long to the floor which i like as far as the shine on this dress i love it it makes it worth the price and dresses up a casual dress  and its very comfortable 
i broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress twice helped by sale price with additional percent off promo its mainly the irresistible print i bought it in both the lovely bluepink floral and the patterned red love it works best when the weather is in upper  with tights and boots but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders so dont size down i do wish the fabric was not
"i debated getting this dress for over a month and finally purchased it on retailer member day for  i wore it on a chiller night with a denim jacket and booties for a more casual feel constant compliments from friends and strangers only complaint about the dress is the slit it does not go as high like on the model stops right at the kneethe cross over is not too revealing which is nice overall the fit is great im  and usually size  and  the large was perfect"
this top is true to size for me im   and i ordered both a size  and  the six was too big i could tell because the shoulder seem was in the wrong spot and i couldnt lift my arms the shoulder seem hung too low the  was perfect i had full range of motion for my arms and was easily able to bend down and touch my toes without any pulling on the buttons of the shirt i always order a small or size  in tops the bigger size didnt add any length in front just added a boxier feel

this sweatshirt is beautiful and a step beyond the ordinary the white is crisp and the lace is just beautiful the black striping is subtle and really attractive i had a problem with the fit it just grabbed my mid section in an unattractive way i wear large in more fitted items and thats what i ordered this time im well endowed and it fit nicely over my bust shoulders and arms so afraid the next size up will be too big although it didnt work for me i highly recommend this beautiful top
"love this top its a  cotton and looks amazing with jeans you should consider ordering a size up i am usually an   and  tried the  in store it just didnt feel right the size  fit just rightlove the shirt and got tons of complement"
bought this dress for engagement photos and was a little worried about sizing but when i got it it fit perfectly and was very comfortable it runs true to size my only complaint is that there was a missing button on the sleeve but because there was an extra it was easily fixed definitely recommend
i love rifle paper and when i saw this dress online i knew that i had to have it this dress is even prettier in person than it is in the picture its pretty and delicate and can easily be dressed up or down i found this dress to fit true to size it definitely has that baby doll dress fit to it but i love it this is a dress that ill feel beautiful in and pull out of my closet over and over again
stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily loved the look so bought it anyway lost  buttons on the first wear it did not feel snug on me but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better either way i will return or exchange
i feel like im cheating when i put this on its so comfy almost like wearing cozy pjs but with my black belt and boots and a cute scarf i can easily wine and dine looking like a million bucks and feeling like im lounging at the same time i wish this came in more colors
"i ordered this in xl and the fit on me matches the fit on the model its meant to be loose  flowy so i think its true to size everything matches the photosthe sleeve length hem neckline etc its not a slimming look but doesnt make me look bigger than i am eitherthe material is a very soft cotton the pattern of the lace on the top portion is very pretty there are sequins mixed with the embroidery on the sleeves the thread they used for those cutout areas is soft its washed well"
"sctrachy short boxy stiffloved the idea of this sweater but this was not what i was hoping for"
material is heavier so maybe not for summer months but fit  feel great love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for active wear
i was pleasantly surprised by how well this dress skims over the body definitely needs the belt that comes with the dress to add some shape the color is gorgeous great print and very light fabric  perfect for summer
beautiful maxi fits tts i normally wear a  and took a  it is flattering to the waist and makes me feel girly the colors are so beautiful and the length is good for my  frame
i just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it however it does not have lined cups like it says no boob support whatsoever though i think the pattern distracts enough that im keeping it anyways  i do think it might be too short for a taller person im only  and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me and i dont think big boobs are the reason also it is pretty cheeky which it does mention maybe a little expensive but i did use a coupon

"note the sleeves on the model that is how your regular size will fit your arms however even if you have skinny arms like i do the sleeves will be tight i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only  ft  ini advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon"
this is a great top soft and cozy fabric nice and sturdy feeling its heavier than i though itd be so its perfect for the cooler days of spring and even a chilly summer night i love that its long enough in the front for me to feel comfortable wearing leggings the body is nice and roomy but the arms are a little snug however i like that because i think it makes it look less like a slubby sweatshirt the best part it can be cleaned in the washer and drier thrilled with this purchase

i like it a lot  very soft just enough detail to keep it interesting but still a classic look i got this in a small and its a little short on me compared to the model im  longwaisted  small side  carry bulk of my weight in legsso trim on top i will keep the small but also get a medium the small ties a little high and i also want a sweater that can cover my shirt tails when i dont tuck them in i got it in black so cant comment on the orange or red
"this is a very nice turtleneck the variations in the ribbing are a modern and flattering touch in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations  fyi there are not all the ribbing areas are the same shade of blackunless you are very small framed i would recommend sizing up or if you typically wear a m or a l go with the l as reference i have wide shoulders wider than my hips large biceps and a  chest and i went with the l because"
what a nice sweater i just received this in the gray and i think it is one of the most flattering sweaters ive gotten in a long time the fit is true to size the sleeves are very long and tight halfway to the elbows and fit well in the upper arms the stitching on the body gives an illusion of height and is slenderizing the weight is perfect for every season i am very happy with everything about this sweater
"i feel that for this price i should love this top and i wanted to however the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top and there were a few things about it that could be improvedpros i ordered a medium and feel that its pretty true to size additionally the fabric is nice and light but also sheer and generally speaking has a nice pattern overall its a very pretty topcons theres a cute crisscross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly"

"i like this robe a lot the tassel detailing on the ties is beautiful i like the soft interiorbut wish it went all the way down the arms the cozy part of the robe is only in the center section and hoodthe arms can be a bit chilly while the rest of you is warm and cozyi do not think the robe is necessarily flattering in that it does not do me favors in the way of slimming it is more of a cozyaroundthehouse robe rather than one to hide lingerie underneath"
what an adorable classic style fringed top this is i recently purchased this in my regular size but i shouldve read the reviews first and ordered a size up when i went up from a size  to an   it fit me perfectly and looks so cute on i think this one feels well made and i love the little details of the beads and how the fringe is placed it looks very flapper girl i bought this on sale in the pink color and cannot wait until spring and summer to wear with jeans or a skirt
these pants are fabulous the flow and feel made my mind up easily to purchase these i have a long torso and short muscular legs the style complimented by body type being culottes the hem should probably fall higher up on my legs i will probably have them hemmed the pleat has a nice kick to it now off to find the right pair of shoes

i have been looking for a tan color skirt so i ordered this as soon as i saw it so glad i did the deep camel color can still be worn in late summer as styled in the product photos and transition to fall staple the material is nice weight  and has a stretch the cut has a little  vibe that i love i think it should keep its shape hopefully launders well i think it runs slightly large as my waist is large in comparison to my hip proportion and there is no pinch for me i will rebuy this

i am  curvy and wear a size  and these pants look amazing often i struggle with wide keg pants bc they make me look short and plump however the material is buttery soft and hang in an elegant way and most important they are quite flattering even if you dont think culottes will work for your body type i suggest you give these a try

i ordered this in a petite im   waist  hips and size  fits perfectly and it fits very well everywhere however i think if youre bigger than  size up because this top is very fitted around the bust the bottom hem falls right below my belly button the neckline is not too low and not too high i chose black because i feel that there are a lot of details and can be toned down with a darker color i think this top must be fitted for a tailored look or otherwise one may risk t

fabric is a little thinner than i expected but just wore a camisole the waist is a little short nice batiklike pattern and feel
just received the bra and matching panty in the mail and loved it the true color is a little darker i would call it a taupe the fabric is really nice i am a  c and ordered a medium just from my freepeople bra experiences and they run small the medium is perfect for my size i usually order a small panty and this one fits it looks smaller than pictured on the model this set is one of a kind the pattern on fabric is really beautiful i think it is worth the price if you like lingerie
i ordered the white in this i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos i dont think they do this piece justice i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered i found it fit true to size love the three ties in the back its a tad baggy but looks great i can see that this might snag easily though
i wanted so badly to love this sweater the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm but it does not fit me in a flattering way i cant recommend a size because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers and the sweater slides across my shoulders im  it appeared overstretched and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth
absolutely love this top yes it runs big and is flowy but i think it is very flattering especially with skinny jeans loved it so much i bought the navy and wine colors for myself and the green for my mom for reference im   lbs  and the xs fit well falls just above my mid thigh
"im glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing  i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly i love the taupe color  its feminine not overtly so and i can still use it as a neutral the quality is really quite good though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories without smooth edges away from the fabric its also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia"

i ordered this a little big because the smallest size that they had was a medium i probably could have gone with a small but given that i am a  on top and  a size  on the bottom    the medium fits me just fine it is super soft and you can wear it with just about anything keep in mind that your midriff may show a bit depending on how high your bottoms are however i paired it with a white pair of skinny jeans with a cute belt so a teeny bit of my midriff was showing at time
i liked the look of this online but its even nicer in person just the right length on the hips a medium weight and with enough interest and exposure on the shoulders to make it feel like a stylish option for a slightly cool night without falling into the tooheavy and makesyoufeeldumpy category of sweater like the slightly short sleeves too
i feel in love with this shirt online and purchased it right away this is one of the those pieces that makes retailer my favorite place to shop stylish unique and beautiful it is a bit full in the bottom so i sized down from my normal s to xs and am very pleased
this dress is a fun idea but the one i received had misaligned pleating so a few of the rows of sequins were tucked into the pleat it threw the lines of the dress off i ended up returning it but i think it can be amazing if you get one that looks like th stock photo

love this sweater for so many reasons fits true to size unique in design versatile soft and so easy to wear ive worn it tied in the back and front it goes great with a skirt or dress pants for work date night and elevates the look with any of my jeans i love haying clothes i can get the most out of highly recommend this sweater
this top is very nice i ordered it in black it looked very good the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look the fabric however feels like heavy cotton it didnt feel very soft and comfortable it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton while i think this will retain its shape and not stretch like softer cotton i am sending it back it felt a bit heavy to wear

this top fits tts as shown on model loose flowy but the cutdetailsflounce still give some nice shape i usually take a s or m at retailer depending on the stylemake went with the small in this i am  shoulders ruler shape  no gaping in the front fits gracefully flows with details that are classic and add the wow factor to this social or work appropriate top so complimentary it would flatter many body types the neckline is juuuuussst right i fasten the top button to make
so simple to throw on with jeans or you could dress it up the ruffles give it a little extra flair nice and soft really comfy i havent decided which size i am going to hold onto i ordered in a small and a medium small fits me great and i am usually a pretty standard medium i think it just depends on what look you are going for  wish they had it in a lighter color like an ivory or pink  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade

i think this dress is my favorite purchase this whole year it fits like a dream i saw it in the store while it was full price and tried on an  the only size they had left i typically wear a  or  in dresses but the  was quite large so i passed after it went on sale i ordered a  with my fingers crossed glad i ordered when i did as they sold out fast fabric is a nice substantial weight great for fall the fit is great not tight at all and more of an aline on me which is weird
i typically wear a  in jeans and in these i got the  and they fit perfectly i ordered the  because i wanted a more fitted look and that was what i got they are well made a nice dark wash and with the size  a more straight fit and not boyfriend fit im only  so they come a little past my ankle when unrolled ive worn them two days in a row and they havent stretched outhighly recommend
i love love love this top it is beautiful and very unique the first day i wore it i got so many compliments highly recommend
im wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways its a little long in the back because im short but overall i enjoy wearing it its comfortable casual girly and well made im happy with it
this blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack living in la its  degrees one day and  the next the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate it runs true to size and is very comfy thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner
i do not think i could express how much i love this top it is so flattering and soft i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top it is stretchy which for me is a wonderful thing i purchased the day it came in store it is quickly prone to pilling though with the style of shirt its not so bad but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost 
i feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it and while it is lovely well made and very pretty and delicatei just didnt feel like it was anything special if you dont have a blouse like this then it is a great find but it is nothing super out of the ordinary fit i feel is ttsi am in between a m and li ordered the l lots of room in the body although i didnt like where the arms hit on me they arent wrist length but they arent midfore

i found this skirt in a size  at my local retailer store i admired it on the website but to see and feel it in person was very appealing i tried it on and it fit beautifully a style that looks great on my figure i love the mohair weave of the color block sections the negative is this skirt is really pricy but i had my birthday discount and since the size  was sold out online and this skirt must have been a return the chances of it going on sale in a size  were very slim i am still admirin
the top on the model in the photo is a true ivory but the top in reality is more beige well im blonde with fair skin so im not sure this is going to work it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality  i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy  but in reality with it really being beige having pleats everywhere and being a crinkly fabric it looks more casual i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts
finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky these fit the bill not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are  i instantly knew that i had to have these look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived i sized down a size and the fit is perfect highly recommend

now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points  great fit flattering silhouette comfortable fabric shape enhancing cut and the easiest casual style ever  i got the  and my body is   
this anorak is perfection perfect weight color and the style is super easy to wear i found this to fit true to size and not oversized at all im    with an average buildframe and i took a size small i can comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt underneath or even a thin sweater i think xs would have been too tight in the shouldersbust it fits perfectly and i love the inner drawstrings that you can pull to give it a little more shape i got this during the  off promo
i like this top it went well with my olive pant i tried in l and xl l was a tad fitted around my tummy xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just didnt work i am busty perhaps it may work better for a slender frame i recommend this top because it is pretty but the fit is selective so its best to try out a couple of sizes first
i tried on this skirt in stores and loved it the only thing is im usually a  or a  and had to buy a  for reference im   and about  pounds if you want to tuck a light sweater or really anything in id recommend you go up a size as well
this is a great casual skirt i ordered the  or xs petite and it fit perfectly both colors are nice i dont think i could choose though i do have a taupe skirt so leaning towards the slate color the fit is also flattering waist is snug but not tight the fabric is soft could wear in the fall or even winter with tights i recommend  lbs  in waist

like most of the other reviewers i agree this skirt runs quite small i had to size up  sizes the waist is quite small but there are parts that are elasticized nicely hidden and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie i think it will work nicely year round too
nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesnt fall well also as has happened to me before retailer sent me a dress clearly wornused and returned by someone else with hair all over it you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out
the fabric at the trim and shoulders is crepe which isnt clear from the photo much nicer in person than online runs large i wear a large in knit tops  and to hide a soft belly but this large was too big armholes showed my bra and it was rather wide and boxy ill exchange for a m because i think ill get a lot of use out of it this summer a casual tank with a little spunk cute
definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt just too large too much fabric for me im usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod i wouldnt have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top i think the colors are also a bit duller in person love the concept though
this is a good basic casual skirt and the grayish color is a great neutral i saw it in store just kind of hanging by itself and decided to try it on i usually wear a  in skirts but always have to size up in hd so i grabbed an  which fit well i will say its definitely a little snug though even sizing up the fabric is soft and flowy and will work well for both late summer and early fall id recommend it
really pretty top very different colors and style  nothing like anything i have delivered in timely manner highly recommend
saw this in my local and retailer store and had to have it well made and easy to dress up for down perfect with a light weight shirt tucked in for summer and early fall i recommend sizing up one size
i absolutely love the look of this shirt with the built in layering piece the overall garment is lightweight and not too heavy even with the added layer however this runs really large in general this brand runs large for me and i would say that if you are used to this brand you can stick with your normal sizing for this brand however compared to other brands it runs very large i think it would work fantastic for me in a different size it is not at all fitting so it would be more like a
such a cute skirt it has a touch of whimsy with this tropical flare that makes me feel pretty it fits well and it is true to size
skirt fits true to size i bought a regular size  even though im only  feet because i didnt want it too short the size was perfect as it hit right above the knee bold vibrant color and great quality also very unique which is what i look for at ahtro recommend give it a shot
this skirt material and quality is top notch im not a mustard yellow fan but the color combo in this is just stunning im    usually and picked a  in this which would have been correct the top bad is very thick so it was just too much at my waist in the modeling pick she is covering about half the band with her tied tank top this would look beautiful on anyone approx  or over i think oh and the drape is beautiful not super full
with a skirt so vibrant its hard not to feel happy wearing it i tried this on in store following a spring fashion show while i usually need petite sizes for lengthproportion purposes im  slender build the regular size  was a great fit and length any shorter and it may have taken a bit of the elegance away from the skirt and i dont necessarily mind a shorter length but this was beautiful as it was the price is a bit steep but the quality of the material justifies it the one

i got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love itit is such a good idea and i loved it on the model however it failed in translation for me and i will be returning the bottom of the top is very loose but the top clings to my chest  pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides not worth exchanging for a large since the bottom of the top is already to loose
this is a beautiful sweatshirt that is a sentence ive never said before mine arrived with the sleeves rolled up which made me think they probably pulled it off a mannequin or something it made the sleeves sort of loose at the bottom so i am hoping that they will draw up a little once i wash it kind of bummed about that for almost  they could have at least steamed it out or something so i could see the authentic fit the sweatshirt is a little more squarefitting than it looks in t
dont judge the sweater by the model its an unattractive ensemble the sweater is very pretty on its lightweight with a cute design on the back i wear with skinny jeans or leggings it runs a bit wide at shoulders but im petite so it could just be me also it says dry clean i think but i put in a mesh bag and washed on delicate cycle by itself then laid flat to dry and it was fine
i so wanted to love this sweatshirt it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material the pattern is pretty and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it unfortunately the body of the sweatshirt particularly the front torso area was too big and it popped out around me like a balloon the arms fit well so i dont think that i could have gone down a size i was also not keen on the way the neck hung which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded
love the knit contrast stitches add interest quality is great and it is true to size very happy i made this purchase especially because i caught it on sale after eyeing it for months great with denim or a black dress
this is a super cute tank fits good flowy and airy which is exactly what i had in mind for summer fits good
i was really excited for this sweater its not terrible but its not great the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it i would try a different sweater
just grabbed this today great find i paired it with a white blouse with blue polka dotswill pair with anything though with great neutral colors white or blue jean jackets sweatersthe skirt has a little stretch for my hourglass figure but would work with any type body i think a many season skirt perfect for traveling
im not sure how i feel about this shirt i love the fabric which is soft lightweight and richly colored the polka dot trim is quirky and fun and i like the idea of the twisted hem the cut is generous in width for sure i ended up ordering a small because i swam in my usual mediumtolarge sizes but the length of the small barely works the sleeves are juuuust long enough and the shirt hits me just at the hip not nearly as far down as the model shots show it may be because im busty a

my  daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between  and   this dress was sloppy on every one of us i dont think a size x small would have made a difference the length is all over the place im not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture on the positive side was very soft it may work as a beach cover up
this is a gorgeous buttondown the colors are stunning  i love the mix of blue and brown the fabric is super soft and drapes just right i feel the this shirt runs true to size im an xxs petite and it fit perfect this one is a winner
"got this top in the blueorange plaid its super cute and i love the style much better than your typical straight button down plans shirti highly recommend it"
i feel in love with this piece the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments it lifted my mood just wearing it sadly ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear so sad they should recreate this in a heavy fabric
i didnt realize when i ordered that the hem is unfinished below the seam im not a fan of this look especially in a more expensive skirt the fabric is nice and flowy but i do feel there is maybe too much of itwhich may be a plus if you wanted a fuller skirt and that the waist runs slightly small i am normally a  and ordered the large and it fit at my natural waist rather than hanging lower and looser like other styles in this shape i am  and i do like fuller skirts but was

it is soft and hangs great problem  i wore it one time  and the back balled up terrible it looked like i had owned it for years  not worn it one time wouldnt recommend though it is sooooo soft
"this sweater is exactly what you think it is comfy it doesnt have much shape its pretty boxy but thats the point its not one of those figure flattering kind but its also not shabby looking its so darn comfortable and soft and the colors are so upbeat and beautiful since its a fuzzy yarn type of fabric i think the fuzz might start to fall out eventually and i have to be careful not to snag anything on it because i dont want to pull the knitting loose other t"

i have a few pair of charlies and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit i own this pair in both the orange and gray bought both in my normal  they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on dont size up definitely recommend these pants
i like the pattern and material on this top but the bubble hem isnt flattering on my figure i would recommend this top if you are tiny and petite
i love charlie pants ive bought a few in the past and ive never been disappointed with quality style or fit i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result i wish more pants were side zip so much more flattering i got these in a  my usual size and the fit is perfect i also got these in the regular rather than petite but the length works just fine for my height i bought these in the grey stripe but like them so much i think ill order another pair in the orange
material is kind of thick stretchy the orange i ordered was just too bright for me im  and got the  i think the  wouldve worked better sending back mostly bc the color didnt look good on me
after reading the reviews stating that this dress was a tent and only fit for the tall and small chested i kind of had a battle of wills in my head over ordering it it is very me but me is also  curvy and possessing a  bust i had to post a review because i received the dress today and i actually love it i ordered a  and i love the fit i know its flowy but on me its far from tentlike i think its great now as a prefall piece with some sandals and a jean jacket and as
i really want to love this dress the style and colors are so nice and easy i like the loose flowy feel of the dress it runs a tad large but that is part of the style what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress also it has lining which is nice for modesty but with the stiffitchy factor mixed with lining it feels a bit cumbersome i havent decided if i will k
a perfectly fun pant for a gray or sunny winter day i like the longer length to the ankle on me pairing with my kate spade black sabina combat boots and a eileen fisher black cashmere boxy cropped sweater another fun option is to pull out the pink accent in the pant with a pink camisole under a black sweater the fabric weight is good for winter they do feel a little itchy at first but its not noticeable after wearing them a short while
"i love jumpsuits for their style and comfort i loved the look of this blue silky piece and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house i agree that it is like lounge wear but for me there were a few challengesfirst the fit was small i am usually anywhere between a  and a  depending on style cut and brand i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th"
my stylist didnt love them they are well made the waist line is comfortable and the embroidery is very pretty the hem is loosefitting perhaps that is what she thought was not as flattering the material is airy nice for summer i think you should give these a try for me perhaps it is my muscular legs that made her hesitate
when i received this dress i was surprised by the weight of the fabric its not as light and gauzy as the photos appear and it is fully lined its more substantial in a good way also i had thought it would be more of a straight cut but its definitely a swing which i prefer with the lining it does stand out a bit from your body so its not a clingy look at all i like it a lot but i dont think it fits the way you would expect from the photo its roomy i could probably have sized down i
i found this dress to be a perfect flowy fit for the superhot tail end of summer this definitely is not a form fitting dress but i bought my regular size medium size  and think it fits perfectly i have a pretty small chest and find that sometimes these aline dresses look better if you dont have a lot on top making them tent out just my opinion personally do not think it has an abundance of fabric in fact it is a lot less roomy than a lot of others in this cut due to the embroidery

i bought these to go with the boiled wool jacket that is also currently on sale i have several pairs of charlie trousers and i really like the brand these are in a thicker winter fabric and i understand why the other reviews found them itchy i dont find that bothersome but the texture is a bit different the quality is typical for charlies the color stripe is a metallic bronze but could look pink in the right light the fabric is noticeably stretchyi think without that stretch these
i was so excited to get this topbut its boxy and a little itchy from the design i just didnt think it was worth the hefty price im normally a small in retailer clothing
i completely agree with the other reviewers this top is easy to throw on with jeans or trousers and so comfy im  with a  chest and i ordered in my normal medium which looks fantastic and if i wanted to i think i could have sized down for a more form flattering look but i love the ease of this top
just bought this in the store a couple days ago and wore it for the first time today love the embroidery detail and i feel that the colors are more vibrant in person i typically wear a  in most retailer tops but i got a  in this and it is great  seems to be a generous fit the slits on the sides do come up a bit high but i wore a cami underneath since it is sheer and the slits were not an issue with it looks great with jeans it is a great transitional piece for the fall as im sure i will
i bought this dress on super sale and it was such a great deal sadly its going back although i sized down i still feel like the dress is shapeless and tent like no wonder why the store had so many still at the price i paid the details on the dress are pretty and its high quality just wish the fit was better
i usually wear size  for dress but this is the first time ever i have to go down to size  and it fits perfectly well made maybe a bit stiff around armholes nothing major i love the length as i dont like to show my knees great color combinations although this supposed to be a summer dress it looks great for fall just need to add a jacket a pair of boots and im good to go feeling pretty
i did purchase the pants but ultimately ended up returning because everything such as the print and the length it hits at your ankles is great but there was at least for me a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area and this is not to be crude there really isnt another word that i can use and when you sat down it is extremely apparent i am  and run between a size  and  and  fit me but again i just think if there was less fabric in the saddle it wouldnt ride up and look more fl
"love love love this silk dress i feel classic retailer is back perfect for hot and steamy summer daysjust a few photos of the back which has the belt band sewn in kind of high so that it can be wrapped through the side loops grecian style for some reason in the online back photo the model is wearing the dress backwards im  currently  or  hips narrow shoulders and torso bra size  i tried on the size  regular which is the only one i found in the s"
this dress is fantastic  i cant help but think the other gals who gave this a low rating were perhaps more petite and didnt size down  i am  and usually a   purchased the  and it is great  fits wonderful and looks so nice for the price  i like clothing that doesnt touch me and this does a great job without looking sloppy
i do not know if this item is worth the full price but i love it very soft good length and comfortable to wear the stripes are a perfect width so as not to be overpowering the fabric design is unique and i think the weave added to the cost of production for many it may not be worth the cost but i am glad i purchased this top it is not a sheer fabric try it on if you see it in the store
such a great classic top very flattering can be worn all year i bought it in grey but think ill need it in other colors
love the rushed sleeves and the flower pattern on the side t shirt is however a little thin hence a bit sheer but i loved it nonetheless i saw the loose fit and decided ot order a size down xxs petite ad it is so flattering going to keep it as i dont think petite is going to make it to sale i think it will look very cute with my denim pencil skirt jeans or other pants for casual days

this top arrived today and after trying it on i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is  without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture the fit is designed to be loose so i dont think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down ive included a picture of how it fits naturally and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back its still a cute shirt just not the flattering top i was expecting im debating on
i really like this top while it looks somewhat like just a tshirt it is not the fabric is light and soft it has a great texture feel it dioes not feel like a regular cotton shirt the print is lovely i am very pleased

i like this top and while it doesnt look on me like it does the model i think it will be good for work purposes would say it runs big and does have the maternity look risk i bought this two months postpartum so i need tops that cover the post baby belly and this works for that purpose the grey is nice bought on sale but wouldnt recommend paying full price

i like this shirt because it can be worn for dressy or casual i like the weight although i wish it was just a tad less seethrough i can get by without wearing a tank under but i usually feel like i have to wear one i like the link i feel like it runs just a little large i love the length of the sleeves and the detailcut of the sleeve i like the colors on the shirt too its a good versatile addition to my wardrobe

"i bought the pink one i like this salmon pink color not too girly type of pinkthe material is super soft and light i have skinny torso so it looks really nice on me not showing thin bodythe only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash it shrunk one size when i bought it size s it covered my flat hips fits just like the picture but now my hips are showing i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold  air dry"
i was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying maternityand this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing its not that it runs big its supposed to swingflow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because its a little thicker fabric so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut but i lov

the shirt is nice but not as nice a material as i was hoping but i kept it anyway but after washing it it is even more disappointing not very soft and now kind of an odd length hopefully it will grow on me but wouldnt recommend it especially for the price
i tried the neutral motif one on when it first came out i didnt buy but it stayed on my mind bc the colors were so pretty i got it at sale on sale and am so happy i did it is sheer but i think it would work fine in a casual setting without a tank as long as you have a skin tone bra great buy and tts

i have worn this beautiful and super comfy top a number of times since i purchased it it can be casual or add a long necklace and dress it up super versatile
i have been looking for a soft turtleneck that can be my togo piece in the cold weather this fits the bill as far as the material goes the material used is very soft and even though it seems light in weight it is actually very warm and not see through at all i like the feel of this top it would be pretty accurate to say that it feels as if i am wearing a blanket around me it is that comfy however the one detail about this top that i am unsure about is the cut it is very boxy to the e
this blouse has a nice casual feel with feminine lines and the swingy design is flattering
love the feel and comfort
i am very happy with my purchase it is a great sweater very easy to wear and cute i am very sensitive to scratchy wool products and this one is very soft i highly recommend it
i love the dress  i purchased this dress to wear on my honeymoon to paris  it made me feel like a princess walking around the gardens of versalles while wearing it
the fit of these jeans are so great they look syllish and feel great at the same time this brand does a fabulous job of creating a jean that feels like you can wear them dressed up and casual a
this dress is really pretty but not made for girls with hips i tried on my usual size  and it fit everywhere but was just slightly too tight in the bum for me to feel comfortable but i feel like i would have been swimming everywhere else in the dress in an  typical of shifts i guess but a girls can dream if you are a straighter shape though i would highly recommend

this sweater is extremely roomy the cut is very wide  wider than it is long the sleeves are dolman style and the neck is a little loose with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasnt wearing a tent but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin if you can im keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because im exploring funky town lately join me at your own risk
this was my first shot at highrise bottoms and i love them the fit is very flattering and the print is adorable i just bought the bottoms so i cant comment on the top it looked a bit small for my bust so i am purchasing a solid colored top to match
i ordered my normal size  in this dress and could barely get it on it runs very small i would suggest going up a size or maybe even two sizes up
comfortable thick material  think structured sweatshirt material easy to throw on and look as if effort was made  when it wasnt sizing im between a large and xl usually large was perfect im tall and curvy   curvy and this cardigan belted jacketis very flattering
i am so in love with this dress i think it is made of high quality fabric and very well designed i am  about   and the  fit perfectly i bought it for my upcoming bridal shower and could not be more excited to wear it
i like the retro look but these seem to run large to me  i get they are ruched on the sides  yet the bottom has a saggy look  i got the large but i feel like i should have gotten the medium to fill out the bottom i already took the strip out and washed so im keeping them  very cute with a bikini top  maybe i just need a bigger butt
ive been waiting for this dress to come back in stock and when it finally did i got it in the size  im typically a  or  in dresses and the  fits perfect for reference im    i think it runs on a larger size because its a shift dress i would recommend sizing down a great white dress to wear to my rehearsal dinner

this dress is a staple if you dont feel like getting too dressed up and want to be comfortable this is it will be great for travel as well i like to pack light so i look forward to traveling with this dress
this shirt runs large in my opinion i wish i would have sized down to a xs but maybe it will shrink a little when i wash it its a great shirt good quality and im very happy i got it
lovely dress that i recommend just not for those with my body type  im broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down  from the front everything is awesomefrom behind it was less flattering  made my flat bum look flatter  also the stripe patterns do not match at the break  other than that the quality is fantastic the fabric is a great transitional weight the fit is comfortable and the style is classic
good quality and design perfect for casual office definitely recommend i dont know why its called a cardigan because its more like a casual blazer note there is no button just the tie to close runs big im   ordered the xs and its roomy
i dont know what took me so long to pull the trigger on this itemprobably because it wasnt in my store for very long so i didnt try it on in person i decided to order this based upon the reviews and i was immediately obsessed this cardigan is magical i first wore it to work with black trousers and a plain crewneck tshirt underneath with a bib necklace and everybody in my office thought i was wearing the cutest blazer i had all the ladies come feel it to prove it in fact feels like a
really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different it fits tts but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress which is nice i am   pounds and the size  fit me perfectly
this was disappointing to me i love how this looks on the model unfortunately it made me look huge it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on i didnt find it was tts i am a  m and got the m it was too tight in the waist before id even put it on i noticed the waist looked very small i dont even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching its like the buttons didnt match up or something
this shirt is cute i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine while still casual it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely the only issue is that the seampleat that runs down the middle is off center i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying
i read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size  and  im normally an  or  and the  fit perfectly dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since its so beautiful the bell sleeves are really cute i highly recommend the dress
i love this dress i am usually a size  but ordered this in size  and it fits perfect great for any season and can dress up or dress down the pink is the perfect shade  i feel like im elle woods
i bought this stylish and cozy sweater in ivory i find that cable knit sweaters tend to add bulk but this sweater creates a long lean look it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans and the buttons on the cowl are a fun detail every time i wear this i get compliments on it
the cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didnt flatter my shape i think it would work better on someone very thin the crisscross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didnt sit right even worse the bust portion made me look flat and im a full c cup
i love this dress easy breezy flowy comfortable  pink fits a true medium would recommend to anyone makes me a little flirty
"this dress is awesome love everything about it except the colors the pink is ridiculous it is like pepto on crack theres no way outside of being a bridesmaid i would ever wear that shade of pink nauseating i would order the turquoise but i dont think i want that either plus the pink was the only color offered in the store even though i saw the dress offered in black online at one time why wouldnt you stock the black instore i can no longer get ityou need to offer this d"
i purchased this blouse in black love it this blouse goes with everything from jeans to work to cocktail it is perfect my only wish is that it came in a colors i would add navy red green white im tempted to purchase another one just so i never have to worry about the one i have wearing out buy it  you wont be sorry
always attracted to wool for its warmth and breathability this jacket has great style that can be casual or dressed up some its slightly more boxy then expected which i think lends to the casual look find myself wearing it a lot
this skirt is stunning like the other reviewer i believe this is probably the most beautiful thing in my closet the colors are just striking it is also flattering  i find some skirts can kind of pouf out around the hips and add bulk this one lays nice and flat and looks great the material is very soft and simple and i love the frayed edges at the bottom i am just between  and  and weigh  lbs i took an xs and it fits perfectly so it seems true to size only thing if you are
saw this in store today and had to have it the pink is a really bright pink  definitely more of a hot pink than it appears in the image online i am a solid  and i bought this in an  so it definitely runs a size large highly recommend
i purchased this in the ivory color and love it very comfortable and agree with reviewer who said it looks good with  button or  buttoned up my one complaint is that i found it to be such an open weave that i feel it necessary to wear a cami underneath which is not the end of the world the other issue i have the back is definitely longer than the front as pictured im not sure why retailer feels compelled to have almost every top they sell have this styling i dont think its necessary an

this sweater was exactly what i was looking forsomething well made cozy easy to just throw on and go and still look chic i am  and  lbs and the xsmall fit perfectly  still roomy but drapes well i got the taupe which is nice but i got the red color for my sister in law and its gorgeous more of a burnt orange than the red show here i would definitely recommend this sweater
"let me start off by saying that i really do like this sweater the texture is very nice and if it does start to pill the material is one where i dont think itll show up much the fabric is a little bumpy but still softim only giving it  stars because the sleeves could be  to  inches longer i bought this sweater in both the red and tan colors medium i liked it so much ive also never had a problem with long sleeve shirtssweaters from retailer having overly short sleeves however"
i wish this came in a petite size im going to do my best to add some stitches in the ruching to keep the middle taught im busty  ddd and the suit had plenty of coverage and lift i will need to make additional loops in the back latch but this piece is worth all the extra work i was surprised this worked so well for a short curvy figure i ordered a medium
i hesitated to purchase this dress because of the color but it is a beautiful deep pink that i think would work with all skin tones i ordered a size down as recommended by other reviewers and the dress fits perfectly the feel is amazing  incredibly comfortable and not too short when you lean over

"love this blouse per the previous review there was no problem with my tailoring it is exactly as shown i plan to handwash this and take super good care of it you can tell from the picture it could be an excellent wardrobe staple and absolutely timeless as well as the kind of sexy and elegant you can get away with in the officei do think it runs a tiny bit small however it is not short its just quite a fitted piece i would consider sizing up i love the look of the medium on me "
love this ordered it on sale but i really do think its worth full price i went with a small even though an extra small would have been good tooim slender and  about  with full bust the small fits similar to the model and because i wanted it to fit well in the sleeves i have long arms and length i went with the small maybe should have gone smaller as it is roomy its very well made and although youll need a cami i still feel as if it will be very cozy perfect for our mi

the light red color is so rich i would describe it as a burnt coralred i love the length  long enough to pair with leggings but not overwhelming in my  frame one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too
i do agree with others that the draping does sit a little funny but its nothing that a simple tack cant fix this suit looks incredible on and does a good job of hiding my mom pooch while still making me feel sexy with the cutouts also covers the chest area well
"i usually do not buy dresses at full price but when i saw the teal version of this dress on the website i caved in and bought it i had also tried the pink version of this dress in store its very cute and sweet but i dont think i can pull it off the teal version is pretty accurate in color to the on screen imagethis dress runs huge i usually wear a  or  in retailer dresses and went with a size  for this one it fits comfortably without being too baggy or like a tent the materi"
this top is so cute and i immediately had to purchase it when i saw it i am usually drawn to boxy cropped shirts but i find this is harder to wear than i anticipated it may be because i got a small size but it is boxier than i anticipated and is almost hard to wear with even jeans i recommend you buy because the detailing is so pretty and perfect but try on and make sure you have some good bottoms to pair it with
so this is a pricey tee but i ordered it on salestill pricey im really surprised how much i ended up loving it and wearing it ordered it in the light red size xs and it has become my go to tank for the summeri wear it every week the armholes are a tab long on me so i wear a black sports bra underneath and it does peak through but not in a tacky way if you dont mind the price i would pick this up
this top is fabulous the color is amazing and the back is just beautiful i would recommend this sweater to anyone i absolutely love it my only concern is getting it snagged on something other than that its a score
this is a simple shirt but so cool and comfortable in the hot florida summer im ordering one in the blue and white as well i know this is going to be a fave i love supima cotton and though i adore retailer i do wish theyd carry more of the supima rather than the nonorganic fabrics so many of the pretty things i simply will not buy because i prefer the feel of silk linen and cotton thanks for this one retailer
this is one of those very retailer tops that you cant find anywhere else the feel is folkloric but the country is not specific although listed as a tee the material is a knit with heft and is lined from the bust seam down the embroidery is combined with cutwork to give it a highend finish and justify the price this is a dressup tee for sure i will most likely treat it as a blouse and wear it with cropped black culottes or a slim midi skirt i wear either a  or  in mos
i bought this in the store and love it seeing it online  i would never think to buy it much more flattering in person
i usually take a small in retailer tops i did have to order this in a medium though because it is slightly more form fitting the material seems a little thin so i hope it holds up well over time i love the green color though i am curvy especially on the bottom and this was very flattering on me i do think it is too expensive for what it is especially with the material being thin even at sales price overall though i thought it flattering enough to keep
i really liked this top i wish it was not so sheer even with a nude bra its just too much its a very loose fit throughout the body but the shoulders arms and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top i just cant do something this sheer i feel too exposed i wish they had it offered in other colors
"love the color ordered the plum it is very nice in person not quite as burgundy more purpley i dont typically go for the plain dresses as i feel at the price it should be a statement but i dont have a dress like thiswearable as casual or dressed upsolid plain colorsoft fabriclong sleeves yet sexy enough without being too muchflirty it is on the shorter sidei decided to keep it as dolan makes a similar dress every year and i pass every year this is the year"
this is an ideal top  especially for summer so lightweight and soft the detailing is adorable and makes this simple shirt feel very special yet everyday i ordered the black and am back for the other colors this one is an absolute win
it is a little roomy so if youre between sizes go with the smaller i think its flattering even if you have a larger chest love the details and the fabric is a good weight and quality
just tried this dress on in the store and ordered a petite because im  if you are even  or taller i wouldnt recommend a petite fit unless you prefer the tunic length this dress and material has a flattering drape for those of us with trouble belly regions
the material on this dress is so soft and wonderfully drapey super flattering defines waist enough to not add bulk but also hide a tummy the purple color is lovely perfect for fall for reference im    lbs with hourglass figure
this dress is a new favorite the cut is great for most figures and the fabric has a nice drape around the curves of the body so it sort of has a slimming effect  which i love im petite and curvy and so the hem lands closer to top of my knees than it does on the model in the image the color in person is slightly more purple and less brownmaroon but it still works for a fallwinter wardrobe if you are uneasy about the colors i recommend looking at it in store before purchasing i love thi
i got this in black it can be casual or dressy very lightweight comfortable and flattering i collect black tops since i rarely wear any other color and this is now one of my favorites i think it looks totally different in the black than it does in the other colors  more refined less casual this runs quite large i am a  but needed the  in this top
the colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color size is a bit on the large size i did not feel that the jacket was that wellmade and would hold up to much wear i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans black pants etc and this did not fit that need it would be a warm jacket if that is a need
such a cute shirt i picked up the whitewithflowers that is not being shown online yet the straight white looks like it could wrinkle and definitely needs a tank underneath but the white with flowers was not seethrough and seems like it will require a bit less steaming the detail masks wrinkles  the flowereddesign also has a small tie at the neck that i dont think was on the solid color design cant totally remember  cute extra detail but not overly obvious it blends into the shirt
i am absolutely in love with this piece yes it runs large im usually a medium to large in vests ands the small fits me prefectly the quality is superb i love the feel of the faux fur i want to pet it and the snaps and hooks seem as if they will also last forever thank you tracy
im   lbs  and the xs fit perfectly very soft feminine top i got many compliments the first day i wore it wire it for business casual but looking forward to wearing it with flare jeans for a more  look highly recommend this great sale on a wonderful top
interestingly the description said this was blue but as it looks on the picture it is more grey that being said about the zippie love my stylist i brought it in for a try on session at my local store said you know how i feel about sweats i wont like it joke on her she turned around and was ok i shouldnt have looked love the ruffles at the bottomit makes this sweater much more special it is actually really cute for casual day jeans tshirt kids or over sweats any
love these shorts i purchased them in the peach color the color is perfect the fit is perfect they look great highly recommend
i love love this wide leg pants they feel beautiful on and fit like a glove i do think they run a bit small in the waist because they were a bit too tight in my regular size typically cloths are a little too large in the waist on me i have a curvyathletic figure as other reviewers stated they pants are long but they are great length for wedges otherwise i would recommend having the length tailored

this will be a cardigan i will wear across all seasons if you want to layer a button down or another long sleeve shirt under it i would suggest sizing up one size as soon as i put this on it felt like it molded to me its beautiful and comfortable
be aware that this cardigan runs small as you can see on the model its a formfitting style its not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece i would wear it more like a top with a buttonup front it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design im not wowed by it but its nice in a  kind of way
"i really wanted to love this waistcoat i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received itit runs large but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed the hip area  i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size its going back but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative "
this skirt is a great fit for curvy women i highly recommend it
"i really love the colors of this top especially in the pinky pastels it fits really well can be tied or untied and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts speaking of that i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer am i hiding a pregnancy feel to it butthe price tag  for a tank blouse is just too much for me i will save this one in my shopping bag and hope its still available once it goes on sa"

tla has another winner in my book i decided on the blue and thrilled with the tee its a soft blue almost light periwinkle fabric isnt so thin so it not see through thank goodness i actually love it so much im ordering the other color as well i absolutely would recommend this cute tee love love tla
i love this vest i think it is heavy for a warm springsummer day so kindve surprised it was featured at the store early spring i waited for it to go on sale and purchased my normal retailer size medium i agree it may seem big or loose fitting but i am a vest girl and the fit for me is perfect size  dd  lbs and  ft  in height it is a great finishing piece for causal or office attire this vest will definitely stay in my closet for a long time beautiful quality
im very surprised by the review given that said this was frumpy it it absolutely adorable and the classic plaid is timeless as first reviewer said the styling of this on the model does it no favors it is in reality form fitting but in a very flattering forgiving way the waist nips in nicely underneath the top section then flares out on the bottom section that bottom flare can sometimes add inchespounds but this top does it in a very modern subtle and flattering fashion and the mater
i wanted this top to fit i ordered a large and was swimming in it i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it i did not have trouble with it being cut too low i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist this print is soooo pretty
i wanted to love this dress it really has no style i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight had to return it
love this vest it does run large so definitely size down im   lbs and i ordered the xs which is roomy around the mid section but i think thats the style as the shoulders hit where they should it is such a fun and unique piece i cannot wait to wear it with tights or black leggings with boots
i tried on these pants and was instantly in love they are very flattering and stylish but also incredibly comfortable i am   and the length is perfect to wear with  heels i highly recommend these
got this in the black when i was in greenville nc i had seen it online for a little while and didnt think much of it until i tried it on in the store its surprisingly comfortable and it isnt too heavy its the perfect staple black shirt in my closet it is also very forgiving
love this blouse i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs which fits perfectly not form fitting but flattering washes beautifully too i highly recommend this blouse
love love this top it is soft comfortable and cute it is versatile eg i can dress up for work or dress down by throwing on a pair of jeans the tie at the neck adds a cute detail if you want it tied great staple for the wardrobe i purchased in the black and it is very versatile not sure how i feel about the print
just piping in here  ordered my usual size of small petite the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this but mind the size of the slip in the petites range and also it is aqua

i really love the idea behind this however the fit doesnt work for me im usually a s or xs in retailer tops and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops this one runs small though  the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width the neckline was very high higher than it looks in the model photo and the armholes were too big so i dont think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue the other criticism is that the front is not lined

i love this dress you can wear it for everyday or you can put some bling with it and dress it up it fits very well flattering i highly recommend
this is a cute stylish sweater different from the typical it doesnt itch which is key at least for me i ordered an extra small but i am normally a small since it seems to run long i think the neckline is unique 
stumbled upon this dress which had been returned to a store and was encouraged to try it on by the sales staff and am glad i did its a beautiful dress that i didnt need and have no idea what i will wear it for but bought anyway i got a size  and it fits perfectly though i will need to shorten it a bit i am busty and prefer a bit more coverage so will add more tulle to the v neck i agree with the other reviewer about the tulle underlay but it looks easy enough to remove from the lining o

i love love this dress except for the armpits if they had just made the armpits a normal round shape with normal openings the dress would have been perfection so audrey hepburn but i had to say no i really wish they would redo this dress with normal arm openings i think it would sell like crazy
after seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out i was curious about it but thought i was out of luck it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size i tried it and wasnt sold however i loved the color it was snug across the shoulders and arms the rest was somewhat flowy but boxy at the same time i ended up bringing it home to think on it after trying it on again i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t
this dress is beautiful just like the picture it fits true to size and is quite comfortable considering it is on the delicate side definitely recommend this one
i love this sweater tunic the neckline adds interest and is so flattering i think it is more flattering in person than in the photos of the model my husband even noticed the neckline and said he loves this top on me  it is soft and not itchy at all i bought my regular size small and will wear it with jeans or leggings and boots i love that this neckline comes up a bit but is not huge so i can definitely pair a scarf with it for a change if i wanted to this will definitely be a staple in
this dress was super cute online i ordered it in small and medium both fit one tighterobviously but could have gotten away with either the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i didnt think it was flattering on me it would be flattering on very slim body smaller on top i sent it back im a  c athletic build
i love this dress for fall it is slightly sheer so i would recommend wearing tights or a slip underneath but it is lightweight enough for fall that i can transition the dress into the season as it gets colder one note  i am  and was required to size down to an xs in this dress due to length the xs is perfect for work as it hits me slightly above my knees
this dress is beautiful  the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up i also like loose fitting clothing and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler

i adore the feel and cut of these culottes but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer picks piles and serious wear and tear after just one day i feel as if i wasted my money

"the dress is as great in person as it shows in the pictures if you usually buy petite keep in mind that you may like the regular size if you prefer the llonger look if you prefer a shorter length go for the petite size if this is what you usually get i am   lbs and tried both xs regular and xs petite i ultimately went with the regular size as i preferred the longer lengtheverything about this dress is perfect the color the material the cut highly recommended as a transition"
love these they are thick and comfortable they feel like sweat pants but are cute enough to wear out if you are running quick errands definitely recommend

this dress is amazing beautiful and perfect for fall the colors and beading are so much better in person the pockets are an added bonus im typically a xs but sized up to a s only because i felt the sleeves were tight and across the bust was tighter than id like when moving my arms the xs would have worked but the s is perfect comfort i highly recommend this beauty for reference im   lbs
these pants are lovely and comfortable but they are entirely too delicate i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them they snagged i was worried about it when i saw the fabric and thought id give it a try but i didnt think it would be this bad for the price i expect better quality also they run a little large unless i pull the waist down low it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher closer to the natural waist im usually a   in b
i think this is the perfect fall dress  i did not have the cleavage issue because i am going to wear the little button buttoned at the top  i like the sleeves can be pushed up or down depending upon your weather  i thought it be very slenderizing   i am thin on top but curvy on the bottom im going to wear it with closed toe wedges but if my legs were thinner i think tall boots would be pretty

this is absolutely beautiful  but i am only  the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone   so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots   likewise i did not detect even a speck of black to me it is navy and purple i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think youre going to have to do navy or denim
this dress is exactly what i was looking for i have a very business casual job but wearing jeans and blouses can get boring so im constantly on the lookout for easy goto dresses that i can throw on year round with flats booties sandals etc this dress is exactly what i had in mind and i look forward to wearing it in the fallspring with booties and in the winter with tights
these pants are really beautiful the material feels nice and i love the pull on style however they are much too long for me im  and they literally hang to my ankles which is not at all flattering like the photos i think if you are tall enough these are a wonderful piece
great knee length lovely twirl and drape though a staple piece the material and the blend of the navy and black bring this skirt up a notch pull on styling i purchased a small and returned it for an extra small as it was too large in the waist i like my skirts to sit at the natural waist and with the style of this skirt i think that would look most flattering and slimming my waist is abt  for reference  bust and hips abt  and typically a  at retailer the skirt is quite s
i skipped over these when they first cme in store but it was reccomended to me to try them on so i did and i loved them they look like a skirt which is amazing but you wont be worrying on those breezy days  they run very big im usually a  or  in pants and i got the xs and feel like i could have even sized down but thats the smallest size carried in store i got them in the green because i felt that the color went more with the casual feel of the pant if you are interested i

this feels and looks like a ballet skirt on so light and flowy super comfortable just love it extremely flattering cut tiny gathered folds at waistband add pretty detail and create a slimming effect on my tummy whats not to love great pockets too i have a  inseam and the length is perfect ordering in both colors now as i can see these becoming my go to bottoms all summer long
i bought this dress for an october wedding in savannah ga i love it can be dressed up or down im  and  lbs and bought an xs like other reviewers said its a little tight through the arms i probably could have done an xxs but wouldnt be as comfortable id recommend this dress to anyone looking for a versatile dress for fall and winter
"i am here online to buy this pant in both colors i tried it on today in store in regular lengh but am opting for petite size i am  i could have purchased the regular length which hit me above the ankle but i think p will be more flattering and better for summerthe pants are a woven material and kindof shiny the pants also may be a bit seethru in sunshine due to the structure of weave that said i am buying them anyways because they are that comfortable and professional i may"
love i was super hesitant to try this dress on it didnt look great online or on the hanger but it looked great on it has a very  feel i am curvy and it looked fabulous
i almost did not buy this dress because of the polyrayon construction but i saw some sweet styling on instagram that got me hooked the dress is silky soft and a bit oversized as i purchased the smallest of my size range looks very swingy and free spirited when worn loose cinch the string tie or add a wide belt for a defined waist and beautiful full skirt i have many outfits in mind for this perfect fall dress im excited to start wearing it my weight has been fluctuating so right now im

just be prepared this is huge i looked hilarious in my normal  this was in store luckily the the excellent personal stylist warned me i also dont think the colors are as good in person  bit dull if it fits you it could be nice
this is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while it covers all the important parts without being too baggy i found the fabric to be light and comfortable but heavy enough that a light colored bra cant be seen underneath with it great if you dont feel like wearing multiple layers
i like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it however i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating also would not recommend if you are busty because of how the stripes run it looks stretched out over my chest
love this sweater it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease very soft and seems durable i highly recommend it
this is a nice light top for the summer i love how your shoulders peak out from tee which gives it a touch of of sexiness it does run large so i went down a size i havent washed it yet so dont know if it will shrink i do recommend it though
i love the off the shoulder tee so much that i ordered two of them in different colors i can wear them with jeans or i can wear them with gym attire while out running errands and still feel like i look nice
when i saw this slipnighty online i loved it most of the nightgowns i own are from retailer and i am very pleased with them i ordered my normal size small and it fit well for reference i am   and   the only slight issue is that the fabric is quite sheer not a big deal since one is wearing this item to sleep in but it would have been better in my opinion if it wasnt so seethrough also this may not matter to anyone but the stitching along the top is a bright neon pin
i was quite excited to find this tee in the store the design looked interesting and it seemed nice on the mannequin the bright red color really stood out in person i am   tried on my usual size s and it was humongous although the sales lady found a size xs they dont have size xxs available in the store for me to try on it was still huge like a tent it probably would fit better for a tall body figure i would recommend those who are interested in this tee to try it in the store
i tried this top on instore in red and lavender i love it yes it is big but it is still really cute if you are between sizes go down a size i am   and went with an xs in the red it appears to fit in the front but looks larger in the back which i think the other reviewer was getting at
this picture does not due this sweater justice at all i purchased this today for summer its beyond cute and the colors are awesome its a very light sweater with a fitted but not too tight light feel the sleeves are a little longer than quarter length at least on me it looks amazing with white pants very fresh
on me this top is totally frumpy and boxy i am   and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt not fitted at all i ordered a largenot being sure of fit i have a flat stomach and it just hungyuck honestly for the price and fit i wouldnt consider a medium i think it would a tad better but not worth the price
reference    ordered size xs  the suit is pretty  under the neckline where the two orange panels meet the white center panel that corner puckers a bit  this will not happen if you have a larger chest than my  or have a longerbroader torso so that the fabric can stretch out thus pulling that merging area flat  the sides cut out lays flat when you stand up straight and gapes when your turnbend to the side  i think this is expected  the bottom section on the back c
"a perfect basic teeloved how soft it is not worth full price but definitely one to add to your cart once on sale"
"i just received this swimsuit today and love it  i was a little hesitant to order with the cutouts but i feel it is very flatteringi was choosing between an xs and s  i ended up going with xs and am glad i did i think going up would of caused gaping on the sidesgreat suit only comment is in the description i believe it said the straps are adjustable but they are not  also there is light padding which i appreciate"

i was worried this sweater would be too tight but it has a very flattering fit i am a librarian and this sweater makes me feel like a quirky librarian i love it
i found these jeans on the sale rack at my local retailer they were the very last pair and in my size i couldnt believe my luck  i tried them on and was very impressed with the fit and feel of the jeans thyre soft yet substantial they retain thier shape  love the worn in look to them    so adorable  nice slouchy skinny jean i stayed true to size
i ordered both colors but ended up keeping the green in petite xs bc the red in xs was just slightly too big both colors are gorgeous and i agree they have a retro  vibe just a tad itchy but not enough that it would make an undershirt absolutely necessary ill probably just wear it alone i think the regular size would work for most petites bc its not ridiculously long i would suggest sizing down in regular if youre petite though for instance the regular xs fit noticeably larger

as the previous reviewer mentioned the pockets ruin this dress pockets usually such a good idea but here theyre misplaced right on the hips and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss
this is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time i ordered it with the layered luna dress in grey and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo very chic i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come for reference i ordered my normal size xs   lbs muscular and did not find it to be too tight in the arms and i have fairly broad shoulders i did not try it on with long sleeves but i still think there would be adequate room
"i was so excited to see this shirt in petite sizing for reference i am     lbs   chest with a thin but athletic build  i love the feel of this shirt it is made from a tencil blend that gives it a nice weight and drape because i dont have much of a chest i do think it is a bit lowcut on me i will probably wear a cami underneath next time it is a pretty versatile dress up or down kind of piece which is why i chose it i gave it a four star rating only because it is ama s"

this is an amazing jacket it fits perfectly through the shoulders with enough give to make it comfortable i love the color and the feel of it as well it will be perfect for the spring and summer evenings
i ordered this jacket thinking it would look good with so many of my current outfits im usually between a small and medium in jackets so taking the advise of the other reviewers i went with a medium while it fit in the arms just fine the torso was tight i couldnt even zip it up i guess i should have gone with a large after mulling it over i decided to just return instead of exchanging i felt the jacket had a much harder edge to it than my style is i was very impressed with the qu
"i ordered the xl in white for fit its true to size it matches the models photos its a comfortable top the shape is good with the pleating but the color is definitely off its as if the white fabric was prewashed with navy its not the fresh crisp white shown at least for the one i received the quality of the material is basic the black version might be the better one overall im going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try overall i dont think its worth ful"
i agree with the othersthis is the type sweater that hooked me on retailer ten years ago i love my new sweater i do recommend wearing a long sleeve tee underneath the sleeves are itchy
this tank is well made and the top part is doubled partially so you can get away without wearing a bra if you wish im  and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured the pintucked area fit well not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i dont mind i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me i opted for the white vs the black because i love the pi
i love this sweater aside from it being absolutely adorable the quality is great and the sizing is accurate i have received so many compliments on it so far and honestly i want to wear it everyday the sweater is super soft and comfy and of course i totally recommend it thanks retailer
this brand makes the best jackets i got a vest from them last year and an olive moto jacket both fit amazing this one is no different it fits great love that its a great casual jacket with structure and drape i cant say enough good things about this jacket every time i wear it i feel so pulled together fun light gray color that you dont see too often in jackets this is a jacket i see in my wardrobe for years to come must have
i might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small for me its not true at all i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable but it was simply too short rather than  as it states on the website its more like  which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person i dont even want to go regular size because it wouldve been too big i saw some photos that others po
"i bought this top in the black with the dobby  shorts in grey and wore them as a set  of the  days last weekendmind you i am tall but the neckline is lovely the smocking creates a nice close drape and the length and the fullness in the bottom perfectly offset the shortshort concept got lots of compliments with the  i generally wear a  and ordered a medium which was fit nicely with enough room for a wash and dry going forward"
i ordered this in black in a medium ive ordered several deletta tops before and the mediums fit great but in this top i think i could have done a small i dont want to hassle with returning it tho and it should work fine
i saw this in store but they didnt have my size and i balked at the price however i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think its well worth it the quality is very nice and it fits tts i like that the arm materials is stretchy ive worn this with jeans but will also wear it with a skirt to the office its got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things
fabric quality is good pattern is pretty in person very comfortable im not sure if its because i have an ample chest but unfortunately it looked like a maternity shirt on me it looks good from the front but from other angles it looked bulky i tried in both white and black and i think the white looks betterthe smocked top is more visible
i bought this tank on a whim without trying it on in the store in black the detail on the front is cute and the peplum is really cute without being frumpy at all i am usually a small ocassionally a medium in retailer shirts and i bought this in small it fits but i feel like i could have gone up to a medium its just a little tight across the chest but i do have more broad shoulders than most so maybe its just because of that the fabric is nice and stretchy so i might be able to get away
i love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic however the pockets ruin it if thats possible they make the dress bulky around the hips i usually wear an  or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium i think this brand runs a little small the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents yearround wear i love the subtle texture one odd thing the tag is attached to the standup collar i had my hair up when i tried
cute and super comfortableso its the best of both worlds it fits true to size but i bought a size up to add a little extra length love the soft blue color and ruffles
loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer
so this dress is absolutely gorgeous my problem is i am  and it is very short wasted between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain doesnt work i think if you are taller this dress just wont work i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem
i just bought this pretty dress at my local retailer after finally deciding to go in the store to try it on once i saw it on display in the window in the lilac i already knew i was going to try that one on and take it home though i really love both colors and prints the dress fit me tts sz   and looks absolutely adorable on its super soft light weight but not so much that you dont feel its worth the price and the design reminds me of the retailer i love it has a wonderful vinta
i love this dress it is the kind of dress that i dream about the feel is young and carefree typically i love swing dresses on the tall thin models pictured but when i try them on i simply look frumpy this dress is an exception i have the lilac version and the fabric color and pattern enhance the boho pixie fairy aesthetic for reference i am   lbsaverage build a little busty  only the  was in stock so that is the size i ordered even though i wanted to try the  the  has en
this is made of soft sweatshirt material it is one of those dresses that you can put on with sandals or birkinstocks and go out to breakfast or throw it on to go to the beach or wear after yoga this is not a dressy dress that said i love it i used to have a sweatshirt dress from another brand that i wore out and have been searching for the replacement this color is a pale celadon a tad bit more vibrant than the photo which makes it more flattering than you may think i wear a  and
i was bummed about this dress i saw it online and loved both colors i tried it on in the store and it did not work for me i am  tall with an hourglass figure and it was too shot and too loose it looked like a babydoll nightgown i wanted to love it but i think this one only works on smaller frames onto the next
sometimes i feel like i have to try on the dresses that sell out super fast just out of curiosity and sometimes theyre surprise hits like this one i tried on the purpleblackblue option and i had to have it it is boxy through the torso but the length keeps it from being too cutesyits pretty short im just  and im not sure this is work appropriate without tights i may have to try though as otherwise its a great workable dress for summernot too tight or revealing in the b
"i saw this online and thought it was so prettyso i ordered a large even though im usually a medium in retailer shirts i thought i might need the extra room to layer i was in the store returning something and they had a medium and a large so i tried both and the large was way too big in my shoulders and chest even with a sweater the medium was a little tight in my hipsbut stillfit overall the medium was more flattering on me so i recommend ordering your regular size it is such a pretty v"
ive wanted a vest for the past few years and could never find the perfect one until now the material is perfect and the colors are amazing its definitely a vest that you can wear all year i would  recommend this
" i agree with the other reviewer the photos do not do this shirt justice its very cute and fits well the photos on the models are terrible im  tall  lbs and     and the size medium fit me perfectly im often in between a m and l for cloth and stone but the medium fit well which means it runs a little big i wanted a plain white shirt with a little interest and the side buttons add that it also means this is not a tuck in shirt but more of a tunic"
i purchased this dress in the red color overall quality is excellent the zipper was a little hard to work because the lace kept getting caught in it the neckline was also too high  im  and  the dress fit perfectly  there is was too much nude fabric showing through the dress i feel that this dress isnt versatile to me this is somethings that would be great for weddings or bridalbaby showers due to the lack of versatility and the fact that i wasnt in love with it i returned
i grabbed this on a lark because it look like a fun little throw on dress its a very lightweight sweatshirt material and fun and a fun flouncy design run a bit large and regular sizing was still above my knees if i were  years younger i may have bought it just for lounging but the over sized ruffly sleeves made me feel just a bit too silly and the color is pretty washed out not for me but cute for teens and early 
i was so excited to receive this dress it even has embroidered loops on the hem of the slip underneath which was such a cute detail its very pretty on that being said i ordered a size  which fit me perfectly  lbs but ladies i do not mean this in any way but in my personal opinion my arms are out of shape not toned and flabby the sleeves on this dress will not do you any justice it will make your arms look worse because of the shape of the sleeve so keep that in consideration if
this dress makes you feel like a little kid it certainly helps that it is an excellent twirling dress for sure i wish it had a little more definition to the waistit just barely works for larger chested women definitely on the line from being a little too baby doll shapeless the colors are so beautiful and the fabric so light that its hard to pass this one up its just too beautiful i recommend it but its probably not for everyone

this material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless it was not flattering at all on my shape i dont think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest
i saw this dress in the store in the coral color and tried it on i am   and slender to athletic build i wear the size  in this dress as far as sizes go for retailer i would say it is tts the slip fits like it should and the dress is flowing it is not see through as were some of the other silk dresses this summer it feels so comfortable and makes me feel pretty it is a flowing dress and meant to fit that way i waited for it to go on sale and the day it did i purchased it
unfortunately this top is shirtlength and im only  needs to be about  longer made of sweatshirt material which i wouldnt mind if it were longer also runs very wide ordered an xs and could have gone smaller
i fell in love with the dress when i saw it but i was worried about a few things before ordering it one comment mentioned that the slip underneath was tight in the hips yet as a size  in pants the slip was still fine the other concern was the length i was worried that the dress would be very short compared to my height however it was a good length in the front and the back was came down longer than the front which helped the overall length overall i ordered a size  and it fit well in
i loved the look and feel of this shirt the moment i saw it it would be so versatile with jeans skirts and black slacks i was contemplating wearing it with a tulle skirt for nye but it wasnt meant to be usually my issue with these tops is in the bust and strangely that wasnt the case this time this is great news also they made the sides adjustable so wide hips are not a problem either however i have muscular arms and well cloth and stone are not thinking about that they make the uppe
really stretchy and therefore not a whole lot of compression love the floral pattern and the color but theyre also surprisingly thin theyll be good for yoga in the summer months but i find them to be too thin to wear outside of the gym and i like a legging i can feel comfortable in running errands to and from the gym too fit true to size
first this picture does not do this shirt justice in fact the hanger does not do this shirt justice you must try this shirt on it drapes so well not as soft as some cloth  stone tops but it is still very soft the slightly stiffer feel makes it easier to dress up theres no pockets which is nice in a button down it drapes in a very flattering way ive never been happier with a clothstone garment i normally wear a small in this brand and that is true for this top as well however
"such a cute dress it was just way too big in the back of the dress too much fabric it just hung withno form around waist it appeared more fitted on the model than the one i received dress was quitea bit longer in the back so i felt like the front was riding up just in the minutes of trying it on sadly i have to return it it did come with an underneath slip which was necessary as the fabric was verythinrecommend with caution to sizing"
i wasnt sure about this dress because some of retailers cloths can make a women appear older before her time i have to say that is not the case with this dress i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size  this dress could not have been more beautiful on im   and it fit perfect the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin i wont even need sunless tanner i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again
this dress is horrible i cant believe they can get away with calling it a dress it should have been called a tunic or shirt it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures no way it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff it came to the top of my thighs i cant find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth
i so wanted to love this tank and was so excited to get it in the mail i got a size small my usual and it ran so large i wasnt even sure an xs wouldve fit properly the material looked lighter and blousey on the model but in person is much thicker and sort of hangs underarms run large and are gaping from the body i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it but it just cant work on me
i love this top lovely light airy material though i dont think ill wear a cami under it im usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small i love the way it fits
this is even nicer in person than it is online i absolutely love it i am   and  lbs and ordered my usual size small i probably could have worn an extra small but dont feel like the small is too big this could be my favorite purchase of the season
i bought this top in a size   im  with a longer torso i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up the material is on the thicker side so its a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic

"this casual top is adorable a great top for jeans linen pants or shorts it would be cute with skirts too i love the heavy feel of the fabric too many fabrics today are thin andor clingy this is soft but is substantial it works well on my bodytype tall thin without much figure its not cheap but something ill likely keep for a few years"
i actually rather like this top i ordered a size smaller than usual based on how flowy it looks in the picture and was quite pleased the pink color is rich and i love the cut work it has a bit of a sparkle in it and is very pretty and flattering on the back it does swing out a lot but i ended up half tucking it the pink color is very nice it is gauze material so of course it is thin i usually buy  but this  was great also there was no petite in the pink so cant comment on
i love this shirt i bought it in both black and white and i get compliments every time i wear it i totally recommend this top its a great material and easy to wear with a lot of different bottoms
id recommend getting this top but only after understanding its limitations its beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you accentuating your stomach and ma

i really feel in love with the details of these joggers and they did not fail me when they arrived i havent worn them yet but tried them on and they seem like nice little relaxed wear with a tee shirt i can see them being worn with a cami in warm weather or a relaxed tee shirt in a variety of colors all in all  very versatile  and i recommend them

from the photos i thought the design was embroidered in reality it is stamped on there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins but overall the design is just printed on the fabric i didnt feel it looked good in fact it looked kind of cheap to me so i returned it the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual i was disappointed it didnt work out
i am petite   purchased the xsmall and it is a little big but had to have this i would say runs a bit large i think it will be a great addition to any wardrobe
these pants have substance in the material it seems thick i found htem to be very comfortable and love the tir waist detail my only complaint is they dont come in petites so on my short legs teh hem came jsut above my ankle i think htey would look nicer with a tighter shirt than pictured on the model did not purchasebut keeping in mind for future

i love paige jeans and these are no exception the wash is so so great  a faded blackcharcoal grey its like having two pairs of jeans in one i am normally a  in most jeans and thats what i took in these highly recommend
im a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small so i ordered this in a small and the top was a little loose but it was way too short theres no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public im  and the hem was higher than midthigh on me the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape
as soon as i saw this dress i knew i wanted it it looked perfect for travel and just comfy as can be now i usually wear a large so i ordered one and patiently waited for its arrival however when i tried it on it was too big and the button on the sleeve popped off i would recommend giving the buttons a little extra support if you can i purchased a medium and it fits perfectly this dress is one that will work year round for a variety of events and occasions
i love the fit feel and quality but i didnt realize these are the new improved fabric denim weave that has almost no stretch  i usually wear a  and i wish i had purchased the  or  to accommodate my weight fluctuations  the great thing about this style is that i will not stretch out at the stress points unattractively
"the fabric pattern is darling i wore it in amsterdam and was told it looks like a traditional folk pattern the dress is lightweight and is loose at the waist sometimes i add a belt to cinch it inlike another reviewer said the buttons do pop off easily i lost one at the cuff on the first day i wore the dress"
i loved the look of this sweater online but it just didnt work for me the fit wasnt good enough the style okay the color fine the feel scratchy overall it did not work for my body
this sweater is super cute with the mock neck i love all  colors i typically wear either an xs or s in retailer sweaters and purchased a s in this one now that ive put it on again at home im wondering if i should have sized up to a m mainly due to the sleeves and hem of the sweater being short im  and  lbs so not overly tall and dont typically have this issue i feel like the model who is likely taller than me has to have on at least a size l and have the sweater pinned back
i absolutely adore this shirt it is such a comfortable material and goes great with a pair of jeans i love how it fits tightly in the sleeves and flows out at the bottom just the right amount i highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe
agree with above review these are described totally wrong they are not  rise they are very high rise so much that i didnt even try them onthe color isnt good either it looks like a cheap levis color or just not a quality denim if you like high rise you might like them i cant comment on fit
think price convinced me to put this in my bag  the oops of on line shopping i guess the strip and stitch like snowflake is just not me a little too cutesy for me if strip alone might have kept  but this is just too much not my style  back it goes
i liked this as soon as i saw it the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top the fir is good not too right or lose i took a size medium which was good for my   lb frame the  cotton was a plus for me also the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing i dont feel like i see myself all over town
its soft and not itchy at all itchy sweater is my all time nightmare the design makes you feel like a snow princess i am    bra and take this in size small
i love the color mustard and design of this shirt however the description says its made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that its actually made of  modal  which is a big difference to me i also think it runs small  i ordered a medium    but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model finally the modal fabric is quite thin and i dont imagine itll last too long without tearing ill probably keep it because i l
i should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo its very scratchy and uncomfortable i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider which would have been more flattering on me i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this im sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they dont mind the texture im sending it back
i found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price its perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down its a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit definitely worth the sale price
i loved this dress i am  ft tall and usually wear xs this dress i would definitely need an xxs in i like things not too tight but this was too roomy so the style was lost it was a little long but i think that is because it kind of hung on me the material is light but substantial it has a lot of stretch to it which is very nice it has a silky feel  could be worn dressy or every day a very good dress all around waiting for the xxs to come in  i would definitely recommend it

i love the color combination and the bodice is very falttering it has a tiny bit of stretch the tulle is also feminine i love that i could wear this with a moto jacket sizing no need for petite it was short enough in regualr size i think petite would have been too short unless you are younger
i thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks but its completely see through  i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok but its hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to  if the fabric was a little thicker this would be the perfect tank  unless your planning on layering this i wouldnt recommend
"this is a cute dress but just not a keeper for me the top portion of the dress is fairly snug i am normally a small in retailer sizes but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust otherwise it was cute and simple and the tulle was quite softi think that i would have gone with a medium but i am wearing a small in the photo for reference i am   lbs  and  waist"
"this dress fit perfectly i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well i do however think that the dress is over priced for as often as you would wear this dress given that isnt a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once i think the price is way too high a must have on sale or clearance but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination we will see t"

got this  days ago and have worn it  of those days it is a perfect beautiful autumn dress the fabric is textured and slightly colorvaried in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth the fabric is a thin sweater knit  because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does nor would it be as figureflattering despite its thinness it is still warm would buy this in oth
the issues the other reviewers mentioned didnt bother me as i dont have the prior years version to compare i love the color and feel of the fabric  a little heavier and great for early fall layering the armholes werent big for me but i got a small and would normally be a medium the cut works great for a very curvy petite frame it doesnt add bulk but does flatter a larger chest i can see why this doesnt work for taller ladies as the pockets and hip do flare with the heavier fabric but

i really fell in love with this shirt i am about   and  pounds i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide i was ready to fly although the model wears this shirt really nicely i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body not quite sure what that is also this shirt is shorter than what i expected it looks a lot longer on the model i had to return this shirt
i bought these in my usual size  and they were much too loose so i returned them i definitely need a   inch hips  low waist  waist i have lost a few pounds but i am usually a size  in pants even loose i can see the pants are flattering and long enough for my leggy   frame they are still cropped but i would say look much the same as on the model if you are shorter i think the petite option would be necessary to achieve a cropped look the material is not bright white wi
"love this top dramatic in a casual wayi ordered the teal and love love love itwith skinny jeans or leggings the style is perfect i am over  so the teal is gorgeous and i think very age appropriatei ordered the blue also a very pretty shade of bluebut felt in this style the brightlight colors would be more appropriate for someone youngerits a stunning topand fits very true to sizethe drama of the ruffle is what sets it aparthoping they do"
great denim color and fit gives a nice feel to the waist
"these pants are simply darling i purchased them with my birthday discount thank you retailer and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny flattering and the most important feature of any pant makes my butt look good dont hesitate buy these today before they are out of stock the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality"
i think i wanted a skirt like this in the  with its aged denim and retro style it looks like ive had it all that time i couldnt zip my usual  but the  is comfortable if a bit snug sitting right at my natural waist its flattering and shows off my waist with tops tucked in something i never do with my other skirts which all sit lower i like how it flares a little oddly due to the horizontal seam its interesting and different i will wear it in summer with sandals and it will lo
i didnt think much of this online but it was very nice in person i was nervous it would look bulky but it was very flattering and slimming fits tts
i love the fabric of this shirt  its super soft however the fit is off  im normally a medium and the buttons across the chest were gaping open when buttoned never a problem for me im a  and not very busty it is also a bit on the short side especially when the general trend is toward longer shirtstunics i would recommend sizing up in fact im going to try this in a large fingers crossed
i saw this blouse and had to have it i ordered my usual size large and was shocked at how big it was it looked like a maternity top on me so i sized down to medium it fit much better and i was able to fully appreciate how gorgeous the colors were and how feminine and pretty the mock neck was i definitely recommend it but suggest to size down for a better fit

this top looks even better in person the fit is very flattering and the fabric is comfortable i highly recommend it
i adore this top  so cute flattering and easy to dress up or down yes it is a little better suited for larger chests but i personally dont mind a discreet pin for this beauty im a  and slim build and the only issue is when i bend forward  it falls beautifully otherwise great with everything from a black pencil skirt to jeans and a black leather jacketcute with denim jacket and white pants too easy wardrobe piece
i got the small petite and this fits beautifully as on the model i am  i do think that it flatters a flat belly more than it would flatter a fatter one it would certainly hide any belly but the drape works best if youre streamlined i imagine if youve got a tapering torso go for it depending on your bust you may want to pin the overlapped fabric just to be sure of hiding the bottom of your bra not that ive found it a problem
i love the feel of this shirt from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fabmore vivid than the photo the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck if you want a more refined flannel lookfeel this is it i find it tts if youre in between sizes i would order down
i really wanted to love these because i love my other steps but they did not feel or fit the same way at all i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me sadly these will be going back

what originally attracted me to this top was the rich floral print with the stunning and vibrant colors however the colors in this blouse are more vintage autumn than actually pictured on this model although the colors are darker you can still wear many things with this blouse the top is floaty but doesnt look like a tent i feel ultra feminine and comfortable in it definitely a top that you need for that something special but it is not too dressy or not too casualjust perfect don
i love the fit and feel of this shirt the fit is narrow but true to size the stitching details are beautiful and make this shirt really versatile
ugh the fit of this dress is terrible  what a beautiful dress though  the material and the colors  had so much potential but the fit is awful  i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok if not a tad big but hip down was crazy tight that i couldnt even zip it without a ton of effort i dont think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger disappointing
"i love the design of this blouse and the pattern but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo the quality is pretty poor i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase sending it back  it comes with a tank top just to let others know"
this shirt is absolutely beautiful the front is very thin and delicate but wearing a nude bra underneath you cant see a thing i did need to add a snap between the top two buttons to avoid the chest gap but the back of the shirt offers enough stretch that it doesnt appear to pull at all its hard to find a button down that fits nicely when your short waisted and large chested this one is it
"i am glad to add this very versitile top to my wardrobe it can be worn with a sweater in the cooler months like i wore it today a business jacket or alone in the summer i wore it with a fitandflare skirt today but it goes with pants jeans shorts etcfyi i am a   short waist broad shouldersback size m in knit tops  in fitted or ones with buttons i purchased my normal size m in this topi have no real waist so the shape of the top really does help to make one for"
online i like the design the leaves stand out inperson the leaves dont stand out as much you can barely see them they are so light the top is slightly seethrough the price is high i think this top would work better on a more slender frame i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric it may look better on a slender frame i think it was just too light and thin for me

thrilled this statement piece is back i get so many compliments on this and its practical as well for our cold minnesota winters highly recommend
i wanted to love this top but couldnt i am curvy   and this accentuated my hips which is not needed and made my chestwhole shape seem boxy i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build the bottom would help give some shape pleating on front would help chest seem larger i did love the color and construction lace details  sleeves
this sweater coat is perfect ive been looking for one i loved for years in my opinion it runs true to size i ordered my usual xsp it is fitted in the arms and loose on the body i love it
heres the thing i ride horses you would think this would mean i would love this but the first time it came around i hesitated simply because i spent too much of my childhood in horsebedecked things looked overwhelmingly nerdy but this time having actually purchased the belted navy birds version i had to give it a try and its kind of a must there is just something about the way it falls that is super flattering its just warm enough to serve as a jacket right now in new england but
this is every bit as lovely as shown the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks lace embellishments and covered buttons for me tts i bought the size   my normal size i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts i think its a wonderful rendition of a denim top this would work in any season of the year
i bought this coat  years ago and every fallwinter i cant wait to wear it again cant even begin to describe how many people comment on how beautiful and unique it is it has worn well over the years considering how much it has been worn but i just might be tempted to buy it again which is something i have never done with a statement piece the only design feature i would change is that it has no closure i actually had a beautiful large antique button that i sewed on with a snap and it
great sweater coat  fits a bit large  purchased a smallwhich is unusual for me  i normally wear a medium or sometimes a large  retailer clothes are mosly cut small  it looks great onwarm comfy and attractive  i am very pleased with this purchase  highly recommend
love this top the colors are so fun and happy and the fabricfit are soft and breezy it is definitely on the boxy side but not in an unflattering way in my opinion super cute in my usual size small
i read the existing reviews before purchasing and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer i figured by ordering a medium i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater this was not the case the sweater is short does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind and i assume the model is taller than ias models are usually tall for reference i am  medium build
great tee the color online is lighter and nicer in my opinion than in reality its much darker in real life but otherwise its a super soft tee with gently fluttered sleeves and side slits i bought it in a s and its roomy without being oversized great for fall
the shirt looks so much more flattering on the body than on the hanger it has a luxuriously soft  feel without compromising fabric quality i purchased both the white and navy color indeed a closet staple
i loved the way this top looked in stock photos the colors are bright and cheery and its a great transition piece but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings if that makes sense they are stiff and wide and awkward ive worn this a few times hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down they havent maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something
yes this is a thinner bra its almost sheer when you hold it up to the light but it fit perfectly  and is seamless under even the thinnest tops i love that its not padded i feel like it just slightly enhances my natural shape without adding anything more and i really wish i had bought multiples before they sold out i cant speak to how it will hold up since i just got it yesterday and im wearing it for the first time today but im keeping my fingers crossed that it will last as wel
this tee is cute keep in mind the white is totally sheer but its huge i ordered an xxs and its very loose and drapey which is likely the style but when did sizing get to unrealistic also a totally sheer basically a sort of fancier cotton tee for  no way
tla makes the best tees soft feel sophisticated color layering and a body skimming shape  all retained after multiple washings versatile too other tees fade stretch out shrink not tla a gem
i thought this was adorable on the model but not so much on me i actually didnt mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan but i didnt want to keep it for  look the material felt inexpensive the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself im  and about  lbs
i was so excited to get this in the mail and so disappointed when i put it on it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up but i dont really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror  lumpiness along the seams i dont know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not but it gave me lumpylooking hips and then kind of clung around my midthigh area returned it the next day
i think these look great i found them on the sale rack and at  w  off its a pretty great deal i plan on wearing with low heels hope they work out i will show to boyfriend get his feedback too

such a cute plaid print i couldnt resist ordering this but all of the petite sizes were sold out i went with the xs based on other reviews and it was just too huge i ended up returning it i think the xs petite may have worked but its sold out so ill never know it is boxy so you may need to be careful if that fit works for your body or not the colors are magnificent
spotted this in the local store last week  just had to try it on it is a soft cotton gauze texture which is slightly stiff but in a good way my usual size small was too big the oversized look was fine from front  back view but in the side view the bottom stuck way out the xs was much better so i took it home its very comfy  looks great with dark blue denim

i love this dress it is comfortable and pretty well made and classic it edges toward the larger size however it is supposed to be big i got a small and at first it looked too big but the shoulders are perfect i feel like sissy spacek in this gown and you will also
bought this and tried it on in the store when i first tried it on i thought it was off the shoulder but the elastic is so tight it hurt within a minute of having it on i got my usual size xs and it fits fine if i wear this as a regular top and not off the shoulder it has a thin elastic not the thicker band maybe some could pull this off for off the shoulder but in my opinion its not comfortable that way i bought the other white off the shoulder top from retailer last month and its fine
im very pleased with this jacket ive never owned a vegan leather anything so i didnt know if it would show up cheap looking or smelly but to my surprise it didnt have a smell or that shiny cheap look im so glad i headed the other reviewers advise and i sized up my typical size would have been to tight and short im excited to wear this with dresses and jeans this fall i bought the honey color and its more like a cross between beige and blusha slight dusty pink hue i love
i ordered a small which is my usual retailer size but this was like a tent on me its fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasnt what i was looking for also it is very long a very weird amount of long also there is only eyelet on the front the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing
id been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations wellmade lovely color very soft flattering cut it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s its warm and the lining is very pretty hopefully itll hold up to daily wear id definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall  spring i got the plum color
i have a hard time with jackets fitting because i have chubby arms compared to the rest of me i like the way this fits and it doesnt pull when i try to cross my arms in front i feel like its good quality and hopefully wont flake the way vegan ie fake leather can and i think i can throw it over a top with jeans or a dress and it will be cute and versatile i also like the length that hits right at my hip im  and dont like when jackets like this are are too long

i have an hourglass shape and this dress is a good fit i think this dress looks better in person than it does in pictures however im concerned about washing it with that stark fabric and color change
i agree the pictures are confusing the front top of the dress is not cut out as some pictures seem to indicate this is such a great dress it has a great lining underneath and is really flattering and nicerdressier looking in person than i imagined it would be i think it fits true to size i either wear a  or a  in most retailer dresses and the  in this dress fits me well im planning to wear this dress to my bridesmaids luncheon i definitely recommend

"there is some confusion in the first few reviews over the image but the dress has a medium green lace and does not have a cut out at the front of the neck it runs more true to size than some dresses at antrho  my size is a small  petite meaning that i often end up in a  and the six is perfect the dress hangs gorgeously and fits fabulously the zipper is a bit hard to get through the seams and lace but worth itit has a formal feel but i think it can be made casual with shoes a"

this was a last minute addition to my online order to hit the free shipping anyway this ended up being my favorite item from my order i love the way it wraps and also lays open i didnt realize that the fabric was a mix of two different knits but i think it adds nice interest i ordered the redwhich is a nice deep rednot an obnoxious fire engine red its very complimentary to my skin tone and dark hair i run between a small and medium but chose the medium since it looked like it c
this is a beautiful skirt great soft draping fabric fringed along the edges i ordered size large which was an okay fit perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist because i carry my weight in the tummy this made me look wider than i am as an elder i just couldnt handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee i have great legs but my knees arent their best feature so sadly returned but i do recommend
i saw this jacket in a store and wanted it right then and there i bought a shirt and scarf instead but it was on my mind when i saw it on sale i grabbed it the fit is a little boxy but the length was perfect not too short the small amount of spandex is so comfortable it is versatile because the green arms can go with colored jeans well i am  i can wear a med or large i bought the large it fits perfectly to layer short or long sleeves not a typical denim jacket looks great over a
fits well super soft and very flattering great for layering and for dressing up or down highly recommend
this tank is an easy piece to add into your summer wardrobe and its amazingly affordable i dont think the material is too think like the previous reviewer i chose the petite size and it sits well at the chest and is a great length not too long but still able to front tuck i bought two colors and am interested in all the rest

im happy to say i got this on the sale rack but had been eyeing this long before  it is a flattering fit on me in size large  i just love the colors in the print  also the style is not a basic shell but a very feminine cut  the skinny straps are also a very nice touch  i plan on wearing this with my long white linen skirt denim capris or with shorts  i think i will also opt for a solid cardi or scarf  this is just so pretty
this is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk i received many compliments when i wore this with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry the fit is true to size i took my usual size l it is longer on me than the model and my only complaint is the slipit is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together so i had to find a different slip i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer i dont
i love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath
the fabric  feel and design of this dress is sooo cute but so large that sadly it will need to go back beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering
i tried this on blue in size  or xs not sure how sizing was regular size sometimes i need petite i dont think i need petite in this one though i love the peek of lighter solid fabric on the hem the whole tank is very soft probably need a strapless bra to wear it but could be paired with jeans for casual look or nice pants pencil skirt for dressier look i am  lbs and  dd for reference
"i love the style and look oft this blouse but the fit is a bit off for me im usually either a l or xl i dont think it came in an xl so i decided to give the l a shot i would say it runs roomy except through the arms i found the arms to run strangely tightand its not an area i usually have a problem with the body skimmed nicely over my trouble spots middle i found the neckline very flattering and it laid nicely over by dd bust the v is deep but you dont feel overexposed the b"

when i received this tank i ordered the blue i almost returned it because it seemed really thin almost see through however once i tried it on it had a good fit not see through just lightweight and breezy i especially like the twisted details on the straps i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort especially because it is on the thin side
beautiful top the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school its a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but its beautiful definitely worth getting
crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around the waist section where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and didnt lay well i am   lbs   waist and  hip usually wear a  or extra small in the maeve clothing that isnt a fitted style i bought the s which fit well except for the waist issue described above this is a fitted dress i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received it is a great style idea
when i first tried it on i was worried it would add  lbs to my hourglass frame but if worn correctly it actually has a flattering slimming effect i recommend wearing it open like in the photo with the same type of outfit underneathlooks very chic or to give yourself a defined waist use the provided ribbon belt tied to the side or use your own large statement belt also looks great with vintage sunglasses the fabric quality cant be beat its nice and heavy to the touch i ca

im a powerwalker i bought this tank in  colors and rotate through them theyre great for working out with a nice sports bra underneath i also wear them with leggings so cute love the colors the fit yes theyre thin i dont think theyll last for years and years but with the sale price they are such a great deal
i bought this top in two colorsi think its a really cute easy top to wear but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming which im sure will be a hole in no time two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears
i love this top so much so that i bought it in black and red i do think it runs a bit big i normally wear a medium or small i bought this in extra small and it fits beautifully can be dressed up or dressed down love that it is a double layered knit too the fabric is soft and drappy this is a staple top looks great with a pencil skirt tucked in got lots of compliments when i wore the red one havent worn the black one yet for reference im   weigh  and wear a 
i absolutely love the print its what caught my eye first when scrolling down the page the fabric is very soft single layer the model definitely makes this shirt look slimmer or tighter to the body than the shirt actually is the slimmer fit was the next thing i was looking forward to but like other reviews it is very flowy and the fabric falls away from the bottom below the bust which im not mad about when wearing this in the summerthe occasional breeze will feel nicer with a loose to
i love the look of this top im usually a size  or  and i tried on a size l and it seemed really big and looked a little like a maternity top i thought maybe it was too big and ordered a size m unfortunately it still looked maternityish i think the bottom of this is flared so much that if you have a big bust at all it will look like a maternity top on you
purchased in the red and love it love that it goes with anything from work pants to jean shorts the ruffle details add just a little extra which makes it perfect i just paired with gray chinos a couple days ago and it made a lovely outfit fits tts i wear an xs and purchased that
i was on the fence about this toposition because as others have stated it is quite billowy at the bottom just before returning i decided to try it on with a navy linen vneck cardi and it completely changed my mind wow now i am not saying that this isnt beautiful on its own becauseit truly is i am just saying that now this has become a truly versatile piece in my wardrobe i did not order a petite even though i am  and for that in am glad i ordered regular size xs  
"i bought three  in part because they were on sale i do not think that i will ever wear these without a sports bra though they are too low in the front and on the sides for a regular bra and too thin to go braless that said they may look cute with some of the lacyshowme bras that seem to be trendy right now i am typically a small and bought xsmall the drape is not that different in the two sizes but the length of the straps was much less revealing in the smaller size alli"
when i spotted this online i just knew it was a must have holding horses brand usually runs big on me but this is a more fitted top i ordered the size    so i cld compare well the  is a little snug in the bust area  the bodice seam falls high across the midbust area except for that the fit is good being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i dont think the  works for me the size  is much looser overall  the fit is much better in the bust area the armh
i wasnt sure about these when i first took them out but they are so cute the fabric is super soft and skims the bodyis not clingy i got the black  the red the red is more of a magenta but im okay with that i think these will be great in the fall and early winter too under cardigans  light jackets another bonus they do not show a ton of cleavage like a lot of tops out there the arm holes are also very close to perfect i hate how big the armholes are on tops that basically require
love this sweater great quality  styling slimming and the side slits add a feminine appeal pair with your legging and boots and enjoy the compliments
this shirt is really cute but a little stiff it does come with a slip but the slip was tight but the shirt fit maybe even a little big i used another cami under which was better i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs the actual shirt i got it in the store with the  off so it was a good deal it does stretch out as you wear it so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger but still cute on and for a summer shirt its thin so it does work well in that r

this cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so its a winwin it hangs a little boxy so ill need to figure out how to style it so its more flattering the pockets are a pretty gold color you can see it from the inside and adds a nice touch of color its a keeper

i initially saw this sweater in the store and it really stood out the rose pink color is absolutely beautiful and i love the glimmer band it adds a beautiful detail to the sweater the fabric is very soft the only downside i see is that lint did get all over the tank top i was wearing underneath though i think that will change over time as i wear it more it wasnt a huge inconvenience which is why i still give this  stars i am always a small at retailer which is what i ordered so
love my jeans fit great and very flattering they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit receive compliments every time i wear them if they go on sale i will buy another 
i probably would not have purchased this sweater had i only seen it online because i typically think wool is scratchy but this sweater caught my eye in the store and it is as soft as a sweater can get i love the pink with the gold trim it is so soft and warm i have washed and worn it a few times already and have not had any problems with stretching either
at  i typically order petite clothingi was unsure of this dresstunicshirt from the photos online the reviews and the hilow hem i ordered xs and pxs about  both fit as far as shoulders and through the body but the pxs was way too short on me to wear as a dress without any leggings the length of the regular xs works great and i feel is appropriate for someone my age it is buttery soft and so comfortable i ordered the suede wrap belt to go with it also the sleeves are too ti
this sweater is super soft and the metallic banding is a really nice detail the fabric could turn out to be a bit fragile though if you have a chest it may feel a bit boxier than you expect but i dont mind it for a comfy cozy soft sweater

love this dress very soft and easy to wear im  and it hits the top of my knees which is perfect for me cant wait to wear it with white leggings and boots this winter ive seen several similar styles and tried on a few at other boutiques but they were thick material and bulky denim this is the perfect light and soft to the touch highly recommend
the style was really cute but the fit was huge i ordered an xs i dont think going to the xxs would have helped i ended up returning it
i was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater the sweater looks like its falling apart and it is huge i would not recommend this even at a clearance price
im very happy with this sweaterits very soft to the touch and comfortable to wear i have the pink version and find the shimmer on the waist and arms to be a nice touch the only concern i have for this is that it feels like it stretches out a bit easily by the end of the day the arms feel a bit baggy
colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and thats where it ends cheap flimsy polyester and no lining far too expensive for what it is on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great i would say it runs a tad big but in my case  i have wide shoulders not big enough to downsize too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress
i saw the neutral motif in the theres only one left hanger in the store and tried it on its very pretty cute and sweet i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a babydoll look but thats just my preference i tried on size  and its a bit tight in the chest area im    waist  hips so i think size  would fit very well despite the pretty flower design in my personal opinion i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric

the fit is definitely more straightleg and not skinny as the photos seem to imply at  and  lbs the size  fit my waist and butt wonderfully and the length was great but the jean lost shape at the knee i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit
looked really cute on line arrived with a large hole in the front quality and look was very cheap would not recommend this sweater at all step it up please retailer
this top is so cute on would look great on anyone as the style quality and color is incredible highly recommend even at this price you wont regret it
ive been searching for the perfect gray cardigan and i knew i had to have this one unfortunately the first cardigan i received had two obvious pulled threads so i returned it i took a chance and ordered the cardigan again and im so glad i did it is so comfy and goes with everything my only concern is how it will hold up as it is already showing some fuzziness after two wears if this makes it to the sale price i would highly recommend
this is truly a beautiful top the beading and lace are subtle but add such a special feminine touch i love the breezy swingy shape very flattering this is one item i will be sure to treasure for years to come love
i wanted to love this dress i preordered it and waiting  weeks for it arrive when it arrived the dress was much more pleated than i thought im not sure if i misunderstood the images but i did not know the dress was going to being pleated all over i just thought that the fabric had a texture the print is adorable but the shape of the dress was not flattering on me i am pretty straight down with somewhat wide hips but the fabric of the dress made me look larger than i am i think this w
so first off yes these are almost mindnumbingly expensive however i think the design and quality are absolutely there the label lowrise always makes me wary as someone who is curvy low rise often  muffin top danger and bad early  flashbacks but the low rise design of these is actually great they are mainly low rise in the front angling down slightly toward the button and in the back they are not super high but more of a mid rise so you wont have to be really careful ben
a swing top by tiny done right this is a well made top that fits in all the right places no gapping arm pit the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size you may have to go down two sizes i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother
this is a treasure and must buy friends tiny designs the most amazing blouses and shirts and i feel stoked to have gotten this one the level of detailed embroidery on the front and tiny silver and gold sequins on silver net lace at the shoulders is artistic and welldesigned ive always found the tiny brand to be predictably one size small but when i get past my ego and order one size up to a large i am sooooo satisfied this sartorial work of art is completely lovely i have a busty f
sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump  i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was

i want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl  with sizing like this one size fits all could just about do it
never thought i would buy a jumpsuit but this one is gorgeous i put true to size i ordered a m and a l i kept the l because i like the looser fit weigh  and am    tall i carry any extra weight at my waist and the l just looked better i almost always wear a m in retailer clothes love the feel of it and the way it looks on me really looking forward to wearing it on sale it is a great buy
"i bought this outfit online on sale  so i only paid  but i think if i saw it in person first i probably wouldnt have purchased it while the design is cute the fabric is beyond cheap its not just polyester  its like a plastic polyester i think if you dress it up with high heels necklace armful of bangles you can probably distract from the fabric   purchased xs and its a little big still"

this is a great shirt fits perfect and super comfortable but you feel stylish and pretty
similar to the previous reviewer im also between sizes and for pencil skirts its usually the larger size that end up fitting whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch my smaller size  fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip the fabric is wonderful the skirt length is great for work and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit
i am currently studying at a university where i am constantly reviewed on how i dress if im underdressed i get comments and if im overdressed i get even more comments the other day i wore a plain navy blue blazer and people asked me all day what the occasion was for me this blazer is a nice solution to the standard uniform blazer the stripes and light grey color make this blazer more casual for me but i still feel put together for class the fit is also excellent and doesnt feel boxy at

really great shirt i made the mistake of ordering normal size xs and it was way too small this is more like ordering in dress shirt size so think    etc definitely going to have to send back and order up to s or m will be a keeper once i get the right fit
although this is not my husbands favorite he prefers things a little more tailored i absolutely adore this i got this in the ivorycream color not realizing they had it in two more colors i just ordered the blue i loved the way the size small fit not as wide but the medium for my height  fit better and was longer if i want to wear it as a dress i could i highly recommend this well made and looks great
"i ordered these pants in black and green the fit of the pants is perfection they feel amazing and are so flattering they do run a full size small im consistently a size  in all pants typically wear paige joes and frame and always a  but i had to get these in an  the  feel great though so i think theyre just a full size small secondly the green color is not at all whats pictured the green is hunter not olive and much less versatile ill be returning the green pants"

the design is so cute people in different yoga poses small and subtle prints and a must for a yogini i love the colors its colorful but not too bright and its beautiful against the white background i ordered xs im   waist  hips and it fit perfectly it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material i like the fact that theres no stretchy spandex feel just pure soft cotton feel its great for gals who are conscious about the arms

i think this tshirt is so cute simple but cute i originally ordered this in medium i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big my normal size is small so i reordered it it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath i plan to wear this to my  year olds gymnastics class it is little yoga people but close enough i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well
cute in theory i love the bright colors the tied black collar sash and the  vibe however the fabric is cheap and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern maybe this was intentional but with the shirt i received it looked horrible i sent it back i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam so it is a bit deceiving i wouldnt buy this top at any price based on
i am not a bright clothing person but adore this top if this is the right red for you i highly recommend it is a beautiful bright red no orange tones so really works with my skin tones it is a very comfy shirt and although it is a stretchy fabric it did not show any lumps or bumps in the upper back has a beautiful flow to it and looks not only great with jeans but really cute with a patterned sweater pencil skirt i bought at retailer a couple years ago and always with a good old black pencil
color is pretty true to pic a bright blue red  sleeves have more volume than pic  so does the body  in my opinion  maybe if i looked like the model  i wear a  in jeans and it doesnt look so cute on me  also im a brunette  angles  pinning  i have to wonder  probably just pics at good angles  it looks really cute on the model though
love the dress feel it fits true to size or slightly largerknocked off a star as my dress arrived without the slip liner i luckily have a slip that works from another dressthe beading is a lovely surprise subtle and just enough sparkle in the sun but not too much
this is a review of customer service in generalfrom several issues with online shopping i dont understand why you ask for my opinion and say it counts when clearly it does noti have had a lot of issues receiving parcels from one of your carrierslaser ship and i have reported the issues to them and retailerbut it appears only the good parts are readthis poor service cost me money in postage and lost discounts but again im ignoredand i had to order my last returned parcel again pay more fo
plan to wear this with pants may not fit some body types due to the tie and cocoon sleeve styling but i recommend trying on before deciding truly stunning athough the weight of the silk is very light would have been better at this price point if it was heavier weight but still not a bad value
"this top is very beautiful and the color is a dream but wow is it short im  and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt i wouldnt recommend this to women who are bustycurvy on top it made my chest look huge this styling may work for petite ladies but tall  curvy ladies beware"
i guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down but i am not a fan of the design i felt the color scheme was very plain the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to nor does it hide imperfections it truly is comfort we
this has become a goto work staple in my closet soft with a relaxed fit makes this a very easy piece to work the day away in while still pulling off a dressy casual appropriate for my office highly recommend
ag jeans have become my favorite and these didnt disappoint ridiculously comfortable i think they run a tad big but maybe not enough to size down just enough to where ill need to wash them more often maybe
love this blouse it fits tts and it accentuates all the right curves the color is a lovely shade of pale peach and while its true that some of the buttons arent cut its an easy fix you just have to take a small pair of sharp scissors and carefully cut the uncut threadsit didnt even take me  minutes to do then you can button or unbutton in whatever way feels comfortable for you it just makes you look and feel effortlessly sophisticated busty girls dont be shyi have a  h bus
this blouse is so much cuter in person and its more golden than yellow so its not as bright which makes it easier for blondes to wear i tried it on thinking id never be able to pull the color off but loved it enough to try and wow so perfect i had to get it and it was on sale love this and happy to add it to my antro collection
vegan suede makes these sound fancier than they are i love them and theyre super cozy and a nice change from plain leggings but theyre just a microfiber legging which makes the price about  too high even for retailer still im sure ill wear them plenty i usually wear a  and the xs fit me which makes me think theyd be too large for a size 
beautiful color for fall sleeves are a bit long and loose but otherwise a great blouse for work i recommend sizing down
i loved this top when i tried it on im usually a small or medium and ordered the medium based on these reviews the only problem with this for me was that you can see through it in the back it showed every lump and bump around my bra reluctantly i am going to return it if you dont have any lumps and bumps i think this is a great top i wish it had worked for me i debated about trying it on with a camisole to see if that would help but dont really want to have to wear a camisole in the
for my body type this top looked ridiculous i am smallbusted and thinnish on top this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me very unflattering hard to tell if it was truetosize because it hung so wide i think for a gal with more substantial upper body ie boobs this would work better
i normally wear a  or  at retailer and bought this in a  the size  is even a tad small in the bust area but not small enough to size to an  i am  for reference for ladies larger than a c cup i would recommend sizing to your larger size definitely try on at the store if you can
"i feel like this top is almost perfect but theres something missing the details are nice the fit is fine but something wasnt right maybe it was the weird arm lengthfits tts if a tad on the large side"
i could not resist this top it is super cute the material is nice and thick you can get away with wearing no bra shows off your bronzed or creamy skin to perfection i cant wait to wear this  i think the cut is very flattering for all figures top might be a bit tight for very big busted ladies though
it must be hard to photograph white clothing this lovely top is almost invisible in the featured photo but it is accurately photographed in the extra photo with the model in a jacket this will feel and look great with cardigans or cropped stylish jackets im so glad i ordered this lovely white lacey top and i do recommend it to you i only dinged it one star because it would be even better in cotton and silk which are frequent tiny brand materials i went with the size large as this be

i dont know who this would fit looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress    but just looked like a sack i think the knit must have stretched into an unnatural shape  especially the arms
this blouse is so beautiful and feminine it fits loosely and is see thru so you do need to wear a cami underneath it it is very comfortable to wear i got many compliments when i wore this blouse all the delicate lace on it just makes you feel very pretty in it however be extra careful when you do wear it im still not quite sure how it happened but the lace in the front got a small hole right in the front on my first time wearing it its so pretty i just hope i can get it fixed so it w
yep i used to have a nice body but now have the dreaded menopause stomach and some excess baggage this dress was very flattering wore it today easter sunday and had literally a dozen people seek me out to tell me how great the dress was or how nice i looked it is a bright pink think pepto bismol heavy brocade type fabric plus a great cut  hiding my stomach and rear plus the lower neckline emphasized my nicer areas very pleased to find a dress for us older women to look fresh and f
"i knew i would love this dress it looked so me my order arrived and sadly to say it looks awfuli was expecting  sleeves these were to the bottom of my wrist i could have been fine with that but the entire dress was so big on me it looked like a sack i usually wear a sz  or sm this was a small will returnif you can find one that fits i would recommend it"
i bought this sweater in the lovely lilac and black the sweater is a typical cotton weave in the front with more of a tshirt material on the back the drape is lovely after a quick iron swingy with a flirty neckline my middle us still recovering from baby  and this does a nice job of covering the bump interestingly i think they went overboard on the fabric and pleats and i could easily have down sized  from a large wear size  to a medium
this is a super comfortable and flattering dress and i get compliments every time i wear it highly recommend
i ordered two sizes when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin both shirts were in the bag the style is just okay the shirt is extremely light weight i was not impressed with the fabric i am returning both definitely did not think it was worth the price
"this dress is amazing it fits true to size very flattering and the fabric is beautifuli am  and it felt a little long for me so i am having it hemmed up one inch but others may like the hemline just as it is i like my dresses just right above my knee and it was hitting in the middle of my kneejust love everything about it and would definitely recommend it highly"
i bought the lavender one and im so glad i did the sweater looks prettier in person and its super soft the back detailing makes this one not your average vneck sweater i highly recommend this to anyone
this dress is just as it appears it is very well made lined and falls in heavier but fluid waves the bodice fit snug and the zipper worked almost perfectly  the color is very pink like pepto bismal but not in a bad way if thats possible my husband loved the dress on me but my  year old daughter thought it was too pink too girly i think i decided it was just too young for me im   alas i am returning it but i still think fondly of this piece i am   lbs and i bought

love the crochet and and it is a great feel with a liner underneath that comes with the dress a little boxy but another beautiful retailer dress overall 
i have to admit seeing these tops online i wouldnt give them a second glance but at my local store they were displayed in a gorgeous summery fashion and were so light and airy and flowy my summer checklist i bought both the blue and rust color in an xl i am a  and this is one of the few button up shirts that actually fit i think i might go in and add a snap between the bust line anyway since the buttons are spaced too generously but there is no pulling this top does run long

this would be one of my favorite shirts if the neckline were straight across instead of cut or if it at least had a button it runs large so the low neck plus bagginess makes it feel too loose for my taste even though i ordered the xs the back of the sweater is also really long its a comfortable fabric and nice quality though
the wine color is beautiful and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one however both fabrics are thin and the back is quite see through the knit shows every single bodily imperfection so if you are the quintessential tall and thin and you dont mind showing your bra go for it otherwise i suggest skipping this one

i was really excited to receive this dress its a fun concept and different from anything else i have however the dress was way too short on me im  ft  in and the size medium was way too short given the thin nature of the material i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress even for wearing it outside the office i will have to return this dress
i ordered this in cream during the  sale i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty but it was not my size so i didnt try it on when it arrived it was a wrinkled mess it was so wrinkled that i dont think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular it was also way too short for me ill be taking it back very soon i do plan
this tunic is very cute and incredibly comfortable it is a bit loose but you can see that on the model that it hangs off the body i lose my waist a little bit in this but think its a good substitute for a thin sweatshirt and the button detail at the neck is nice if you want to show a little cleavage
plan to order at least one size smaller than you think its way baggy
this is a beautiful tunic the colors are vibrant and the stitching is high quality please note that the insets on the sides are not actual stitching but a print it is still very pretty please size down a size i am usually a large wearing a  or  if something runs tight across the bust i ordered a large and it is a bit big under the arms but too big through the waist area i am not small in this area eitheri would recommend buying this tunic
i bought this dress for summer celebrations the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down very feminine and has a romantic feel
i think this dress is cute it caught my eye in the store and i got a bunch of compliments when i tried it on i like the sunny yellow i plan on wearing it to an outdoor wedding on the amalfi coast of italy in the spring i am petite    and purchased a size  i think it may run a little tight in the chest so perhaps consider sizing up if you have average or larger breasts i love the pockets the fabric seems to wrinkle easily so hopefully i wont be too rumpled after having it

love the color fit and feel of these jeans  the thin material is stretchy and comfortable i didnt have to pull them up every so often during a  hour party  they didnt bag out after the first wearing and are true to size  i got a     the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle  the rise wasnt too low for me  highly recommend

i didnt think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold yes it is seethrough but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work the best feature even though its silk and the tag says dry clean only you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles i took my usual small im  and  lbs and love how versatile this blouse will be
the mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasnt pretty on me plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion it does run big  i ordered m and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy too bad though because its a pretty shirt and different
im very glad i snatched this up when i did it is super soft and the perfect length i love the slight peplum as it makes for a very flattering fit i can tell this shirt will be a staple year round as it works great with shorts or jeans for me i think the large was a tiny bit big in the waist but it might shrink in the wash the armholes were nice too and didnt gap
i love this top its the perfect lightweight top for summer and the details are so feminine and pretty the fit is extremely flattering the arm holes are not too large ie do not have to worry about exposing bra i think you can dress it up with heels wear it casually with shorts  also pairs perfectly with kimonos im    and i took my usual retailer size in this size small
i received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure it is longer as it appears on the model i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price
i absolutely love this top and it looks absolutely fabulous the first time you wear it the details are impeccable and youll get compliments all day long i paired it with a jean jacket and my favorite destroyed skinnies for an outing in tx wine country there are a couple of key things to note when you pull this top on mind your makeups you can and will get makeup on the collar and so apply this shirt on carefully or your makeup viceversa now after the fist wear which
i liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me  too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the midsection  going back
i so wanted to love this suit it was gorgeous  the color the quality the style but i am returning and can not recommend it the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun but i didnt feel like i could even walk safely and i am not wellendowed very bummed but its going back

very elegant feel and look love the side zip sliming feature great all around pant to dress up with heals or boots for work
i bought these pants in the green and in black they are the most comfortable work pants ever almost as if you are wearing leggings and not pants the material is really thick hiding any imperfectionsthe satin detail allows for them to be a little more dressy i am  and  and i ordered a  they are a little large in the waist but a perfect fit everywhere else the also hit right below my ankle bone i highly recommend these pants for anybody who is on the go for there job a lot because
cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality they used to be a pretty consistently highquality brand but lately ive been left a little bummed i got this in yellow which is really a muddy orangey color i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily sort of like a soft cheesecloth the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute but the qua
i am loving this shirt i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not for me this is a great substitute for the cloth  stone fringed plaid buttondown dress its definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a tshirt and this on top it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is highly recommend
i had been looking for a new plaid shirt for fall this one is perfect the yellow is muted but i really like it that way other reviewers have commented on poor quality but it doesnt seem that bad to me definitely recommend
"this model looks like a bauble head she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers this last catalogs models are anorexic and unhealthy lookingi ordered this shirt hoping it would fit but its too small for  i am tall athletic and have breasts i think of my shape as average  and the top didnt fit its cut narrow and small"
purchased this tee online and could not be happier with what arrived in my mailbox this tee is perfect to throw on to run errands or out to lunch the fabric is so soft fit is true to size i dont like tight fitting shirts if you do i suggest ordering down a size overall great detail fit and just as pictured
this shirt is made of fabric so soft you can practically feel it with your eyes i saw it right when i walked into the store and knew that i had to have it it is unlike any fabric ive ever had a soft twoply almost gauzy cotton one cute detail is that the inside layer is a smaller windowpane plaid than the outside layer so cute and so soft one thickness above cheesecloth i would say and like cheesecloth it has a natural give within the weave but it is not stretchy the shoulders
the color is a very dark mustard yellow thinlightweight material and it has a pretty feminine drape  a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt cute cuffs complementary design the top was baggier than the bottom though i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in im usually between a sm i recommend the size up for hip fit
i dont usually write reviews but i loved this dress in the store and would have passed it right over online the skirt is a charcoal color and the top is an antique white it gives the appearance of a separate crop top i would usually wear a small  and  lbs im wearing a small in the photo but ended up going back for an xs the dress could go more casual with flats or boots and a scarf or dressier with heels and jewelry i think ill get a lot of use out of it
i purchased the violet chinos in my local store the color to me is more plum than violet but a nice shade still the fit was perfect and they are oh so comfortable i bought size  weight fluxes  i can see having several pairs of these in other colors because of the comfort level and they work for fall spring and summer in the warmer states even winter the fabric has a soft feel to it
i bought these in pink and added taupe to my wardrobe because one pair is not enough i found a tiny variation in size between my two pairs but for the most part they are true to size i love the just below the navel rise they pair well with strappy or fringe sandals i havent worn them with boots yet however i think theyll be great since they hug in close to the calf and ankle without being tight buy them in the size you buy jeans or one waist size smaller if youre sometimes this or some
loved these pants when i bought them but was not expecting them to grow a size within an hour of putting them on i think its an issue with pilcro great styling nice fabric but buy one size down
as other reviewers have stated it is hard to see in the photos that the dress has iridescent bluepinklavender sequins i was surprised as well but in a good way i think it has a unique look and is so pretty and romantic its a vision of shimmer when you are walking if you have somewhat of a bust i would size up because the triangles run a little small other than that its a beautiful dress
i was disappointed in this vest it was stiff and scratchy and seems too big doesnt drape well fromm the armpit and bust line area not very figure flattering looks like i put a blue shopping bag on and belted it to try to add flair
i wear stuff like this a lot so naturally i got this one i love it and i think its flattering however it wrinkles easily and also when i hand washed in cold water it shrunk a little which super irritating but im going to wear it anyway i think it can be worn with many things so itll stay in rotation a while

this is a relatively cute top when you try it on however i dont think it will hold its shape after even just  wear it also doesnt seem like you could wash it without ruining it like a shirt form a throwaway cheap clothing store i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high  viscose  meaning it wont last long at all im returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is

i really love the feel of the fabric on this dress when you first take it from the package it resembles a tent but once you figure out how to scrunch the front and back around the straps it resembles the photo the fabric is very soft and the indigo colors are amazing this dress is perfect over a swimsuit or for casual gatherings you can even dress it up with a belt it is somewhat sheer but does look cute with a cropped jacked over it
"i bought this dress for a holiday party and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo i still liked it but when i went to try it on it was just not working i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted i would recommend sizing up but be aware that the top straps shoulder to breast are too loose to begin with so they may sagoverall i wouldnt recommend this dress for the curren"

i have a curvy figure and this top is not for me it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom it is also short i think this top works best on slender figures
the embroidery on this top is pretty but i think blue is more of a navygrey in person and the embroidery seemed darker brown im  and tried an xs and small the small definitely fit better in length the body of thr blouse is loose almost boxy cute top just not what im looking for
eyelash sweaters are all so soft and cuddly but this is the only one ive found what doesnt make me look like a bear the shoulder cutouts really help create a   flattering silhouette im  the medium fits well slightly loose so the sleeve below the cut out hangs slightly highly recommend
this gorgeous sky blue sweater was already in the dressing room to try on i was not shopping for anything like this whatsoever well i tried it on and decided it was a mustbuy i usually need a petite in sweaters and coats but this one because i prefer a longer length fits just fine and the sleeves are not too long the color is beautiful it seems to be warm enough for sf evenings it think the price is quite reasonable for a sweatercoat like this a great purchase
i love this sweater the sky color is very flattering in person i love that it looks good open or closed i bought one for my mom and me i think it will be very versatile i think it runs mostly true to size possibly runs just slightly big

this is an amazing sweater thick but not overly thick the material is beautiful and the colors rich i love the collar and the way it closes as well as the pockets and the back being different from the front i hope it washes well i bought the moss it fits nicely and is very slimming i highly recommend
i originally bought this in a petite xs i am   tall on a good day sometimes longer sweaters can overwhelm me but the petite was almost a bit snug and short in the arms i exchanged it for a regular xs and while i now have to cuff the sleeves the overall look is much better i bought the gray but really liked the blue and moss too will be very nice for the frigid days we have in ohio looks great with leggings tucked into boots i think a winner
i wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen the folds on top added too much to my frame i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes for all others it is incredibly soft and warm the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous
i was searching for an ivory cardigan and i ordered this in my usual size small and an extra small after trying them both on the xs looked better i like a more fitted look a tad tight i the arms when layered but otherwise would have been a good fit but the acrylic in this garment was too itchy for me around the neck i thought this might be the case but took a chance anyway also the pockets add a bit of bulk in the hip area definitely not something i want
the other reviewers have already adequately praised this very attractive sweater but id like to add that the sizing is large i fit perfectly into a regular small although regular medium is my usual size i am    size  top the medium swamped me the shoulders and sleeves were comical and the body too big i imagine many of you are scoping out this lovely comfy piece youll want to hit the right size the first time my store didnt get the coral so i cant speak for that b
i was surprised at how soft this is it also has snaps under each arm for definition and on front for closure didnt know that and love it got yesterday in mail wore out last night highly recommend
this is a great piece to add to your wardrobe the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great i got the pink which surprised me because i wear so much black the length fits longer than most rompers which is great it makes it a classic fit i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up the waist has elastic but its snug

"quite possibly one of the most flattering beautiful and effortlessly romantic dresses i have ever tried on and to top it off it has a sweet surprise the silk slip on the inside of the dress has the same print as the outside shell and it is so lovely that if you feel like wearing something short and sweet you can wear the slip as its own dressruns true to size to maybe just a little bit bigif you have a smaller bustline and narrow hips you might be able to size downits cr"
"ive been hesitant to try on rompers in part because they seem complicated and i also too worry that i would look a bit like mutton disguised as lamb in one of them however i saw this romper and fell in love with the pattern and had to try it on the pattern and color are wonderful and i instantly felt glamorous like betty grable in a cute cheesecake photograph i had to buy it and have since received tons of compliments on it and i have yet to feel that i am too one foot in the grave t"
this romper is cute i wont deny that however the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly however the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders im short but have a little wider shoulders so perhaps that was the issue it seems like another reviewer had the same problem there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down so i had to do some cont
they look good in the front as well the back i would go a size down in them though as they stretch out throughout the day i love hei hei and would recommend this pant
i got this dress on sale under  dollars but i would pay more  it runs very large  i got a medium which is roomy irl i wear a large vanity sizing i suppose  the colors are so pretty it is lined so you dont need a slip or cami  highly recommend
buy it buy it right now this dress is gorgeous and would be on anyone i dont care what size you are its so pretty that you feel pretty in it i loved wearing it and since i am in florida i can wear it all year long so its worth it happy very happy with this purchase
i am pretty standard size     lbs i ordered the small and the bust fit well but the whole thing was like a tent and way too flowy for my taste it was also long so everything was very covered i  feel it flattered my build i returned
after multiple purchase and returns from other sites i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation located beach side this dress was better than i could have hoped the fit is very flattering loose  tight in all the right places the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather the slight train  back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise casual floral pattern i would highly recommend
i loved the idea of these pants as ive been looking for an updated pair of tuxedo pants i wear  in most of my jeans im not super skinny  consider my legs medium not too skinny  not too athletic i tried these on in xs  european as marked on them  they were big around the waist  hip area there was so much gap in the back which made them look frumpy i did however liked the length the fabric is nice  heavy which i also loved sadly these didnt work for me though really wish t
i absolutely love these pants they are so incredibly comfortable and fit is amazing they look awesome with sandals and boots and will transition perfectly into fall i definitely recommend sizing down like the other reviewers have suggested i originally purchased my normal size  but they were loose after wearing a little around the house i decided to exchange them for a  and they were a little snug at first but stretched out and fit perfect
"needed a pair of grey pants to go with some of my jewel colored topshei hei is my favorite brand of pants and these did not disappoint  they fit like a glove and are true to size  i dont think the picture does them justice  if you like comfort you certainly will not go wrong with these pants  you can wear them year round except in the heat of the summer  i would not hesitate to purchase them"
a fun casual romper i loved the pink color not usually my thing which looks great with darker skin like another reviewer said the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes i took a size  in this but am usually a   this will make the top part a bit blousy but i think that adds to the appeal look

"really this top feels like a wonderfully expensive soft silk knit it is just so very soft the drape is really nice and there is stretch to it making it very comfortable it does have a tendency to fall towards the body even though its loose so id buy your regular sizeits a thin material but i dont think its sheer at all i bought the dark redwine color and its so classy i love it this will fit taller women easily because the arms and total length are on the long side i sup"
this dress is timeless so cute on and fits easily i like that it has long sleeves yet it is a light fabric comfortable and stylish that is for me i am taking it this weekend to nyc for a trip i think i will fit right in
i saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous i could not wait when i tried it on it is such a loose top and a tad short it was flowy all over i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings i dont recommend it for a curvy figure just not flattering makes everything look big what a waste because the print is so nice
this is a beautiful coat no one has mentioned how beautifully the pattern matches even across the arms coordinating with the front i love the lower button as it allows for arm movement and contributes to the casual slouch the only complaint i have is there is a slight dark spot above both pockets this appears to be a sewers mark for placement i think i have figured out how to disguise it without marring the fabric but second item from retailer with marks quality control i am keeping th
this top is a very comfortable very easy top to wear it is perfect for laying with work clothes or styling a bit more casually for just wearing out and about i ordered it in the light blue color and it is beautiful very soft and feminine the ruffle lays really well down the front which i was concerned about because of how busty i am i ordered a small and it fits just right i think the knit back really helps with that very nice
this dress is lovely albeit darker than it appears on the website but i had to return it runs way smalli usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve this brand and could not even get this l on would really only recommend for xs or s ladies maybe m who have the possibility of going larger if you do purchase absolutely size up  sizes
this is a gorgeous dress the color is absolutely stunning and looks true to the photos online the dress is a little too short and tight for a work dress but too thick for a summer dress it would be perfect for a date night but since i have enough date dresses and not that many datesi opted not to purchase it is gorgeous but i would suggest sizing up because i could barely zip in my standard size and the seams would definitely give after sitting
this vest kept catching my eye online i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater which is fabulous when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest  sweater the more i looked at these pictures the more i fell in love with the vest needless to say i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts its incredibly soft  a great piece to add to your wardrobe
as others have mentioned the proportions of this coat are a bit strange but i do like the oversized feel and the low button it is really soft and i like the beige lining too theres room for a sweater under it so layered it is probably warm enough for temperatures in the high thirties and warmer what makes me a little crazy about iti almost returned it because of thisis that the stripes dont match up on the seams they are slightly off and i think the coat cost enough that a mistake

i received this coat today and im ecstatic about my purchase i am a true petite and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews yes the button is low but that is the style i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short otherwise the fit may be completely off
these pants fit wonderfully perfect for casual day i had planned at a music festival when it was still a little chilly out they fit just like my skinny ag jeans but have a more relaxed feel in that they uber skinny held up well all day
"i just tried these jeans on out of the box and they fit like a dream im   and the  my usual size fit me exactly right as fulllength skinny jeans they taper perfectly no hemming required they are super comfy and nice and thick they feel durable and high qualitytwo suggestions for improvement  i wish is that they were a uniform dark blue wash but the fadng and whiskering is barely noticeable  i also wish theyd place the butt pockets a little higher especia"
there is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip instead it has an elastic waist it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist i am  and a size  it runs a bit large  i think this is due to the elastic waste
"i did not even pause over this dress on line  a white lace dress now well my local retailer at lenox atlanta  which has a petites department  had this dress in the window with a jean jacket being a lace geek i went in to find it i am a big fan of the feminine and dressy dressed down great window display ideathis picture does not do anything for the dress except wash out the true color the lining is ivory  that vintage sepia photo look ivory the lace is lovely ivory too and the"
"this is a very pretty delicate comfortable dress i think it fits tts  maybe even a little large i got the ps which is my usual size and it fit perfectlythe only complaint i have is that the photo is misleading on the dress i received there was nothing to hook the buttons into no loops as in the photo so the whole front of the dress has to be unbuttoned i wish i was able to button  or  as in the photo"

such a cute dress i ordered the black version im large busted dd and the slip thankfully fit sometimes it doesnt im   and went ahead with the regular not petite version and i have to say i think the petite would have been too short the dress comes to the top of my knees as photographed on the model highly recommend

this tshirt hits at a great length not too long so it doesnt make me feel top heavy but it flows enough to hide any imperfections    i ordered a medium
"this dress is pretty but there were a few things i dislikedthe overdress is fairly shapeless however the slip is fitted and well above the knee since the overdress is sheer the shortness of the slip is visible the fabric of the overdress felt rough on my skin i did like the contrast of textures between the overdress the slip and the lace finally as other reviewers have shared the buttons are not functional and the vneck of the overdress is deep i recommend trying the dress"
this t is a beautiful color and i wish it had worked it is quite flimsy however  very thin cotton fabric without the nice drape that would have made this look good on i also think it should have been cut a little longer it flares out right at the hipsso instead of covering them it highlights them im disappointed and am returning it
great pop of color i purchased the rosy color and great piece you can add layers to it drapes beautifully may run a tad larger but not enough to size down light weight so wear alone for warmer fall days or as we get into spring and with a scarf and jacket for cooler days
the print layers and fit of this dress remind me of the  but in a good way the outer dress is voluminous and flowy so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top i really appreciate that styling detail    and i chose medium regular length not petite since im older and wanted the length
this is a must have for summer im always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesnt look right the short sleeves are just what ive been looking for every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms so i think for everyone else your normal jacket size should be perfect
i am a huge fan of pilcro pants and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants the idea is great  leather in the front fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look however i couldnt get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees  really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around cant bend the leg all the way weird creasing and bunching behind the knee the fit was perfect everywhere else sadly these had to go back 
i really wanted to like these but they just didnt look right on my  sorta bulky frame i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings so maybe im just not the right target for these but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try the waist was too high for my liking and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look
i am sadly returning this dress but i would recommend it it is soft and i loved the design of the dress very comfortable the only reason i am returning it is due to my figure it is a fitted dress and was a little more revealing that i would have liked
i think this is a really flattering dress i like the length of the sleeves theyre not long like in retailers very first navy photo but all the other pics are accurate in my opinion in my photo im wearing an xs regular so id say its shorter than  because im only  and its above my knee it may run slightly small because im a  with a  waist  hips and usually wear xspetite in retailer but this xs fits me fine although to get it to be fitted at the waist xxs might be bet

these are such a great alternative to actual leather pants they have the perfect amount of stretch and breathability ive always found leather pants to be too hot  got the holly color unfortunately the p size was sold out but as another reviewer noted these are easy to roll up i noticed some of the complaints about quality and these not holding up but given the use of two different materials pu and a stretchy material i think its only natural that these would tear along the seams aft
i bought this dress for a dinner after my daughters wedding rehearsal it is perfect it is dressy enough for the occasion it also has a casual look to it i think it is very versatile i fell in love with the colors material and the quality i am more excited about this dress then the dress i am wearing to the wedding buy it youll love it
as you can tell from the pictures its nothing fancy i think this dress will get a lot of wear for everyday living simple and comfy reviewers said it ran pretty small so i sized up but wished i hadnt it is not very fit
i purchased the navy size small and was delighted with the fit the waist line is perfectly proportioned for a petite i think this means that the waist line will be high on a woman who needs regular sizing i like the lining it adds a substantial look to the dress
i loved these pants the minute i put them on and was so happy id ordered them but i wore them only  times  and only at dinners with friends not even for full days  and the seams on both legs ripped open i think the faux leather just isnt equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings i was superbummed about this because these pants are so insanely cute but if they cant hold up to a few casual wears then theres just no way thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom
i bought the navy version of this dress in the store and thought it looked pretty nice i am  and  pounds and the small fit me great i think that the dress looks exactly like it does in the pictures at least for the particular color that i bought the length comes about midthigh as shown and i would definitely have worn it to work after looking in the mirror for a few more days though i decided to return the dress because i didnt feel like the shape of it was especially sensati

these jeans look amazing on hug every curve in just the right waythe long length with flareadd a platform heel and i look like i have legs for days and my booty will definitely turn some heads total splurge but for a great pair of jeans totally worth it ordered my usual size  and they fit like a dream hope they dont stretch out after wearing a few hours the amount of stretch feels nice so i think theyll continue to hug your body if you want  pair of flares in your wardrobe
these tanks are very soft i have two black and one coral i had to return the white as it was see through they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if youre in between sizes i recommend these tanks for sure
i was surprised to find this jacket on sale and i dont mind  its a trend of the season and i absolutely dont mind to look like a mattress or wear robe the garment runs large so i wear usually  and have to get xs i am   lbs usually wear sm in jackets it hits me  inches below my knee i love it

beautiful spring dress perfect for luncheons or any occasion so very pretty lovely fabric and good fit you will definitely feel pretty in this dress y daughter is  and the length was perfect
"i never write reviews but i just purchased this top at full price last week in the store its not a have to have top just to look at it but once i put it on i had to have it its extremely comfortable and i am able to wear it while running around with my boys and still feel as though im put together ive worn this top now  times and after the  wear i have  holes in the area where the waist line of my jeans sits the first time i wore this top it was for only and hour or so what a"
i own this tank in three different colors and have been wearing them since the weather warmed up they are soft good quality and wash up well ive taken them on vacation as they take up no room in my suitcase and also have used them as little camisole shirts they dont fit too tight on just right i think you could also use them with pajama bottoms to sleep in
this jacket is beautiful the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect however one i put it on i couldnt wait to get it off its so itchy i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable especially around my neck i wouldnt recommend this jacket based on the material alone also the jacket runs large im   lbs  and i ordered the small i would definitely size down
i like this top in the photo the white in the print stands out inperson the white areas of the print not embroidery is dull more like beige the flowers and embroidery itself looks good the print looks good it is a swing top looks better on a slender frame such loose fitting tops just dont look good on my curvy frame i sized down could have tried  sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops
most peasant tops have a lot of detail at the chest such as gathering yoke inlay ties etc i like this peasant blouse because it has a simple top part so it does not add volume to the chest good for busty figures pretty top though colors a bit more autumnal than pictured
love this top and i think it is a great transition piece  i live in texas so our temps stay high until october this top in the purple motif color is perfect since the colors arent look too summery but the fabric is lightweight this top is a little bit boxy but drapes nicely so it wont make you look wide as with most holding horses tops this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length
i got these on sale midsummer at retailer and they quickly became my goto summer slacks for the office i work in washington dc and jerusalem  two really hot cities  and these are comfortable yet professional with a sleeveless blouse jacket and heeled sandals they are professional with flat sandals and a tshirt perfect for a weekend they travel quite well and dont instantly wrinkle the way most linen slacks do think ahead to next summer and grab them
this is such a beautiful shirt for me tts i bought the size   it is a very detailed and tailored shirt so i can understand if your busty why you may have to size up the attention to detail along with the embroidered butterflies sets this shirt a step above average the color is an odd shade of olive but i like it and the butterflies have areas that you can see through but not in an immodest way i do not feel the need to wear anything under it
this picture does not do this skirt justice it is gorgeous however the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device unfortunately it was the largest size so i cant size up im  so the length was perfect  it came to right above my knees i love the skirt so much that im considering liposuction
i like what they were going for here and the fabric but it falls short in that i cant wear it to workthe back keyhole is massive so i cant wear my normal bras and the very wide neck also shows bra straps so unless i want to go with a strapless bra its not useful for me i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that id go without but that is a nono where i work i may try getting a size smaller i wear a med and i got a small and mayb
"ive been shopping at retailer since  and floreat used to be my favorite designer but for the past year or more floreat mostly misses the mark this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model  it is long on her not so in real life this is probably the worst part about this blouse if it were not for this i might try on a size m and give it another chance it runs very large i usually take a l or xl i think i would need a m in this as mentioned above in the picture t"
"i agree with the other reviewers this top is completely disappointing in every way i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag where to beginit runs really bigits short and boxy not at all like it appears on the model this must be pinned a lot in this picturecolors are completely dull in person i really think this picture was lightened a great dealfabric feels cheap and stifflining is stuff and poorly sewni havent one positive thing to say about t"
cute and simple  nice fabric its a looser fit so if youre in between sizes id recommend the smaller size
i ordered this top in xsp and xs i dont think i let the xsp top breathe long enough because i thought it was too short and sent it back there is no retailer near me i kept the xs and at first thought the same thing about it not fitting right but by the end of the day it stretched just enough and felt just right really pretty top i received a lot of compliments on it
i love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though
this wool jacket actually feels more as a cardigan its a little too thin for a jacket but looks about the same as pictured its very pretty i ordered a l and it was true to size sleeves are cropped the wool material is surprisingly soft and comfortable very nice and colorful addition to my closet recommend 
i just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small  at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldnt even know its not real leather the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and its so neat how it goes with so many outfits the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to its
i was looking for something to wear for an event at an art gallery i actually really loved this dress i think it hides body flaws i tired on the xs but the small was a little more flowing it was comfortable and very fun to wear i am short so the length was great for me i wore a different full length black slip under it which was more comfortable for me go try it on too see if it fits for your body style it was great for me
"i tried on the dress that was returned at my store in xxs p i would not have based on reviews but my stylist asked me to try it on it does look nice you just have to cinch it all the way perhaps most people do need to size down for my  lbs   waist i wouldnt go up to xs p to give an idea material is nice and sturdy give ti a try"
this top is so cute its my go to top dress up or down looks really cute with skinny skirt i have the ivory and just ordered the dark grey one great thing this top has pockets i would buy this in many colors if i could yes its full but a cute full but i love full tops i think this is true to size its not tight and i dont think it would be as cute tight i actually like mine on me better than the one on the modellol washes like a dream and you can dry it in the dryer

i saw this in my local retailer and was blown away by how soft it was the minute i tried it on i didnt want to take it off for being a boxy cut it was surprisingly flattering i have a large chest and normally wear an xl in retailer clothes but i could easily zip the size large all the way up this is the perfect hoodie to wear running errands on the weekend or with a pretty blouse on under it at work i know ill get a ton of use out of it so i recommend it
another winner for me this top drapes wonderfully the lace is beautiful and looks fabulous on i would highly recommend it
this dress is very good quality with beautiful beading on the bodice its a heavier material than i was expecting but that was a pleasant surprise unfortunately when i put it on and looked in the mirror i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and combined with the overall design and length i couldnt think of anywhere to wear it this is an easy return for me the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit
after reading the other reviews i had to write my own i think this dress is adorable it is a tunic and advertised as such i think the drawcord and the way it is styled is really different and gives the dress some pop i am  so the length is good for me i didnt have trouble with the arms as some did the slip was a problem  too small especially considering the dress is a tunic and fits as a tunic the dress fits me as it does the model with a pair of cute boots this dress rocks

this dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same not cute not flattering the model photo is deceiving would not recommend although it looks airy and comfy
im a petite girl  and  ordered regular size xs since others mentioned this being short or cropped this sweater is adorable not itchy in my opinion and the lenght is just right not short not long however it may be a bit short for tall girlsstill think its worth a try

the collar on this jacket is amazing there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness the print contains vibrant colors  perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions when you snap it the material gets bunchy and awkwardfitting so its best to wear it as a wrap it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of
"the previous review by beardedlady said it best yes i do still feel like a little girl playing dress up in it but i dont care this is a fun creative dress to be worn on the days when you feel like having a julie andrews moment in my own opinion i dont think i can wear this without a topper covering the poufy shoulders so im happy that i own the dara moto jacket in plum to toughen up the look i am  and the bodice feels a little loose all over with the size  re"

i had my eye on this jacket in moss for awhile i was afraid the vegan leather wouldnt feel natural or soft but i was wrong its wonderfully soft  so much so that every time i wear it and tell someone its vegan leather they feel compelled to touch it and cant get over the quality the detailing is great and the back adds a special interesting touch its become my goto jacket and works just as well with jeans as it does with a nice dress and who doesnt love getting a compliment every

soft elegant beautiful and makes me feel special what more could one ask for fit is true to size and has various styling options best retailer purchase in some time
one word obsessed feel like a carrie bradshaw bohemian queen sturdy and luxurious pretty fancy definitely queenworthy  walzing around my house in this dress listening to john mayer and feeling fab
i saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers its super comfy i bought with the intention of wearing it out not just around the house i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it ive been opting for tights lots of compliments so far i got a small because i didnt want it to be too short it fits well
i wanted to love this romper but it just wasted right for me i am    curvymuscular frame and ordered size small i may have liked it better with more room in the medium decided to return i still recommend trying this product but it wasnt for me and my hips
i purchased this top in both colors while on sale it fits true to size the material is heavier than i expected but that just means it should hold up for a long time recommend
i have been staring at these shorts since they first appeared and finally decided to treat myself to them for my birthday when they came in the mail i was so excited and they in person are even more beautiful and well made then in the picture but be warned these shorts are rather short so if you dont mind showing a bit of leg these will be right up your alley
i absolutely love these shorts i do however feel they run on the large side i am  and normally wear a    or  and bought these in an xs i would have gotten an xxs if they were available but that was not an option they are a little baggy but they are so great i could not pass them up these are too good to pass on
loved the look of this shirt online i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated almost looks as if im ready for take off unfortunately none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size  i would have loved it looks great from the side but sadly i cant walk around like that

these are gorgeous and not too short or too long which is oddly hard to find theyre mostly tts but if youre between sizes id go up a size because the small was slightly snug on me and im a  im hopeful that theyll stretch a little with wear because i think the medium would be too loose
i truly feel guilty wearing these outdoors it is incredibly comfortable so much so that i asked the sales girl if these were pjs or actually worn out im usually between a s and m both fit fine but i went with the m to have a bit more room and allow the top to be a bit more flannel flowy the top has enough length that i can actually let it droop over the waist bet a bit the length is definitely upper thigh on me    but rest assured nothing is hanging out its actually the p
this is the softest flannel ever while i dont think id wear it outside it is super comfy just lounging around it runs very large but since its a flannel romper not a problem absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes

i am very particular about jeans its not just the look its the feel and the quality of the fabric that won me over the midrise wideleg crop is perfection im  and a size  these are extremely flattering and versatile to go casual or incorporate into a more professional feel great way to show off some of the fabulous fall footwear options as well i highly recommend

love this dress  i tried it on at the store and loved how it felt on i put it on hold to think about it and returned later that day to purchase i am glad i did the  day i wore it i received numerous compliments
this top is gorgeous dress it up for work or wear with jeans for a more casual look the top fits true to size and the lace is not overdone  i would recommend this and cant wait to wear it
beautiful detail and soft sweater i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short arms were long and baggy in comparison given the fit i didnt think the small would work really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back
i think i received a mislabeled vest when i opened the package i thought it was some sort of joke  i was expecting what the stock photos show a longer length flowy sweater vest mine was literally child sized im not a big person at all im   lbs and wear a  i ordered this in a ml thinking i would like it loose i tried it on thinking maybe it will look longer once on no not even i looked ridiculous the front hit above the waist of my jeans and the back hit middl
i love this sweater its so soft and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it it runs true to size but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more it seems to stretch a little overall i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it
i was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining in addition the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba
i liked this bc it is long ivory and thin i think it will be a versatile piece to wear with tees  casual dresses it has a little hook  button closure up on one shoulder if you wish to wear it more as a wrap looks cute that way too
these pants were pretty different then my typical style but i love them they come down a bit longer then i think they are supposed to because i have shorter legs but i still think they are cute especially with a heel or clog good quality well made

"this is a beautiful dress and i would recommendbut it was short on me tall not the midi i was hoping for and a little too low cut too much cleavage im a d cupsince i paid full price i have to be completely pleased with my purchase for this reason i will return maybe if i had bought it on sale price then i would keep"
this dress is gorgeous in color and print i think it can be styled as eclectic or elegant as youd like definitely runs big in the shoulderbodice area so i sized down
i wanted a dress that made me feel pretty while traveling when we went out in the evening nothing really fancy but nice i saw this right when it came out and the colors and cut were exactly what i was looking for i am   and normally a size  in retailer dresses but i have a  chest and a little broader ribcage even though my shoulders and hips are small  which can be tricky the fit and flare style helps a lot but only if the torso is not too tight i went back and forth over the si
i am  approx  lbs  in jeans size  in dresses purchased these in a size  i would suggest sizing up between one to two sizes as a result the upper thigh portion of the shorts do appear a little baggier  plus pleats  can be overwhelming in terms of material  but not so baggy that it would make it circus tentlike do not expect these to be fitteddefinitely a fun pair of shorts seems like it will go well with sandals espadrilles wedges paired with either a fronttucke
wore it this weekend and the compliments were overflowing its exceptionally flattering for busty women im a  i had to size down from an  to a  but even the  looked good just a bit loose in the bodice v neck is just right not too low not too high print is gorgeous in person  colors are much richer than the online photo the flowy skirt is very slimming and forgiving for hourglass and pear shaped body types but if you have slim hips you might feel like youre swimming in fabr
this dress is beautifully tailored and so flattering i feel very comfortable wearing it to work because of the sleeves and neckline but think it would also be good to wear out im so happy i bought it

i adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit i wear a size  and took the risk of ordering the  as a popback but they do fit  sizes small i could get them zipped but its not a good look i feel like the waist would fit if the rise werent so short for reference i have a  waist and  hips
gorgeous colors high quality my only word of caution is that the top part is very tight if you have a large chest c this is going to be snug or not fit at all im wearing it now in pregnancy but i think it will also look great postpartum can be dressed up or down
tracy reese always pleases this coat is absolutely awesome it is gorgeous the faux fur is soft and cozy this coat is warm i love the snap closure this is the sort of attire that makes you feel lovely and is cheerful for those dull winter days so happy to have in my wardrobe a collectors item for sure
what a fun dress to wear it feels great and looks great i feel good when i wear it if i was a kid i would wear it everyday ha ha
i just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear
i at first only intended to try this jacket on and get a feel for the fit and style as ive been looking for springfall inbetween weather outerwear but i unexpectedly and maybe unfortunately for my bank account fell in love instantly the fabric is very soft and the cut is cute stylish and flattering the quality seems good and the fit is perfect i ordered an xs regular in the moss color
i was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived the fabric on the back is thin and clingy i think youd have to wear a slip underneath cute design on the front but sadly its going back
tried this skirt on in the store and loved itso prettyfeminine and versatileexcept for the color although its a gorgeous color and i do love redhow often do people wear red skirts i would have snatched it up if it were offered in other colors unlike the other revieweri think the ruching is great as it gives you the option to wear the skirt higher or lower on your waist and adds the axtra interest factor as this would be a totally frivolous buyim going to resist and try to wait for
i honestly cant say enough wonderful things about this beautiful skirt it is so soft and comfortable very flowy and flattering i have a smaller waist but wider hips and this accentuates all of my best features i highly recommend this skirt for any occasion i wore it to my bridal shower and got soo many compliment and i really couldnt stop touching the material what a wonderful addition to my closet
"the burgundy and black dress is stunning on beautiful cut and colors i thinki do need the petite however the material is not as stretchy as other dresses but the dress does keep its shape"
i bought this dress online because it looked interesting and on sale for  why not i think it looks unassuming on the hanger but on it is fantastic i am    pounds  and the  fit me perfectly it accentuates the curves without revealing anything will be perfect for fallwinter but am going to wear it to a wedding in june where the bride is a vintage loving person so i think with the right shoes and jewelry it will be perfect

this top is so pretty the fabric is absolutely gorgeous and the lace on the collar and back add an elegant old world vibe to this beautiful blouse it is very light and flowy and i can imagine it will be nice and cool for those hot summer days to come i am rather large chested so it does look a little tent like from the side but that is not the case fron the front and honestly i really dont care because it is so comfortable and pretty i know i will wear this top quite a bit this summer
i needed a modest dress with sleeves for a few events and when this went on sale i thought it might fit the bill it does and at under  it was a nobrainer flattering fit attractive tts and the gathers over the middle hide my mommy tummy i like that i can wear a normal bra with it too i can see what other reviewers are saying about the weird feel of the fabric but it doesnt bother me this dress will work well for evening and winter events and im glad its in my closet
the fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful however the fit albeit unique is not extremely flattering in my opinion it may be because i am somewhat of a pearhourglass shape rather than a more straight shape but the fit is a little off imo i am  and  and ordered both the    and felt the  fit a little better
these are called jeans but they arent exactly jean material they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work i like these very much a very slimming effect mid rise which looks very chichighly recommend
i liked the way the dress looked in the front but the material in the back was knit and very clingy i did not think it was flattering on me
this is a good skirt although i think the fabric keeps it from being great it fits well has a good shape and drapes nicely the synthetic material is ok and ill keep it but it may limit the use ill wear it to work but probably not to nicer events
i love this sweater especially the sleeves im  and athletic so i dont feel that it is the most flattering for my figure but i love it so much that i kept it
i tried this dress on in the store it looked frumpy the ruching was not flattering the fabric felt cheap i think for the price there are plenty of other options for dresses than can give you a wow look im   and the  fit fine
this is a beautiful dress blend of materials give it a great feel the cut and style are very flattering colors allow it to be carried over multiple seasons either on its own or layered for colder weather very happy with this investment
i love the style but it didnt work for me i ordered the r size they were way too too long i generally wear size  and the r length works with most retailer pants with this particular pant i could barely pull up the zipper im not sure what happened bc i havent gained any additional weight i am  and  lbs unfortunately i had to return the pants i think the design is for supermodels maybe a petite size would have worked the p was out of stock good luck
beautiful emerald green color in a lovely silk i suggest one size down if youre small chested as the arm holes will fit more snugly
i am typically a  and the dress is true to size xl i live that the embroidery runs the full length of the dress i also like the shimmery side seam detail the front cut near the shoulders is very flattering on one minor issue is a gap in the bosom area due to button placement however i plan to add a snap t i fix i often have this issue as i am large in that area the length is flattering as well and provides great coverage in the rear lightweight and flows nicely the color is wond
this dress is incredibly soft comfortable and essentially lined i mean look at all that intricate embroidery your skin has no idea it is there the colors are lovely the embroidery is sort of a soft peachy cream lined with gold and the dress is even prettier in person the neckline is low but not too revealing and though i normally avoid shirts without sleeves the cut is flattering around my arms the cut of the hem is also flattering in some ways the belt seems like an extra pie
"i really like this dress i tried it on in the store and i had to take it home with me the print is fun and bright and interesting without being over the top the grommets give it a little bit of edgy balance to the sweet flowy shapea note on the the fit i am a  and the  fit well it is a bit loose in some places like the waist but it certainly doesnt look like a maternity dress i think the looseness is a good part of the overall look i am highwaisted and the waistline hit"
love love love this blouse the cut outs at the top just add to its elegance
"i ordered the  p after trying on the regular  and that was better it runs wide the lining is true to size but the overlay is loose the colors are pretty the design is nice but i didnt love it as much as other oneslikes the studs add an edgier look to a almost dainty look flow y sheer fabric the cut is flattering if you get the right size recommend one size downno big dislikeswhy i would still recommend lbs  chest  in waist "

i purchased this dress for a special occasion and am delighted its exactly what i was hoping for everything from the way it fits to the way it feels is perfect i highly recommend it
i disagree with the other reviewsthe colors on this dress are great bright against the black and the studs are super cute and the ties at the cuff are a cute touch fun dress i think its as fitted or not as you want drives me crazy when people get hung up on their size to judge clothes go up or down if it doesnt fit the way you want i like it to flow a little so i sized accordingly
i received this jacket in an  fits great with room  i am a  chest for reference as i was not sure if i needed a  but the  is perfect see my pictures as i feel the website photos are more bright as the actual jacket is more muted buttons are very nice but the pocket flaps hit right at the boob area so it my bother some  very high quality lined and will look great over some retailer dresses in the same color way i purchased last year depending on the season this jacket would do fine
disappointing back is yellowish and looks strange the front view is cute but doesnt match the fabric on the back at all cant imagine why you would do that
"i bought this for my girlfriend with the hope that my presumptive intuition about her style preferences and the fit itself would prove successful fortunately she loves it and looks amazing in itthe colors are vibrant and the unique texture really lends itself toward a clothing item that is special even for retailerrecommend it highly"
i loved this dress on the hanger and loved it more when i tried it on i am usually an  but purchased the  in this dress i preferred the empire waist to be more fitted which the  provided you can decide which look you prefer both looked good i just wanted a less baggy look as one reviewer mentioned the print is cut different on all of the dresses i think the colors pictured online are accurate regarding the snake on the fabric i have several snakes on my dress but not on the back a
i saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had  more left in my size it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my  inches perfectly with no real give so keep that in mind the top does seem a little blousey which i typically avoid  already but this was still super flattering overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it

i was urged to try this on by my usual stylist as she thought it would look nice with shorts i purchased or jeans or pencil skirt i own she knows a lot of what i own it is truly pretty love the embroidered cut outs makes the tank look stylish the cut is also flattering though i think ill have to wear a strapless bra color is also warm enough to work on pale skin like me or a golden tan i purchased the  regulr tried on petite but i found it was short and flared too much i am  lbs 
"the delicate print and coloring are stunning i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nicethis is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines"
it was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite  the proportion was off  i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it i think if you are very tall you might pull this off im  and even the extra small regular hung below my booty
this dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offeringso i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well i ordered in the  i am  about  it fits beautifullyeven though its a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the  it is no longer available though but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is
i really like this dress it does not bother me that it is not lined i feel very feminine wearing it i plan to get a shrug to wear with it
this dress is gorgeous it is better in person than online i love the detail of the pleats and the waist it is light weight and perfectly lines and a beautiful dress for twirling with a martini in hand in fact my sister tried to steal it from during a recent trip to europe it is that adorable and flattering  highly recommend
i love this tank top i was looking for a mockneck tank for a while and this totally fit the bill i wear it to work and out and feel great in it
i have been searching my entire marriage   years  for the perfect christmas and valentines day dress it had to be red it had to be the right red and it had to be my style there were several i saw over the years that were either too burgundy or too matronly when i saw this dress i knew my  search was over this is the most beautiful and elegant red specialoccasion dress i have ever seen i cannot wait to wear it for christmas i think retailer should have reordered thi
i purchased this dress in yellow in a size  and  since im between sizes and the  fits like a dream i love this dress its a nice length hitting just below my knees and i can pull off strappy sandals as well as wedge heels and it all looks great i also like that the top is situated so that i can wear a regular bra with it i was concerned that the pleats would look tacky in person but they give the dress a nice amount of movement and swing highly recommend
love this sweater i purchased both the green and gray versions and will wear them constantly this winter although some reviews were critical of the feel of the yarn i do not find this to be a problem so happy with these products for reference to size i bought the m and am  the sweater hits me exactly where it does on the model
this is a chunky boxy sweater it runs big the pictures dont really show how over sized the cowl neck is i love it and think it looks great with skinny jeans or leggings but the oversized shape might not work with every body type
this dress has a marilyn feel to it felt like a dream
these are a perfect staple piece you can dress them up or down and theyre insanely comfortable even if you hold a lot of your weight in your butt and thighs like i do i feel like these pants do such a nice job of being formfitting and flattering without squeezing the life out of you i have always loved any and all retailer pants in this style because they just fit so well and last a really long time i will continue to buy these for many many years
"the colors including the deep blue in the background are as vibrant and harmonious in person as you would hope it looks like an oil pastel drawing the print itself is very well done im so picky about the quality and resolution but even up close every part is beautiful the cut is great it doesnt show too much of the armpit the straps and sides cover a normal bra and the neckline just shows the collarbonesthe feel is very light and floaty some sites mislabel the material but t"
this layered top fits true to size the style is trendy and cute the type of fabric is nice i love the design of the back i would definitely recommend it its worth the money
this really was nothing special for  there are much cuter tops at retailer it wasnt particularly flattering as it was very boxy so it added volume it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big overall this was just a miss for me
these are cute comfy and just as pictured a soft greenishgray but i didnt find them to be super flattering on me or at least not slimming in my view im  about  lbs and got them in sm which fit just right but they do go all the way up to my true waist they are tube legs meaning theyre not contoured tights so theres excess fabric at the toe itd be all bunched in flats and theres a tiny bit of looseness at the ankle theres also no distinguishable front or back and no
it is a little boxy but its not unflattering in my opinion the sweatshirt material is soft the ruffles keep their shape and position and arent too overwhelming on my small frame i like the small slits on the sides they allow the sweater to drape nicely it also hit at a flattering spot a little below the hip   lbs and got the xxs petite this fit true to size for me
"dear retailer  designersjust want a nice dress that isnt made from polyester dont mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics but please enough of the polyester loveyour customers"
i dont know what the problem with this sweater was on me but it just didnt work it was too wide across the breastline i think creating a boxy shape that just didnt look flattering outside of that the sweater was lightweight and seemed well made i was sad to send it back especially at the sale price
this lightweight sweater arrived within a few days of ordering and was packaged well its fit is true to size and will be perfect for slightly cool days and evenings the navy blue color is accurately represented in the picture my only issue with this item is that one of the small lace panels at the hem on the hip is not sewn in all the way i will keep it since it was on sale but i need to decide whether to have it fixed or to just remove both of them as they are very small and dont add much
"these are the perfect light weight relaxing summer pantsthe fabric is soft and light and has some stretch so i think they can be worn more fitted way too i dont want to show off my bottom half of my body shape so these are perfect ones to be a bit loose to covers the silhouette but still looks feminine  not too loose im   lb and usually wear  jeans  petite gave me the perfect relaxed look without losing the feminine look i think  could fit as well but would sn"

this is so much better than wearing a grey sweatshirt i love it and it makes me feel pretty
i  write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share  normally about a true  and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large i tried this on in the store in a  and because of the stretch in it it fit my hourglass shape really well i have a melodies that pencil dress in a  that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special
i had high hopes after reading all of the reviews but as you can see the dress didnt live up to them i ordered a size  and maybe a  wouldve fit better but im not going to find out the sheer area on the model really stands out it does not in real life there were loose threads throughout and there really shouldnt be at this price point i was going to wear this to a wedding but as a member of the wedding party i dont think it would picture well at all im sorry that its headed
this is a very flattering dress that is perfect for those little black dress occasions two other people in my family own this dress and love it its now my turn to add it to my collection the dress is quite long for my  frame so i have reordered it in a petite size for a little better fit and length the lace is very detailed and the nude slip underneath keeps the lace from being too revealing very elegant a little chanel like and by the way the belt is included as another reviewer
i had really high hopes for this dress based on the reviews im on the curvier side but was surprised to find that my usual size  was very loose and long  the hem hit just below my knee instead of feeling sexy the weird fit just made me feel matronly im going to exchange for a  petite which will hopefully be a little more figurehugging and not as long despite my fit issues the design is stunning intricate and unusual im hoping that the new size will do it more justice
got this dress in the mail today and i am blown away the fit is amazing normally i would get an  in dresses sometimes a  i got a  in this one and its perfect hugs in all the right places everyone needs this dress i feel like with the style and fit of this dress it should be a little more snug so i recommend sizing down cannot wait to wear this one

"i am fortunate to work in an environment where i can wear jeans just about every day so i am always looking for a good pair to add to my collection i bought this style on a relatively quick shopping trip with not a lot of thought well  weeks later i was back buying a second pairthe color is great a little darker with that warn in look but no whiskering with a fit that is tts i like the higher waist to cover my mommytummy and my butt looks pretty fabulous but the best thing about th"
i so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed  ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail  just felt  looked frumpy  i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if wasnt a good fit for my body type  i wore my normal size  and it just didnt flatter  made me feel  years older

this sweater is light gray as shown in the photo not dark gray as the description states i went up from my usual size so would say it runs small it is lightweight enough that i think i will get adequate use out of it this winter in fl
"this dress is gorjuss i thought i would be in between a  but after trying on the  in the storeim a perfect  i was a little nervous about the price but then i said treat yoself and made the leap and didnt look back i felt so confident wearing this to a wedding and received so many compliments i wanted a dress that made me feel sexy without showing so much skinthis achieved it all make the purchaseyou wont regret it im   and the  was spot on"
this is a gorgeous sweater but huge and when i say huge i mean gigantic im usually a size large and i dont even think the small would be small enough the cowl neck and fabric overall is great although stretches out which is why it becomes so overwhelming but the sweater just hung on me like a short blanket the armholes are very big  deceiving on the model returning
lightweight soft cotton top and shorts i think its meant to be a beach coverup but im wearing it as a thin lightweight summer outfit on these hot hot days the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didnt realize when i ordered it but i like it and it matches the look in the photos and the shorts are very lowcut  dont expect them up around your waist again i like that some might want to wear a cami underneath because its a thin cotton but im fine asis i bought it i
i think this dress is beautiful i ordered it for my brothers wedding but the nude slip underneath made the dress look a bit too revealing i may keep it for a holiday party though because it really is gorgeous and super flattering it dies run large typically im a  and the  fit perfectly
i tried this dress on in store and i realized it is true to size in every way i am  and needed a petite for it to land just above my knee this dress was elegant i wore it to a wedding and some thought it was a rent the runway dress ha im way to classy for that for all you ladies who want to look sophisticated in those cooler evening events this is your dress i felt so elegant and danced the night away and had no issues the clasps go all the way down the dress so i do suggest li

bought this in my usual size small and it fits well i wear it around the house constantly to stay warm this winter it is so very warm and comfortable very easy to wear could be worn out but i prefer it with lounge pants due to the comfort and warmth it provides it is a nice neutral and can be worn with many other retailer casual clothes highly recommend
i typically wear a medium but went with a large because i am pregnant and tall i think i could have used the medium in width but like the length of the large it is a wider fit and is significantly shorter in the front than the back but i think works with the look of the top i think you could dress it up or down and the fabric is cozy i would highlight that it has a wider fit but i think that is the design of the top overall i am pleased and i think meets my search for an off the should

if youre expecting a sweatshirt when you order this you might be disappointed its actually more like a banded tshirt which i dont mind im  and the length comes just below the button on my jeans perfect length for us shorter gals sleeves are quite long on me but i like to wear them pushed up anyways and they actually stay up i wouldnt pay full price for this but its a nice top at the sale price cute with destroyed jeans or black leggings
this sweater is a hit the color is fantastic and the shoulder cutouts add a feminine and unique touch looks amazing paired with booties a statement necklace and jeans definitely affordable too highly recommend

i loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly it makes me look like a football player i am   build and i was swimming in the m i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads it hangs and gaps awkwardly the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short
"these are beautiful pants the wine color is rich and they are very soft they just run really small i normally wear a  regular but often i have to roll the length up a bit so this time i ordered a  thinking it would be the same just shorter  but i could hardly even pull them over my slinder size  foot i am going to exchange them for a  regular i so hope that they fit  they are so lovelyi totally recommend  just order a size or maybe two up though to be fair maybe peti"
color fabric blend and pattern are even more beautiful in person unfortunately i wont be keeping this due to length i am only  and this top dropped only to about  inches below my navel if you have a short torso or like the short look i would recommend this
i recommend this product if you are tall the pants fit great but they are too long im  and they drag on the ground
i have other pilcro cord leggings  the black ponte knit leggings in my usual size  in this brand they fit well  have a nice stretch  very comfy i ordered these velvet leggings in the  the blue  the wine  they just dont fit the same as the others these are a little short in the crotch area  the legs feel restrictive  not much give i have skinny legs length is perfect though at the ankle these same exact pants were just in at the store in black  fit a little better but i don
these run at least  sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand mother such a bummer because the quality is totally on point im going to exchange them for a huge size i guess whatever i dont mind having a size thats so much larger than all my other jeans i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control its not retailers fault so annoyed

these corduroys are comfortable and fit true to size i am just over  feet tall  lbs with long legs for my height and the  fits really well they wash and dry well with minimal if any shrinkage as long as you use low temperatures i gave them  stars instead of  because i feel the material could be more substantial than it is the green is actually a very attractive mossy brown
cute casual dress  i especially love the thick fabric as i think it will hold up well the fit is slightly boxy but its short enough for it not to matter as much and the waist tie helps give the dress a little shape i was surprised that the the petite xs was off for me proportionally usually i wear petite sizing at retailer but the regular xs fit much better
i love this top it gives a little bit of a sleeveless look yet is more flattering on the arms for those who dont normally wear sleeveless tops i think it runs very large  im normally a size sm and the extra small was right its loose around the waist yet has a feminine fitthe tiny balls around the neck button at the back flutter sleeves and linen fabric are all cute details that make this top unique i also like how the fluttering goes down the sides and not just around the sleeve
this top is beautiful and the color yellow is gorgeous i highly recommend
these pants are so soft and stretchy they feel like leggings i love the ankle length as they are perfect to wear with both flats and booties i am  with fairly long legs and these hit right at my ankle they are so comfortable i have ordered in the green red and gray my go to pants this winter
the fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look i have a large chest but the similarly cut blouse without the textured fabric  from the same designer fit me fine this one is just cut differently i even tried sizing up and down  to no avail the photo on the model seems misleading because i dont see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone  even with a smaller chest i was so
i really like the idea behind this top but at least for me the execution wasnt quite there i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace when it gapsyou move you can see a lot if you dont move the front panel is pretty opaque which is good i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i dont feel comfortable with the sheerness so i returned it i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked

these pilcro jeans are so very cute i usually wait for a sale to purchase the pilco jeans but i didnt want to chance them not being available in my size the pilco jeans seems to sell out fast the cotton material is very soft but not sloppy you will love the embroidery down the side of the leg they do run a bit big i purchased them in one size smaller for a slimmer fit i would suggest one size up if you like them more baggy
this is really cute sweater soft cozy around the chest bit small went up size but the shape looked the same im keep it because of softness warmth and versatile i got it in black would recommend it or at least try it for yourself
i tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe i did not like the fit of the fish print but the stripe is perfectso try more than one color if you are interested in this style also try more than one size of course i almost always order up in a swimsuit and this time was no different the medium fit great although i am a xss according to the size guide i am a  for reference but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide i do not like to feel constricted but i still want the top to

this top is well made and the pleats give it a whimsical feel im still debating on keeping it as its slight boxy
this is a soft light sweater that will take you through fall i got the raspberry which seems more like a cinnamon color to me the design is really cute with the fabric inset in the back i got three of these in different colors so obviously i really like them for layering and can recommend them it seems tts i am  and  lbs medium is perfect
not only was it love at first sight when i saw it online but i fell even more in love at first touch everything about this dress is perfection i got the black motif  the colors are just lovely the weight  feel of the dress are nice  the length is great i added a skinny black belt for more waist definition but its cute with or without it i am more than pleased with this purchase
this romper is so flattering i normally dont like how short rompers are but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me not to mention that its super comfortable i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements very happy i bought it i normally wear a medium but the small fit me perfectlyid recommend sizing down
i really wanted to love this dress but even though i got a small it was still too big i also dont think the horizontal pattern was a good look for me other than that it is beautiful and the fabric felt nice
this is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust  even in a larger size than i normally wear it is also very very short in the body i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though
such a fun and beautiful skirt absolutely love the cut and the way it flows when walking  it is very very bright in my opinion and not so much my style so i will be wearing it sparingly got a ton of compliments the first time wearing it
ive been wanting to try on this dress since it popped up online we visited san francisco this weekend  i finally got my chance it fit great  was flattering i am currently pregnant  it worked with my growing belly but will also look good when i do not have a belly i would definitely recommend 
so this skirt is everything the only downside is that its not in a petite sizing so im going to have to get this altered im  the sizing is appropriate usually wear an  or  in pants and got a size medium for the skirt the material is thick enough for spring or summer weather the color is just right not too light the pockets are adorable and i feel like im channeling some  realness sits higher on your waist and is super comfortable i know im going to get a lot of use o
absolutely beautiful and well made this pair of jeans is perfect no flaws whatsoever i usually wear size  but bought the  as it fits better  is very slightly loose but i think it supposed to be like that for a boyfriend jeans i prefer it nice and fitted so  works better im lucky to find them still available in the store while its not online i didnt hesitate to buy at full price which i rarely did im so in love with my new purchase very happy
i think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste i am tall slimathletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size they have some give and tend to get looser while you wear them but because they are midrise they wont slide down they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me the demin is solid the color a nice medium dark sky blue the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up
i was doubtful when i first tried this on the holding horses brand tends to not quite fit me very well more so in dresses than tops also it looks cute but not great on the hanger this a musttryon dress its just flowy enough to not look sloppy or maternity but also feel easy to wear the print and cut are flattering it has pockets also the length is nice close to knee length the fabric is good quality doesnt wrinkle easily im surprised how quickly i fell in love with this dr
"wellthis is on me as i saw this hanging in the store but way off on my size which is xxs petitei looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for meboth pieces are transparent  no opaque lining at all is inside both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials there is no flow just cling the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shapethis may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece  at all bes"
i love everything about this tee it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees the fabric is soft and the tee is very comfortable i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors i actually love both colors the red is a nice slightly brownish red i wore that color with a pair of plaid white teal  taupe shorts and i got compliments on my outfit the color will go with more than one might think i havent worn the green one yet i hope this tee comes bac
"this dress is quite lovely but there are a few things to knowthe blue color is much more of a dark teal with more of a dull green tinge than i expected still pretty but definitely not a pure blue i loved the look of the blue online but i think the pink might have worked a little better with my coloringthe dress is a bit low in front not inappropriately low but if you are hoping to be able to adjust by pulling the shoulders back a bit or something be aware that the bodice drapi"
this top was fun casual with flair it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost but i would just wear a bra of the same color and dont think anyone would notice  i didnt buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee in my opinion

i tried on the regular size at my store and it was too long for me te sleeves were enourmous and the dress fell midcalf but i love the feel of hte mateiral and if it were to fit properly is very falttering i will order the petite size later on to try i liked it enough for that the blue is a nice teal color double layer and extremely comfortable the finish is laser cut no stichting
beautiful color bought a small i am  and  pounds the length is the only thing that is usually a problem on size small for me however the chest area was extremely tight and ill fitting i thought i am only a  im returning it i did think it was pricey for what you get as well the color was by far the best thing about this dress it could have been better quality and fit
i love everything about this dress beautiful vibrant color and fabric i got the sp which is a perfect length for me to wear with the jasper  jeera nijar sandles it is very flowy and full but i love that about it happy i was able to snag a petite size but i think the regular would have been ok i could have gotten away with an xs but the small fits great
i love love this top its the perfect peplum tee i would get more if this was offered in more color combos the stripes add a cute effect to the tee and its a perfect soft cotton cant say enough about this one
wish this site had ask a question about the product feature like amazon does just wondering if anyone has seen this product in person to verify color it looks orange but descriptor says red would appreciate feedback thank you for your help
this sweater is a nice weight and may run a little on the large size the orange is a nice tonemore on the blue side which suits my coloring more than a more yelloworange it is bright i think it will look great over black top and slacks or light color top and jeans nice weight for fall a bit on the stretchy side so i hope it wont stretch too much out of shape
"this is a beautiful dress the color is really great and i love the cut  flattering around the neckline and loose and flowy the one downside is that it is pretty long i am  and usually somewhere between and xs and s for dresses so went with the xs the size is great but its just a tad long for wearing with flats i actually think if i was bustier the length would be fine but since im pretty flat theres nothing to fill the dress i wish i had been able to snag a petite but they w"
i do not see this as frumpy if you wear it with heels i think the bodice is very flattering
i have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans sadly i dont think these are it i love the design and style of these jeans great length great cut great color unfortunately in the  weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like ive had them for  years im so disappointed and will have to continue on my search apparently they dont make jeans like they used too
i got the sweater in red id call it more orange its a bit of a baggy fit not tight which i love i feel like this will be a perfect cover up for cool summer evenings i got a medium i go between small and medium and i love the fit i could have gotten a small but i liked it looser the buttons are special too
"this is my third dress by this designer i love his work this will be the most versatile and classic of the threei love how wearing his dresses makes me feel my best and comfortable unique and well made"
love this dress im   lbs i ordered  the dress is stretchy at all the right places and accentuates your curves its very wellmade i usually like loose fitting clothes but i feel this dress needs to be snug but not tight i tried  and it was just a bit loose this dress is wellworth the price
simply put this dress will make you feel like joan from mad men in all the best ways amazingly formfitting and impeccably constructed like you imagine clothes used to be its true there are hook  eye closures between each button from about the waist up yes they are a bit tedious but theyre essential to the flawless gapless fit of this buttonup style im   and got the  based on reading every single review posted its a tinge tight but im very happy with it and the
i love the colors and saw the xxs p in a store so tried it on but sadly that was still a lot of fabric on me i think if you have very small thin arms that may work but with muscles it just made me look bigger than i am the design pattern is really nice though  lbs  dd flat
ive been looking for the right swing dress for a long time and this one is perfect one of my favorite features is the design at the hem of the dress it looks even better in person the material is a thicker almost canvasy type of fabric which i love because it makes the dress feel higher quality to me i love how comfortable the dress is and its so easy to throw it on and look amazing i tried on two sizes at two different stores and received compliments from staff and customers both ti
i have been on the search for a perfect lbd for years and have wasted money on dresses that i had to settle for but when i saw this dress i knew it was love at first sight the things i love about this dress the built in shaperslip holds your junk in place the lace detailing is perfect in all the right places and the button and hook  eye makes you feel secure great dress that you will love
i had been looking at this dress online hoping for a popback and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size i found the colors and print a bit blah i felt like it could use a little detail for the pricebead detail or embroidery in real life and i didnt love the fabric in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesnt drape particularly well things got worse in the dressing roomit was a disaster on me im busty and while the top fit because
the moment i saw this i knew i had to try it on its a definite power dress  made me feel like marvels agent carter i could take over the world in this dress planning to wear it to work more casually and as my holiday party dress its easy to dress up or down and is incredibly comfortable
saw this on line and bought right away perfect romper for summer color is great and fabric is soft like all cloth and stone chambray it fits pretty true to size maybe a little small when putting on but i think it will stretch out a little i didnt want it baggy fits great through hips and booty looks good i will wear with flip flops sandals or wedge i also got  off which made deal even better
i wanted to love this dress the material is beautiful but sadly i agree with other reviewer the model definitely has this pinned back i am on the small side   lbs straight figure very tiny girls and this dress looked awful totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great xs ordered and length was good but wish the swin
when i saw this dress online  it was a must have i preordered immediately and had my fingers crossed that id get it thankfully it did this dress has blown me away it exceeds all expectations i ordered an xl which is a normal size for me and im glad i did the body is very swingy but the top is true to size the print is magical whimsical bold  bohemian and transitional into every single season i am  and the dress hits just above my knees i feel gorgeous in it the woven cotton
this is an amazing dress it did stretch out a little so although i got the large i probably couldve gotten the medium beautiful feel fully lined on the really hot days this is what i grab and i stay cool all day i get so many compliments on this dress the colors are gorgeous
material cheap too small good idea for design love princess cut but bad material good idea though sending back

"this dress is magical i wore it to a christmas party and felt like the belle of the ball my dress swirled around me as i spun on the dance floor later i spilled a tequilaginger all over the front i was devastated but it almost instantly dried and there are no stains you cant even tell i spilled it is handwashable which is great as well i am  and  the xxsp fit like a glovehighly recommend any other dress would have been ruined but this one was literally magical"
this dress is beautiful  the pictures do not do it justice i love the fabric and overall feel of the dress  light and airy i have very broad shoulders and i did not feel like it look good on me so i am sending it back too bad for me i think the dress is perfect for weddings parties and even everyday wear

"while it hasnt been cold enough to wear this out i really like this sweater i love the pattern with the uneven hem and stripes or bands its also super soft and cozy feeling it does run a little big and while that is part of the aesthetic i do wish it was a drop smaller i ordered my normal top size medium and its a little biglooser which i dont mind except for the long sleeves if you like things with a tighter fit i might order a size downthough its cashmere it still seems"
this top is really pretty  i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it the only complaint is that the front is very sheer you have to wear an under shirt of some kind
"this dress is gorgeous the store only had a size  so i am waiting for my size  to arrive very pretty navy color super cute love all the embroidery detail my niece is getting married in june and i cant wait to wear iti normally wear a  or  judging by the fit i think the  will be perfect"
this is a really unique jacket the suedelike darker fabric is so soft and brings great character to the jacket i love the neutral color and the fit is true to size the only minor complaint i have is that the band at the bottom of the jacket flares out a little making it wider and a little odd looking but i have learned to ignore this because all of the other features are so awesome would recommend
this is a beautiful dress the quality is excellent the  layers and the embroidery are beautiful however it just didnt look right on me it looked like a maternity dress i am very petite short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust unfortunately i will be returning this dress
"ordered this online in a petite  im  fits very nicely but for the amount of fabric this dress has  layers total i think a  will be a better choice and not look as full maybe a little more fitted which will be more attractive at the top on mehowever the detailing on the dress is really beautiful and high quality the dress has quite a bit of weight to it with the top swingy layer a tulle like layer for shape and then the sheath like slip the colors are all very dark"
this jacket has been a fun addition to my wardrobe it has a very cute fit and i like that it pulls in a bit at the sides to give it a form fitted look best of all it stretches well despite the form fit you can cross your arms or raise them up and you dont feel like your movement is restricted i really like the soft suedelike material on the inside of the arms and the sides of the jacket it fits true to size can be worn casual or dressed up a bit highly recommend

this is such a cute jumper i bought it to wear to a beach wedding i took a chance trying on a medium im a true large and was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit very excited to add this to my springsummer repertoire

i originally ordered this top in the black and its been on back order for a month i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did  the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade  pattern the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fallwinter i highly recommend this top for all body types
i just bought this dress on the half off sale price which is practically a steal and i must say i absolutely adore it it runs pretty tts but all they had available was one size up from my usual  so i bought the  and it fits just fine  the color is beautiful and the look of the dress is very vintage  and so cute i didnt find the sleeves to stick out at all on me so maybe i just got lucky and the print is just adorable on this i highly recommend
i am loving these new leggings and i dont even surf i just wear them to the gym and at home and to run errands with a cute tunic top etc they make me feel sunny and happy  fabric is light and flexible but stays in place went running in them size is accurate i am usually a  on retailer pantsskirts  on jeans and the small was perfect
tried it on at the store must of been a return at first i wasnt thrilled with this dress have a little bit of a pouch and would never think i could wear a tight dress like this the cut was perfect for that imperfect belly went to a  hour dinner that night and was so comfortable not itchy and i felt very pretty in it husband loved it and was happy for me to show my curves again would not of ordered this online so glad it was in store much more vibrant in person  try it you will lik
i am not a fan of sweater dresses and did not pay attention to this one when looking at it online however it immediately caught my attention in a store i decided to put it on and the dress looked amazing soft warm skin hugging material long skinny sleeves and more importantly i looked amazing in this dressi think colors are more vibrant design is more lively in person than in picture i am   so i loved that intricate dress pattern broken lines in front made me not look li
lightweight soft cotton top and shorts i think its meant to be a beach coverup but im wearing it as a thin lightweight summer outfit on these hot hot days the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didnt realize when i ordered it but i like it and it matches the look in the photos and the shorts are very lowcut  dont expect them up around your waist again i like that some might want to wear a cami underneath because its a thin cotton but im fine asis i bought it i
love the fit and feel of these and super stylish too i want in more colors if i can get it
ive been looking for the right leggings that are of good quality thick enough to feel appropriately covered and a good price point  these are those leggings need more
"i am torn about this top on the one hand it is beautiful in all aspectsflattering cutbeautiful detail at neck victorian necklineivory color flattering on most skin tones including my very pale skinspeck of gold in fabric it is lines with gold threadbummers it is seethrough as in you can see through the neck part the picture online shows a more covered look i think the model ash a shirt underneath on me you really see the skin through so i will have to try with a nude b"
im  with a dd bust and this top in a medium doesnt even hit at my hip im not sure why so many of these tops are being made so short i just purchased another peasant lace top that has the same problem it ends up being very boxy looking adding a few inches in length would have made this top perfection debating about ordering a large just to add length but otherwise the tops fits everywhere else  its so pretty though the lace detail and the nude panel are so delicate and the mater
great pair of black pants a step up from basic leggings nice weight and a little ribbed detail on the sides would recommend
this is the little black dress ive been looking for for years  great slim fit runs small  i usually get sized out but the  was a snug fit eyecatching design like the other reviewer i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier but overall a chic dress
this top is beautiful online and in person i am in no way a large full figured gal but i did order an xl reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size this shirt is horribly tiny in person the xl regular fit looked like an xs have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what will take back other than fit the shirt is very beautiful in every way
they are a perfect thickness fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office outside pant got them in the grey am thrilled w the texture i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts not see through either would definitely recommend them
all the colors are beautiful the white is a true white i got the gray one it runs large so i would recommend sizing down unless you plan on layering using thicker fabrics underneath
for an athro top this is a good price point especially for such a beautiful piece its really just a basic tee but the lace insets bring it up several notches and its much prettier than the picture shows i think it fits very true to size  im normally a size small and got that size with this   lbs   although the lace is very sheer i really couldnt see my nude bra through it so dont feel ill need a cami because that would ruin the delicate design of this

i think this is the first peasant top ive found that doesnt fit like a tent i did size down to a small although im normally between small and medium i even found that the shape of this top is quite flattering maybe the darker embroidery helps im very happy with this purchase
i bought this top for my mom for christmas i wasnt sure if she would like it but it is really nice in person and she loved it it fit true to size and can be dressed down as it is on the model or dressed up i am so glad i decided to get this top highly recommend
i love this shirt wore it today and got many compliments i bought the mauve looks lilac to me its very comfy and long its got a lovely swing feel which is great for covering my baby belly
the colors in this dress are beautiful the greenblue version but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy i purchased it online and wasnt expecting it to be so sheer  the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown i really wanted to love it but its going back
ive been shopping with retailer over  years and this is my first review i almost didnt order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies im   and these jeans are perfection they look amazing with a  inch heel i dont think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway love these
i ordered this in a medium and although the detailsdesign of the shirt were cute the swing did not work for me this time around i typically like looser fitting tops but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent
i ordered this dress online in  p in the orange color the length was perfect but the dress seemed big it was a lot of dress so i went into the store and tried on a regular  but the dress was a little long they  have petite in stock so they had it shipped to me and it fit perfectly i am  and  pounds i  think this dress would work if you have a big bust  a  so it fits nicely around the chest area the length of the dress was also perfect
classy tunic can be worn with jeans or leggings neckline is small but stretches so it goes on easily color is perfect for spring my only word of cautionthe design can add a bit of bulk around the middle so probably not your best bet if you are tummy conscious
i absolutely love this jacket its one of the best things ive bought this season the interior is so unbelievably soft i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin the fit is beautiful as is the pattern its even better in person than in the photo it is pricey but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it its well worth it
i tried hard to make this work because it is beautiful but ended up returning it first it is very delicate material  i was terrified trying it on second i just couldnt make the drawstring work for me to achieve the fit i wanted third it was too low for me and would need a cami over the slip while i didnt think the colors were as deep as the picture it was still pretty i could have possibly gone down a size to fix some of my concerns but then i know it would have been too short for
in the fall i purchased every single color of the left of center swing top long sleeve great colors and very easy to wear when i saw these i swooned these are very similar knit to the left of center but the swing is bigger and the linen insets on the side make this easy top even more beautiful these run true to sizebasically you are only fitting your arms and chest this top will definitely has a little give with wear which will just add to the shape and effortlessness the linen ins
i was looking for a new springsummer tee that still gave coverage for chillier mornings and nights and this is it it has a nice swing to it that isnt too wide think a flattering aline cut that has some movement towards the bottom hem it is fitted and flattering where it needs to be the shoulders and ribcage run fitted and tts which means you dont get lost in the top its not boxy or oversized but if you want a fitted and more flattering look you can definitely size down easily parti
highly recommend these jeans they are ultrasoft and fit your body like a dream the wash is flattering on them as well i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size
this is a really cute skirt and it seems wellmade good stitchwork and enough weight to the fabric that im not worried about underwear showthrough but not too heavy for a summer skirt i sized up from an  to a  because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum also the zipper doesnt lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the sidestill looks great imo i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt color is true to
hi  i bought these in moss for both of my daughters they love them the material is substantial and washes beautifully the fit is straight up and down and is not forgiving on figure flaws i would recommend this to a thin figured girl
i read the reviews before i bought this sweater online one person did mention that the side slits were cut very high but i had no idea when i tried the xs on at home i was quite surprised by just how high up those side slits were with just a pair of jeans you could see flesh at first i thought it maybe wouldnt work but i decided to keep it because everything else about the sweater is lovely ill be layering this with a tank underneath its a bit quirky and funky and that appeals to me
this is such a pretty top i do not feel it runs big as another review mentioned to fit the sleeves comfortably i do not have large arms at all i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model a bit more of a tunic fit on me it is really a pretty top either way the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do
these are literally the most comfortable and the softest jeans i have ever owned i just got them a few weeks ago and im already obsessed with them they have the perfect amount of stretch that makes them flattering and comfortable but they dont stretch out like all my other jeans do i ordered my usual size  and they fit great cant recommend these enough
i tell everyone i know to try these jeans that they are so worth the price tag ive been an ag super fan for years but i fell in love with paige the moment i tried these on i still love ag for their colored and patterned ankle denim and cords i have worn these over  times without ever having to wash them i never understood the idea that youre not supposed to wash denim but now i realize that its feasible they dont stretch out and still hug me like a second skin  without feeling
this top does look better online and one reviewer said it also looks good inperson but runs small i usually wear xl in some cases l i tried l it was small so i sent it back for xl the xl fit perfectly at the top but was tight at the bottom the bottom pulled at the seams so i am sending it back the embroidery itself is very pretty it is a nice dressy top that can be worn with multiple colored pants or leggings it just didnt fit me at the bottom i think it would work better for a lea
i think its a little on the long side and the sleeves are a little tight but otherwise i really like this jacket its lightweight for summer and yet more stylish than the other long sleeve things i grab in case i get cold
this jacket is stylish and unique love the lines and the fit is very flatteringcoral is a bit more orangedk peach than what i think of as typical coral fun color for spring i sized up from my typical s to m
super soft and stylish its a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets love it i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small im  and  typically wear a size s but sometimes have to size up to a m i got a s fits great not too tight sleeves are plenty long enough i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work aka grad school and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings but its not too bulky so i can keep it on
"i ordered the xxs i think retailer has gone on the bigger size again and i went from small to xs to xxs so true to size in that sense i love the color nude and it is pretty soft and comfortable the cut is flattering the cowl neck is pretty the sleeves are shorter and the hem is wider aka swing this would look totally adorable with my flare or wide leg jeans i think ti would look nice too with skinnies if you have leaner legsfor reference   in waist  lbs"

this top is gorgeous in person im in love with it its perfect for the holiday season it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit
this tank is wonderful for those with full hips because it hangs just right to cover any flaws the colors are bright and the material is soft there is a band at the end that elevates the tank so you can wear it out if you would like not too low in the front and overall the tank runs true to size i suppose if you wanted a tighter fit you could size down  size but i like the way it hangs in my regular size im very busty and hippy and this top makes both look slim highly recommend
"im   lbs purchased smalljacket fits well and is not too heavy didnt feel tight in the arms great to wear on a cool spring day i bought the white and grey jacket"
this caught my eye in the store last week and i decided to try it on its the perfect lightweight jacket the photos here show it as activewear but i think the details on it allow it to be much more versatile its very flattering and i found it to run true to size
im all over this trend but this vest is quite thickpoufy and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball i love it  but i think you need some height for this to look its best on me a sweater vest would perhaps be better i am chesty but i cant decide its really cute if youre taller than  dont hesitate

im an xl in all retailer tops and sometimes the xl are still too small to fit loosely i dont like to wear tight clothes having said that i had to purchase this top in a size small because it was just cut so large the sleeves hang a bit odd if you dont get the correct size i love the feel of the blouse the fabric is a nice quality i recommend giving it a try but have patience during the process of figuring out the size that will look best on you in this blouse

i love the color and the design of this pantlooks very bohemian it runs large and it has sort of a short inside of it that is made of a silky polyesterso its not as loose on the inside as you would think this short is not a bad thingbut its something that is good to know i love them and will definitely be wearing them very soon
im   lbs and tried this on a small at my store and then ordered it in a small petite i like the petite better even though there isnt much of a difference the petite is about  inches long it still covers the bum but i was hoping to wear it with shorts and i think its too long for that i love the beautiful coral color received a compliment on the color the first time i wore it the quality is superb the only downside is i dont like the way it looks when zipped it doesnt give mu
very nice top like the linen fabric i ordered my regular size m and its huge makes me look larger than i am and i will be returning it i would like a size s i think just not a flattering oversize fit for me
im glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual mediumlarge since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it i adore the color pattern slim profile and cut in arm holes wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated
just received this in the mail and i love it the fit is wide and flowy but i wouldnt say it runs large i dont think i could have sized down in the shoulders perfect easy breezy fall top cannot wait to wear it
i think this blouse looks better in real life than it does on line and im glad i decided to try it on i bought an extra small in the red which i think is the best color the white looks like a nightgown too bad there were not more darker fall prints because i would have bought more than one i think this style would look best on someone that is tall and thin a petite person might get away with turning it into a dress i would buy a longer version of this  as it is it is a fun feminine casu

this top looks adorable in the product photos so i had high hopes i think i might be too short to pull it off but like another reviewer said i found it to be like a tent on me billowing out in all directions it was just overall too big on mei even considered whether i could wear it as a dress but the sleeves were also too billowy on me i am   lbs and tried the xs
love this top purchased for family photos and i think its great personally i dont think the model shot is doing it justice  its much prettier in person runs true to size for retailer i am a  and i purchased a small

i am petite  and i ordered the xxsp i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinnyslim pants or leggings i do not think it runs that large it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model i got the gray print and it is quite pretty

i love the idea of this top and ordered it in white it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made then it would have been a winner
i love this tunic purchased the dark orange in medium i am  and  lbs tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad so went with the medium and glad i did  this top should be comfortable feels very fall and perfect for casual gettogethers and running around town only comment is that it is rayon and for me anyway rayon doesnt wash too well  so we shall see how this one fairs
i think ill get a lot of wear out of this you will be able to size down  it will still hide a host of sins its very comfortable and stylish
i feel so lucky to have caught this as a popbackthis dress is killer its casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan its body skimming but lined so it doesnt cling to flaws the knit itself is substantial and its a mockneck not a turtleneck i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large because of weight and lining this is a spring and early fall dress
this definitely works for you  think fabric great quality and im  weeks and i think ill be able to use this to the end got my normalish size would never have kept this if i wasnt pregnant cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy or maybe go down two sizes if not this is not my first baby either love for my pregnancy

love this maxi gorgeous print flowy and romantic in my opinion runs a bit tight in the chest i sized up from my usual  to an  and it was perfect i am  and it was floor length without tripping me up looks great on darker skin i am on the fair side winter skin and the beige color down the middle looked fleshtoned and washed me out a bit but with a tan this dress will be perfect
this piece didnt make sense to me  maybe its bc im a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer  i didnt think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear  it went back
i visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics i love browsing the retailer store its a feast for my sensesthe pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in personall three feel different due to their color and pattern to me the burned orange feels like country and fall the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer they all look very cute oni did size down and still got the oversize flowing lookthis
i purchased this dress in white and i love the color i think its a great casual look and its really fun to wear my experience has been that this runs true to size im   lbs and i ordered a size xs
"i love this poncho it is flattering who would have thought i would use that word in the same sentence as a poncho and offers enough room for warm clothes underneathit is stiffer and thicker than i had originally anticipated and the material is somewhat itchy so i would recommend long sleeves and clothes with more covering underneath"
i saw this dress and i thought it would be perfect for that night that you dont feel like wearing just jeans yet you dont want to be overdressed the dress is  cotton and is extremely comfortable i paired with an open toe wide heeled bootie and a long necklace the dress has a slight a line bottom but fits close to the body in chest and arms extremely flattering for all body types and the color is a pretty blue a dress for all seasons
doesnt fit as tightas slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight
i love ag jeans i own several pair and i think they wash well and wear well that being said id never purchased a pair of the stevie cut before they have the same quality one would expect from ag and i like that the ankles arent true skinny jeans but have a little width its more ontrend for this season for me the issue was more with the color i order pink when they arrived they were beautiful in the little plastic bag my heart skipped a beat hooray cute new jeans except w
yes it runs a little large  i usually get a s or m in tops but for this i bought a s i am   lbs and i did not get the petite i feel like the regular hits me at the same area as the model in picture i went into retailer looking for a dress and walked out with this vest too  had to have versatile stylish pockets good quality
i bought these about a month ago in the sky blue  gorgeous color i was a little disappointed because they fit bigger than i normally wear my pants but i decided to keep them anyway they are the most comfortable pants ive ever worn  butter soft i have dressed them up with a nice top and suede booties and also worn casual with a baggy sweater and toms i highly recommend these pants
found this randomly in the store online return and didnt expect to like it but tried it on and fell in love with it extremely comfortable dress but also has a uniquespecial design that makes you feel great wearing it will be perfect to wear out when dont want to look too dressed up or like trying too hard
i love how the white and beige were not see through and actually very forgiving to people with cellulite love love the fit highly recommend im always a  but in these i even fit into the  i would say if youre in between size down i love the fit so much that i got the beige and white highly recommend hit at my ankle for me at

im super happy with this dress its extremely well made very light and comfortable and the shoulder cutouts are tastefully done this dress is cotton but doesnt look cheap or too casual its one of those rare finds that will look great dressed up or down this will absolutely work across seasons with leggings and bootsbooties or bare legs and sandals when spring comes around i do feel like it runs a little large but again its  cotton so i know there will be some shrinking when wash
i am  and weigh around  and the medium fit me perfectly hit me just below the knee cap its cottonlinen but not as prone to wrinkles as i thought it would be its double lined made from a quality fabric thicker but still very much breathable will see how this holds up in kansas citys  degree summers but so far  its been just fine id definitely recommend this skirt the only thing that this skirt is missing is pockets
i bought this dress because i love the cutout shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that id feel comfortable wearing the dress fits well and the shoulder cutout gives it a trendy look i love the classic navy color i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material  which ive always thought to be a cheaper thin cotton the slub is more substantial than other slub tops ive seen elsewhere so i was happy about that still it is made with slub
i have been looking for a cold shoulder dress for a while but havent been able to find anything i really liked i ordered this and picked it up at the local store it is very comfortable and seemed a little big at first so i washed and dried it and it seemed to shrink just a little to fit well i love the open shoulders i wore it with gray tights and gray boots for valentines day and it was perfect for the cold winter weather i think it is a bit overpriced but i still love it its a nice
i purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design not too fancy but definitely not casual either easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions the fit is great but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly it truly is fine though has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel very comfortable for an evening out

i was excited to find this on sale because i just love baily  their designs are always simple beautiful and comfortable and this one just like the other  baily  dresses i own is perfect i am   pounds and  bra size and got my usual size xs unlike my other baily  dresses this one has a more relaxed fit up top and then has a form fitting layer that shows off your curves on the bottom i personally dont think its too short but then again plan to wear tights with this pi
this dress is such a crazy beautiful color the picture doesnt do it justice i ordered this right when i saw it and i almost love it the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice but i just didnt find it flattering at all the slip wasnt the nicest but completely not a deal breaker i didnt think it was overly flattering on the model either so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway but something about the way its cut is just a little off for me it was very tru
i try to find something to like about everything i buy even if it turns out to be a disappointment for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt but unfortunately it was not enough this shirt is super boxy and runs large i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons wont pull at the ch
this dress looks great onfeminine and swishy color is bright and the underslip is nicely attached which i appreciateno fighting with straps etc i ordered a six for my   lb  self and it fits like a dream the extra  lbs i support with lots of food is on my tummy just to give you an idea of my shape
not what i was expecting but pleasantly surprised  was envisioning a more structuredtailored trouser but these are closer to leggings albeit very substantial ones with real pant touches like a zipbutton front and faux pockets  theyre form fitting soft yet supportive stretchy incredibly comfortable and tts  im a pretty legit  in pants  and the  near perfect with the rise coming right to my belly button  think ill grab another pair now while theyre available
"nice soft jeans cute style and i wish i could keep themthey just are too small on me  not sure if ive gained weight which i dont think i have because i had on a size  pair of pants today but i ordered a size  in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist i would honestly need a  or  looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt ill be able to get the size i need if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they dont fit my body type"

this top is lovely but fits like a crop top  and im very shortwaisted i wore it with highwaisted jeans and was tugging at it all day i think it will probably work better with a skirt the colors are beautiful it has a nice retro vibe recommended if you dont mind the crop factor

i think when this is new it runs big and then shrinks to the right size thats what it did for me anyway it did shrink after one wash but not significantly i bought it in m and feel it stayed within that range super cute with shorts  airy light love the white ordering another color

bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes had little to no shape to it some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for i feel like being short i just looked kind of dumpy on me fabric is nice but borders on see through it was just oknothing exciting

love the way this looked onlineon model would not recommend for a shorter or curvy person such as myself it just ended up looking like a very chic potato sack on me and was not flattering
these jeans fit perfectly however the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic
material is nice design would be so great if it didnt fit so large i am   athletic build the dress could be belted i think a very slim girl at retailer did this but it is not worth  in my opinion if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it however it is not flowy it fits okay in the shoulders almost too loose and the rest looks like a potato sack so disappointed

this jumpsuit is fabulous in person it is elegant and easy and very figure flattering i have a very curvy shape but a  ddd bust so i would say i am a top heavy hourglass this jumpsuit does me right the only thing i would say is i dont think it would be very comfortable on a person with a long torso i am  and bought this in  regular and the length is perfect with heels but the whole top half fits me perfectly but shows alot of boob if im not careful but i dont think it would be s

you know how you hope that a dress that you order online is as good as you think it will be well this one is better then i had hoped it fits beautifully it is crafted beautifully there is nothing i dont like about it i was pleasantly surprised at how light the fabric is i thought it might be a heavier denim but it is perfect not so light that you can see through it but cool and breezy even in the florida heat do yourself a favor and grab this one before its gone
paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit these jeans are the best new addition to your collection the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out they do come extremely long so they will most likely need to be hemmed i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way if youre debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend id go with these
lovely blouse very well made i had a baby last year and recently weaned so my bust line is changing right now somewhere between a  and c the medium was a little roomy for i couldve easily sized down but i like the airy look so i think i will keep it this size quality fabric very comfortable yet dressy id definitely recommend this blouse

i ordered this in tan and white but ended up returning it the material is a bit thin but soft the shape of the top was decent i didnt think it was too boxy but i didnt like how the seams looked on the sides ultimately i didnt think it was worth the price

these jeans are buttery soft and very flattering unlike many jeans these do not ride down my waist as i wear them i am a bit concerned about them long term as they list rayon as the primary fabric which means they have to be washed very carefully still i highly recommend
i ordered this online i love the sleeves and the pleat in the back but the top runs large i ordered a small but it is too big other reviews say that the top shrinks when you wash it however im not sure if the store would let me return a washed item if it doesnt shrink enough for my taste i think i will probably be returning this top
love this dress really nice quality timeless design not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose the body size and length does run large so size down on this one now i understand why the petites were all sold out whatever modes
i am a fan of flutter sleeves always have been however at  years old i sometimes feel as if i cant carry them off not the case with this shirt bordeaux has found a way to balance just sleeve with femininity and maturity im a size  in jeans and tops i ordered s large and it fit beautifully very flattering
i recently came across this dress in store and decided to try it on i immediately fell in love my husband was patiently waiting outside the dressing area to see it and give his opinion but i knew i was going to get it regardless of his thoughts  this dress could be worn with heel flats sandals booties etc the one drawback i have is the high cut of the wrapover in front as other reviewers have said i plan on wearing this places where i wont be sitting for long periods of time because
i see that many of you like myself fell in love with the look and feel of this sweater and reluctantly bought it even though it sheds like crazy i just wanted to let you all in on a little trick to stop the shedding it will sound strange but it worked like a charm fold up the sweater seal it in a ziploc bag and pop it in the freezer for  hours bam it will shed no more now i can completely love this sweater 
i bought this sweater in the green and loved it so much i ended up ordering the pink also it looks great with jeans or with a pencil skirt the silhouette is flattering and the sleeves though big dont get in the way while im working im a little worried about the looseness of the knit and the amount of lint it shed at first so i dont know how long it will look and feel new also one of the buttons on the pink one was hanging by a thread when i first pulled it out of the package at this
"i found this at my local store on sale and immediately snatched it up i did not think of the wrap flying open until i got home and tried it on again luckily i was able to sew it up enough without compromising the drape and movement of the dress and without causing anyou pulling or puckering which isnt always easy when working with jerseythat said i really like the dress otherwise its super soft and i think ill get a lot of wear out of it when i want something cute and comfy to put on"

i do not love these pants while the fabric is nice they make me look rather dumpy i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender these pants make me look like ive put on  pounds and they also make me look rather squat perhaps they would look good on someone tall but at   these are a miss for me
i have not worn yet but excited to try it out soon with jeans and boots comfy but has a nice sweater looknot too casual sleeves are very long but dont think i want to downsize
beautiful top but the angles emphasized my widest fluffy bits in an unattractive way i ordered size large the material fabric and lace are pretty and well done my arms looked huge too and the piece under the arm hit below my bra and it was clearly visible by a couple inches i carry my weight in my mid section and am short waisted think this would look best on taller thinner bods
 it sheds on my cloths something fierce not much i can do as i dont want to return it because i love it so i love the longer panel in the back and the side slits nice weight and feel i just wish it didnt shed so much
i cant wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel i especially love the detail at the pocket edges very well made the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable this will go great with denim and long skirts the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but thats okay this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so its nice to be able to wear a bit of
this shirt makes me feel stylish without trying i can put this on and feel like a fashion blogger without trying it is comfortable and fits true to size it is flattering at the bottom without too much widthpeplum

this is just the perfect sweater in my opinion i got it in the rose which is a gorgeous subtle color that will go with just about anything i love the knit pattern and the buttons and the sleeves are nice and long which is crucial for me at my height  overall i just see myself throwing this on over everything so im sure i will treasure this for years to come
the only problem with this top is that it only comes in two colors  this is a lightweight easy to wear top that surprises you with the cute design details  it will be easy to wear in the heat of my hometown  i dont think it is too thin and i wont need to add a camisole  i am  and weigh  and i got a small  perfect

this is an average top i thought it would be a good work shirt my office is very causal but it was just too loungey looking fit is true to size the fabric is thin a little see through not worth  in my opinion i returned it
very feminine fun and if you like this style i highly recommend i am a  and both fit the same so i went with the   bust  waistshort torso fabric nice and light and i need no cami very attractive blouse and very retailer
i am not usually one for super girly tops but i could not resist this top the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down i think it is extremely versatile it is a little bit seethrough but if you just wear a nude bra its perfect i usually wear a  or  but i got a  in this top because it is a little tight in the sleevesacross the shoulders but if you size up you should be perfect super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out

"so i recommend wearing with something more fitted or with a flare jeans or tucked in like the picture i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar inside so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit you see hte contrastit is a bit short and i am petite i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise it may have been too shortcolors are nice and i love the material it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm my orffice is freezing should ahve grabbed it"
i am not sure why the first reviewed hated this dress so much i personally like that it looks a tad retro length is shorter but not mini or too short i ordered the xxs p and it looked ok on me and i am older the colors are fun and appropriate for fall or winter the sparkle golden thread can bring this dress into the holiday season and beyond i love the turtleneck part only thing is it is really high and the embroidery gets a little lost in it top of the design feel is thick no
i really love this top it looks so sweet and beautiful and is perfect for dressing up a pair of jeans if you are on the short size it may be a little long so keep that in mind i love it
i ordered this top based on the photos this looked unique and beautiful plus ive loved past designs by this brand i thought this would be nice for summer there isnt a straighton view of the front of the top for a reason the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest away from the border of the rest of the flowers the flower looks kind of like a bee i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem
i so wanted to love this dress but the bell sleeves were enormous if youre standing completely still with your arms down they look cool but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings the rest of the dress was beautiful though and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglasspear shaped figure i would recommend sizing down as the dress runs large
"the pictures do not do this blouse justice the pleat in the front is so flattering that i did a double take this detail doesnt come through the images which is a shame as it is the most beautiful element of this blouse the collar that stands up just enough is something unexpected and the sleeve length is fun yet sophisticated i am madly in love with this blouse and highly recommend it to anyone it is extremely seethroughso unless you want to show off your nips you should expect"
"i read the previous reviews but decided to try it out since retailer was having  off sale itemsit looks very flattering on me and great fit for my body typei would recommend"
i love this more than my pineapple top i am  and wear between a size  in tops got this in size  same as the pineapple and fits perfectly and comfotably the color is white and has a lovely lace pattern i would say it runs a litle on the small side material is a bit more stiff than my pineapple top but i love the way it feels in my opinion this is a staple top you can dress it up for a wedding or just going out its super lovely they were so popular at the retailer near me tw
saw this in the greenville sc store and it caught my eye i ordered a petite a week later and i adore it nice embroidery a little sparkle the sleeves are voluminous but it makes me feel sassy
ordered this in my normal size large in taupe the jacket fit tts the length was cropped but just long enough hit just below my belly button to feel comfortable and not too short for my  height the quality feels good
ok i soo wanted to love this dress if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely i am slim and tall  but am large chested a  i usually wear an  so bought a  it was too tight around my chest and back so i went up a size to a  it was better but not exactly comfortable i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it wouldnt solve my issue
lol on the previous comment about it being a poor mans pineapple blouse i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me im  thus i prefer this blouse i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar if you wear makeup like i do you must find a trick to taking it on and off for me i put it on prior to putting on makeup i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup and dont even think

ive been coveting the first edition of this top pineapples and was thrilled to find this same style with lemons i called my local store and put a few sizes on hold so i could ensure the perfect fit good job i did the top is beautiful but its super tight across the back  fine if you want to stand still  look pretty if however you want to go about your usual activities like eat for example id suggest you size up for reference im usually a  in retailer tops    and 
really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished  not worth full price
i have only worn this  times with no signs of pilling yet it is good for cool spring daysevenings for me itll be the cooler  sweater i wear a size large and it fits properly i have worn lightweight long sleeve knit tees under this with ease in the sleeves i think a slim sleeved shirtblouse would work equally well while i like the idea of the pockets i think theyll stretch out easily beyond a tissue or quick hand warming i removed  star due to the high price and i receive

i also agree with the other reviewers that its important to try on a couple due to pattern differences this dress has a beige base the photo is a little misleading i ended up returning it because the colors didnt do much for me i think they look great on the model but thats because the beige doesnt blend into her at all i also think its a little overpriced for what the dress is a great summer day dress

finally a top that fits true to size is comfortable and is the quality i expect when shopping at retailer i cannot recommend this top more if it came in other color motifs i would buy them too perfect fall transition top
not sure where to start with this topits that good i am usually a large in most maeve tops and thats sizing up for extra flow i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders i wanted more flow as always so i went up in size for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have it has sold out with
"i loved the idea of this dress but i find that it isnt very flattering i think the arm holes are actually very interesting but im  and  and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all maybe it would look better on a different body typethe material is soft but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair"

i wore this dress yesterday for the first time and got several compliments its unique and superpretty in person it hides flaws well and the material is nice i must have bigger arms than the model because you can barely tell from the picture what the arm slits look like i dont mind the way they look butthe way the piece of fabric there grazed on my arms all day kept making me feel like my bra strap had fallen down speaking of bra straps the neckline is wide and i felt like i kept havin

i got this dress and think its just great its a bit formal but a bit whimsical at the same time i really disagree with others said about the opening along the arms i think they are barely noticeable but are nice surprise this is a perfect california winter dress i could see how a woman in colder parts of the country might not appreciate the slits on the arms but i think its nice to show a little skin in a conservative way i plan to wear it to a classical music concert soon and i got i

this is exactly as pictured and fits as it does on the model in the last picture my only hangup is that its a little pricey for a tshirt the fabric is standard tshirt material not stiff but also not super soft which i was hoping for my hubby had no idea what the pattern was til i pointed it out 
i love this dress it is a very casual and loose fit which makes it super comfortable i highly recommend it since it is versatile for fall and spring and can be styled quite a few ways
i bought this tee for the cute print otherwise this tee is nothing special i usually wear an xs but bought an xxs based on how loose the tee looks on the model its pretty thin and more like a slub cotton i think i will hand wash it just in case
"i agree with others that the shape is not perfect it does billow a bit by the hips but the xxs petite someone returned was good on me length was perfect sleeve were not too tights   in waist  in hips  lbscolors are subdued making the jacket more neutral keeping in mind for later"
got for a mother  day gift  think  she will like it because she always at the beach and is very happy go lucky new mother
i was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made the color palette is an added bonus i knew for my height to size up because it looked short i tried on the   felt it was still to short i would have to wear a  or  to get the length i would like i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter i am    a 
"i just think this dress is so cute i love it with booties here are the fit details im   and the front of the dress hits just above my knees i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button however the button is very low therefore the sleeve rolls up not mid arm but actually about three inches above my wrist its still super cute just nowhere near my elbow just letting you knowfinal detail that"
i had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasnt worth it i got an xs and it was quite baggy i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is for someone whos bigger id definitely check this shirt out

"the fabric on this tee is a very very soft thin cotton knit its perfect for those hot muggy summers esp in the southern area of the us the sizing runs larger i am normally an xl and because of the other reviews saying it ran big i got this in a l and it fits me fine and theres room to spare so if you are a size  or  this will fit in a l nicelyits thin but i dont think its immodest or too sheer a white or beige bra would not show through this easily at all the leng"
the colors and fabric on this dress are really pretty the lace is a soft blue instead of white i have other dresses like this from this brand and really wanted to keep it but it runs larger than the others i have also it doesnt have pockets if it fits you properly i think you will love it
the top is cute but when i received it it did not feel like cotton the tag says  viscose i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future on the plus side the return was no problem
love these jeans for summer i followed the advice of previous reviewers and sized down to a  after wearing these for a few hours they stretched a little and fit great they look sweet with the palo alto blouse and the embroidered edessa top highly recommend
ive been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out i love it i was afraid i couldnt pull it off because im  and very petite but i dont think it matters it feels so light and airy and i cant wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts great piece
i tried these on to compare with a different style and didnt like this one a much also ag brand these fit better at the waist but seemed long on me and made me look frump ear i think they are really comfortable adn on the longer legs would be great buy f you are taller than  foot  inches reference i am  lbs and tried on the 
the only thing i didnt like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter but otherwise great throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and springsummerness to your outfit
this dress is beautiful it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it i usually wear a size  in retailer but because it was a button down dress i ordered a size  the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season
i love this shirt it is classic and elegant it is versatile and can go with lots of different things be mindful it is seethrough so you must wear a tank underneath i got it in white and it can be dressed up or down i like how the sleeves are slightly longer than your average shirt definitely recommend
im  and i think fairly proportioned  lbs  and the peplum hit well above my waist since having kids im a little obsessive about avoiding any shirt that could double as maternity and this struck me as one its a cute too but once its on i dont feel its very flattering

as soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging i feel in love with them the fabric was so soft  i could not wait to get them onyeah that was not going to happen i could not pull them on  not even a little bit these pants run incredibly small i ordered them twice once in my regular size and again in a larger size unfortunately i am sized out of these beauties

this jacket is extremely soft and comfortable with a heavier textured fabric i think it is expensive for what it  best to wait for a sale
this top is a keeper subtle plaid flowy fit so cute with skinny jeans and booties i would definitely recommend
i had been looking at the dresses and jumpsuits from this designer for a while and decided to order this jumpsuit im usually an extra small in jumpsuits and wasnt sure to get the  or  im  and about  lbs and the  petite is perfect in the legs and waist but a little wide across the chest im a  the material is soft and feels very nice and like good quality its perfect for dressing up a little in the summer and im going to think of ways to transition it to the f
this is a truly beautiful jacket that goes with so much  dressed up or even over something casual and either way it is comfortable without looking frumpy soft and conforms to your shape without being sloppy i would say it does have more of a sweater feel to it but with the zipper can easily pass as a jacket its lightweight but enough to keep you warm on a spring or fall day i would say it fits pretty true to size i got the ivory during the big weekend sale extra  off but even at 
i saw this dress online and i thought it was perfectly cute however once i tried it on at home it just didnt work one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning and once i got it on the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm im  and  lbs and purchased in size  i didnt even try buttoning all the way i took it back and i dont even think i want a larger size the buttons are just too fragile
this is a lovely dress it is on the heavy side and lined so i would not recommend for hot summer wear but the material and style are adorable the skirt is definitely aline not sheath but i prefer that it runs a tad too tight in the chest so if youre between sizes in the bust id order up that said a  would be too big for me im   lbs and  and usually wear a 
while i agree with the previous review that the peplum hits a bit high i like this top it has other features that i really like the dip in the back of the peplum is great and i love the longer sleeves i have it in both the black and the mauve and they are becoming quick staples in my wardrobe i have a fuller figure and feel good in this top
i wanted to love this blouse but the peplum came too high up on my waist i have a short torso and im busty so the placement of the peplum just didnt work for me it is a very pretty color and fit fine in my normal size but the peplum just didnt work on my short torso i think this would be a very pretty blouse for people with a different body type than mine
super soft and comfy so far not stretching out but still recommend buying down a size
i ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom it is too pricey to live up to my expectations it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you cant see in the pictures this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap it is made of viscose and dry clean only the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion if it had been real silk or another natural fiber ok but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me
"this is a very comfortable dress i absolutely love the design the feel structured and has weight and the  sleeves perfect dress for brunch and work the fit is not giving in the chest area i needed to go up a size due to the inflexibility of the material even tried it without a bra nope wasnt a happening i ordered a size up and love itthe only con are the buttons they are very thin and not a good choice for the heavy fabric broke one in the fitting room"
love this timeless piece but it was a bit looser fitting than i expected i consistently wear xs so i had an idea of how i thought it would fit i still kept it though because you can dress it up or down and it will never go out of style
these shorts are great both the design and fit are beautiful i would say that these run true to size i bought my usual size  and they fit perfectly they fit a little high waisted which i love the material is so soft and are so comfortable i would recommend these shorts if youre thinking about it
beautiful shorts im   lbs and athleticmuscular build the  fit perfect which is my true size great print that will go with plenty of different colors i feel like you can dress it up or go more casual
this jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit jumpsuits are always tricky for me but this one fits like a dream i would say it runs true to size with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part thats not typically a problem for me being a  i dont think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais
since there isnt one where i live i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up saw this and bought it off the rack wout trying on had to get a m as they were out of s and yes its a tad large on me but still glad i got it i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch

i tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo i wore it one time and received so many compliments when i washed it however it shrunk almost  size the pant legs were high water i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldnt budge i think because rayon is not stretchable material to my disappointment i returned it i really wished it would have worked out
i thought this top was absolutely beautiful online and it doesnt disappoint in person the fabric is divine and i just love the paisley design after putting it on though it did look just a tad boxy but not enough to return it i would definitely recommend the top and maybe a cute belt to accompany
i like the fabric and aesthetic of this top and really wanted to like it however i wish it were longer i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes but even the medium felt short and clingy however that might be because im curvy with a long torso so id definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online
this is a beautiful tunic dress and the detail makes it so soft and feminine i would never have bought it online because it looks so plain but in the store today just couldnt believe how pretty im mature so i plan to wear with black leggings and a nice scarf but could easily be worn alone or with jeans i think it will transition into spring for two season wear im small but large busted size   h braand the small was perfect cant wait to wear it
"like the idea but the tee was was very boxy i tried the size small and it fit at the shoulders but the body was very big i would say they pinned it for the product photoim  a size small it was soft and fun but a no for me at this price"
i saw this jacket in stores but did not buy it i went home but could not get this trendy jacket out of my head i returned to the store the very next day and purchased this item i am very pleased with the quality and think that the fit could go well on most body types i got the denim color which may not be the best color for all but i love it because denim is timeless and very versatile i would suggest this to anyone and could not be happier with this go out and buy it now you wont re

this is a lovely dress the shape is really flattering and its light and easy to wear the only problem i have is it runs a little big  im normally a  and im sizing down to a  otherwise its pretty perfect the length is good for taller women im  and the bodice is sturdy enough that smaller cup sizes wont need a bra definitely recommend this
i am   and i ordered the regular s if i left it the way it came it would have been lowwaisted and too long so i am having the waist taken in a couple of inches so it is now high waisted and the length is fine with heels i did not opt to exchange for a smaller size as the derriere fit fine it anyway does not define your shape much in the rear agree that fabric is lighter than expected but the color and drape are nice it has stitchedin shorts that fall above the knee i think wi
great fir and very flattering keep in mind that its a little low cut some bras may not be low enough or may show
very pleased with my purchase the subtle details within the dress add to its simple elegance very soft and comfortable definitely recommend

i was really excited to get this top in the mail unlike other reviewers i didnt find that the top fit small but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didnt look good with the billowy torso of the top i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls but im very tall and broad shouldered so it didnt look as good on me
im petite and i ordered the smallest size possible online   i ordered the rainumbrella pattern which is cute and very retailer in my opinion for those who are experiencing gapping at the buttons over bust area  wear a tank inside and problem is solved hoping they would come out with cuter prints in the future
this is top makes me feel happy and pretty with a saturdaysunday black tank or any cami you will love yourself in it tts and matches most any skirt good price too can wear with skirts or pants
perfect shirt for a lowkey day at the office bought in the umbrellarain white print maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but thats what i love about them material is nice recommend hand wash
such a cute take on a henleybutton down shirt i first bought the green and blue version in my typical size medium and while it was bigger than i expected it to be i kept it because i liked the oversizedtunic look i got with some skinny jeans and boots i decided to order this color in a small to get a different look im just as pleased with the fit of the smaller size i think this size will work better for tucking in and more tailored looks yea these shirts are so soft and made of substan
contrary to what previous reviewers have said i think this top fits really well and is very flattering i also dont find it too long at all i normally wear a size small and got this in a size  no gapping at the chest and im a    lbs  and the colors in the striped version are really pretty i plan to wear it now and right through spring i did have a quality issue however the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po
i adore this top the fit is amazing the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring i think it looks great with skinny jeans i am built small up top size m and the  fit perfectly the buttons did not gape at all
i grabbed this during a  off sale so i will state first that i dont think this top is worth full price and even at  off i wasnt wowed enough to pay that much for it the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty however the cut both the length and the width just made it too overwhelming on my size  frame i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it didnt flow over my hips as well because its so long i think

i really love this dress because it can be dressed up with wedges or heels for a wedding or cocktail party but could also be dressed down with a cute pair of gladiators i love the pockets too im very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone who needs a goto summer dress for many occasions
i cant believe these arent sold out yet  i had no problem getting this over my head  this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery  quality is good  flattering on  at this price it is probably the best deal ive gotten on anything from retailer  i would recommend this top absolutely
love love love but alas had to return gorgeous fabric and elegant design i purchased for an evening summer wedding however the cut of this dress is more suited to a small bust line and a short waist i felt like it hit at my rib cage and not my natural waist and my top half was spilling out of the neckline it was slightly loose so i dont think sizing up would have helped maybe i needed to size down im   lbs and had the  loved but it didnt fit me properly also noticed the
this is a very beautiful and wellmade skirt it looks a little like ribbon material it is very think and lush and the pockets add a little extra special to it the waist band is very sturdy and it wears very flattering even putting my hands in the pockets feels very thick and silky i am  with a  waist and the size  fit really well just above the knee

"i tried on the xs in store in crimson i would need petite  the color and fit were very flattering on me pale skin the dress feels very silky i love the back how it ties and how high the neckline was on me in the front the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work reference  lbs   in waist"
this skirt is exactly as i had hoped it would be the zipper works great the material feels nice and the liner is attached to the skirt so there is no bunching effect after the first time i wore the skirt i went out and bought more tops to go with it i highly recommend this skirt
the style and material are nice but what i love is that it does not give me a wedgie and i think it would still fold nicely on shorter frames
i paired this gorgeous top with a black vneck cardigan mother lookers and black booties and felt and looked so totally feminine and amazingi honestly lost count of the compliments that i received  beading is sewn on tightly and the stitching on the embroidery has no loose ends  i am  and took the regular size small  highly recommend
super comfy easy to put on and super cute you can dress it up and dress it down im usually a size s and the small fits fine but i think the xs would have fit better
i am  and got this in a  i would say it fits tts the top also has some give but the waist is just a few inches away from being empire i think the dress on the model is pulled down to deemphasize this even so it is a very cute dress  plan to wear it with a navy velvet jacket for easter
this top is not for a curvy figure the embroidered part is gorgeous very stunning but the loose bottom part is awful i am curvy and usually wear l or xl this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom made me feel like i had a big tummy and was a tad short i am sending this back this would look better on a more slender frame
finally a jumper that works for me i am  but i have a long torso so most jumpers ride up in an uncomfortable way this one is perfect the material is light and perfect for warm weather the top is very adjustable for all different chest sizes i personally think the pant length looks better if you are under  because it comes down closer to the ankle but then again if you have long thin legs you might not mind the bottom hitting at your calf i cant say enough good things about this jum

i bought this dress for my sisters bridal shower and it was a hit i was a little bit surprised when it arrived because i did think it was going to be actual tweed  it is not it is simply a tweed pattern i think it makes a little bit more casual but it was a fun dress for an afternoon bridal brunch one thing i wish it had  pockets

i found this to be a very feminine and flattering dress it is prettier in person i have the ivory and black print i agree that it takes a bit of effort to get the slip positioned properly i might wear a different slip however i was able to get the slip to stay in place the print and fabric are a nice quality i typically wear an xxsp or a  i bought this in the  regular because i like my dresses a little bit longer i think it runs just a little bit small
perfect for when youre a guest at someones home  having guests or just lounging   prettiest set youll ever own youll feel as if your on vacation even if youre not i wouldnt travel without this set  highly recommend love

i have an upsidedown triangle shape i am a  on the bottom and a  on top i have a short waist i have very slim hips and virtually no waist so a typical jumpsuit or romper really doesnt fit me this one is the exception likely because it ties in the back but the s fit me perfectly the bottom half is easy but not oversized the top half of the jumpsuit is adjustable so there is no issue with size i am  on top but i think that i could pull off the top without a bra you can
i fell in love with this dress the second i saw it in store i havent experienced any of the issues others have i love the short flowy feminine look and i think it can be dressed up or down it would be great for a summer wedding or cocktail event or dressed down as a day dress with a jean jacket ive received compliments every time ive worn it
the sweater is a great fit and the styling is very original and wonderful it will be great with leggings jeans or even a straight skirt i would definitely recommend this sweater
i initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy im tall  and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled its a very versatile piece with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater either look is nice i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version also the fabric doesnt feel thick but it is very insulating and
this robe is so pretty i kind of feel like a movie star when i wear it the embroidered flowers and trim are a very nice touch the fabric is very light and soft im sure it will feel nice and cool on those hot summer nights ahead the fit is true to size and is actually a bit longer than what is shown on the model i am extremely happy i decided to make this purchase

i usually wear stevies in ag but when i saw the prima was on sale i decided to give it a try and im so glad i did they came today and i tried them on i will say the rise feels a little higher than midrise but its so soft and stretchy i didnt really care theyre definitely skinny but with so much stretch they feel like a comfortable legging that doesnt fit quite so tightly the colorwash is great too for this price these are awesome i ordered a  same as my stevies and it fit per
buy this robe before its gone my friend and i each bought this robe it feels amazing and makes a girl feel pretty i bought the xss   waist but i tried on the ml and could have made that work too love
ive been looking for a nice affordable robe for awhile and this is the one its so soft and the design makes you feel fancy when you wear it perfect for lounging doing my nails or wearing a face mask
this dress is a keeper fits true to size comfortable and love the pockets it can be a casual day dress or add some jewelry for a night time dinner out i was concerned with the fabric being a velvet material but is very light and comfortable
its impossible to tell but this dress is made from very fine wale corduroy the neckline is very flattering for a smaller chested woman with a sharp cut that makes a strapless bra required for peace of mind the dress does have snaps to hold your bra straps in but i went ahead with a strapless the back has a neat square cut the skirt is slightly longer on both sides which gives the dress movement even though the material is heavier than typically used for this season or cut i wore it
i fell in love with this online and im so thrilled that its even more beautiful in person it is a stunning very dark teal velvet with the most gorgeous embroidery perfect fit quality and nicely lined a keeper for years to come i think its true to size for reference im   lbs and the  fits perfectly
unbelievably soft fabric that doesnt feel like it will pill i ordered dark grey im   just after baby and size m fits well superflattering doesnt smash my buns the seams are in all the right places to flatter styling is between ballerina and badass as i think the ankle wraps look a little tough i highly recommend

hi this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion very feminine it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric love it
i like the casual yet detailed look of this piece it looks great with crops the casual tie string makes the piece feel very laid back but the details are so pretty i have it in lavender it looks way better in person saw it at the store and grabbed it immediately
i bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size  beware i have a  chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the  it was a thick polyester type material i think this shirt would still work f
this top is cute it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy as another reviewer pointed out the peplum is only in the front it sounds really weird but i dont really mind the look because ill be wearing a jacket over it im usually a size  with a  bust and the large fits beautifully
this is a great looking top but the sizing is way off in the photo it looks a little oversized i am normally a medium but this one was very small sleeves several inches too short and it is more like  long instead of the  listed on the description in the right size i think it will be great but im not sure whether to go up one size or two
when i got this top in the mail i was impressed by the colors they were very vibrant and i loved the feel of the material as well however the top did not look good on i have an hourglass figure with a dd bust and the peplum just made me look like i didnt have a waist the arm holes were also very big and showed my bra overall i think this is a very cute top but would probably be better on women with more athletic figures

im  and bought the dress in a petite medium i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short if it were any shorter it wouldnt have worked if i were to buy it again id probably go with a nonpetite size also i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box i dont think they will be terribly noticeable but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily i plan to wear it with a purse without meta
i picked this up on sale and was glad i did  the material is just the right thickness for some of the chilly days we have here in spring in the northeast the fit is right on but size up if you are unsure or inbetween the detail down the back is adorable and adds a point of interest to this sweatshirt the fit is boxy  but i think it compliments and balances the overall girly design
this dress did not work well on my figure i have a small waist and broad hips and the dress size m for  lbs  was too boxy i didnt have objections to the fabric like other reviewers  honestly even if there were a snag or two the fabric is kind of rustic and i dont think a snag would look terrible depending on where it is i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f
i love the colors of this top it does run very large though when i received my usual small i felt like i was swimming in the top not fitted at all the material is a bit funky too  seems a little lower quality because of the fabric will return and try a smaller size if there is one available at the store and see if i change my mind
this dress is beautiful and unusual i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i boughtthe turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person which isnt necessarily a bad thing there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also cant see in the picture but they arent gaudy or too stevie nicksbohemian i didnt find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer notedits my normal size and though im a little chesty 
i thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt not at all im either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight it is more fitted if you are looking for something more comfy dont buy however if you want more of a fitted blouse feel then go for it
this dress is so cute and so flattering i loved the shape but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better
ordered my regular size  they were tight when they arrived but they stretch  a lot i like the looser style so was vey pleased but think they are at least a size larger after one wear
i wanted to like this so much its a great good girl dress church dress however it makes no sense its a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags im petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide
i did the happy dance when the dress arrived but the very sad dance when i tried it on unfortunately instead of following my instincts i took the review here and reviews from some other sites to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual  huge mistake as in this dress was huge  much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design for reference im    i usually wear an  dress due to a very large rib cage i ordered the  but was literally swimming i think a  woul
i was intrigued by this topits very cute but i feel that the tassels are just slightly too big and if the fringe would have been a little more subtle the top would be cuter im still on the fence with this one
this vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives i love the fact that its lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice has a good solid quality feel to it it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest more on the conservative side of retailer

great for the beachy business look classy but immensely comfortable i feel like i look sharp without having to sit pokerstraight
i came into the store to try another dress on and was given this dress to try it is perfect i paired it with black tights and tall boots for a family photo i got it in the wine color highly recommend and very fun for winter it does run really large i usually wear a small but got an extra small
"i bought this on a whim  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit especially online  this suit is structured so well  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher  the material i feel holds in my stomach i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this   the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece"

this dress is really beautiful i have already worn it to both an engagement party fancy and just out to dinner casual it fits most occasions depending on what you pair it with which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full moneys worth ive gotten several compliments on it the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it it looks true to the picture on the website the dres
the dress is great for pear shapes however i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing ordered a small   and i still think it may be a bit big the material is very comfortable not too thick or thin however i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric see the attached photo

i love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine i find the cut very flattering and slimming and love the pockets it works great for northern california winters with tights boots boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors and on its own indoors i wish there was a longsleeved version i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it good job sparrow btw i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress the mockneck dress and this one is just an inc
i wanted to love this dress i ordered it when there was a  percent off special and couldnt wait to get it the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size i also liked that it wasnt too short what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white which you can plainly see in the picture but i didnt notice before ordering i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black im disappointed and the dress is going back
i loved this dress before putting it on but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for sadly this will be going back i loved the print and the feel of the material just not a flattering cut for me
so cute so comfortable so pretty  so i guess i love everything about it it is not too short on me and i think you can wear it in many ways thought of adding a vest  thought of boots  cant wait to wear it i agree the material is substantial so it isnt flimsy for fall or winter happy with this purchase runs true to size i went with the op i sometimes chose regular length but this one is just right in the petite i have long arms but these sleeves are just right i am  ft tall b
i wanted to love this dress i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful both the print and the material then i tried it on and it fit like a tent i am just under  and it hit right below my knees not like shown in the picture here on that note i passed on this one due to the fit i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though
i know this is labeled under activewear but the fabric is a dream its incredibly flattering and could absolutely be worn in any outfit i just bought the moss and may end up getting the other colors too i generally am a l or xl and the large fit well its alined and has a bit of stretch to it its so comfortable highly recommend
this dress is very comfortable and casual but in a high quality fabric that makes it great for a summer dinner with dressy sandals i dont think a bra can be worn with it which i dont mind at all but might be a problem for others

these citizens of humanity jeans are indeed pricy but worth the money they fit slim through the hips and not too loose in the legs to make you feel like they are hugevery versatile and look fabulous with a cropped sweater or even a hip length top add a pair of chunky shoes and you have a great look i even tried them with dansko clogs and they looks cute its a great break from skinny jeans and much more chic than boyfriend jeans

i think this dress is very pretty and i like that its made of silk  i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy  what i dont like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress  the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back you can see similar in the model shot from behind  for the price i was expecting a little more quality control  i also do not care for the lining  i do not think the off white is

i loved this dress when i saw it online i could not wait until i see in one of the local stores  i bought it today unlike other reviews i think this dress runs large i am a  and bought the zero maeve tends to run large on me i would suggest that you try a size smaller it looks very flattering

i got one of these tanks and went back and bought two more online i have the gray green and white the white requires a undershirt for me but thats no problem the shirts are darling theyre under activewear and i think they could be used that way but i definitely dont theyre simple but have a nice flow and the front and back are perfect i love the material and the colors i would buy more if there was more in more natural tones i dont love bright colors but i love the green white
a seasonal must have nicely made medium weight cozy buttons to half way down i am petite and the xs fits with enough room for layers underneath highly recommend
wish this worked for me i am  it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot the neck was kind of tight on me too i love the idea of this dress but need it longer the dress is very roomy overall
the dress is very pretty however the description is deceiving i purchased it not just for the look but because it was listed as silk but that is not exactly true the underslip is silk but the outer dress what you see is definitely not it is a cheap thin material on top skirt is stiff not loose or flowy as the picture would have you think i will keep it very happy i did not pay full price
this cut and shape of this skirt is very flattering i am normally a medium but the small fit and looked much better less bulky the material is nice almost sweater like but not so heavy its a very versatile skirt highly recommend
these are very pretty but i have had a few problems with them out of the package i found them to be true to size i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs however even though they are machine washable i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short i am barely over  tall also the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing which drives me crazy i have to keep straightening it i think there are better options for sleep pants

"i recommend this topper but with reservations it is beautiful looking especially the lace portion it is also very wide the gathered portion is a complete design fail it balloons up right below the bust making one look wide and pretty ridiculous its obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise i ordered size s the smallest available and it fit very wide more like a"
i was shopping for a holiday outfit today at my retailer store and my sales associate suggested i try on this top i have lo idea where it was on the store l yet its a very pretty top that stands out when you have it on i took this in a small because its meant to run shorter i felt xs would have been too small i purchased it to wear with jeans or dress pants pretty detail blouse shows off my arms and minimizes my waist i love it
these jeans fit great but i think getting the right size is key i bought my usual denim size  and at first i thought they were too tight but as the day wore on they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove if i bought them in a larger size im afraid theyd bag out like jeans tend to do i think its the legging style that makes them so form fitting i wish they were ankle length like on the model but im  and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model

when i unwrapped this a chemical stink hit me that amost knocked me over it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out i do not recommend this fo
i ordered this coat in a size xs during the promo it just arrived  is too big sleeves way too long  big under the arms its labeled xs but looks more like a m i dont mind an oversized fit  having the sleeves altered but this is just not working if petite were available it may work for me it is nicely made soft comfy button front which i prefer instead of snaps i think it wld be super cozy on a cold day love the print i am of small build   usually a xss occas petite

"i had higher hopes for this top and thought it would be fanicer but as a previous reviewer mentioned the quality of the material and elastic waistband makes the top look a little cheaper in person im glad i got it on sale with the extra  offi was hoping to exchange it for a small but its sold out by now the top runs a little large normally im between a small and a medium but i think a small might even be too big i put it on this morning in the dark and by the time i got to work"
"love the mara hoffman basketweave bikini bottoms in fractals red i went to her website for the size chart and got these in a size m very good fit just a bit cheekier than her classic cut bikini bottoms i got them with the matching basketweave bikini topim  currently  to  depending on where i measure upper hipbones are  fuller thighs and bottom so i never know what to order i think a size s would be too skimpy so i hope these hold up well in the waves co"
i disliked this dress it didnt fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured i think it would work well for tall thin women with a smaller chest i am petite with a larger chest and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time not recommended for petite women
this is a beautiful well designed top the pattern is laid out to match on each side the back has a narrow center insert of sheer fabric for an interesting detail with wonderful construction this sheer fabric is also added to the bottom as an edging  this measures only   wide and lays flat and finished off well the sleeves have excess fabric for comfort but do not make ones arms look heavy the unusual neckline shape in the front is well sewn and lays flat nicely i think this top is
i ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening after seeing the other reviews i wasnt sure about it but i was very pleased when it arrived i find it is elegant and sexy but also modest enough when i sized up by  i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly it is formfitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight im excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace
i think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type just not mine im   and a  a couple weeks post partum thought this could be a good shirt while im nursing bc its flowy but stylish unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on the cut drew all attention to my big chestnot in a good wayand distracted from my smaller lower half made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am probably good for small chested girls very tall girls or curvy on the
these looked so fun i had to have them i usually wear a  in pants but the large fit well despite a lack of thigh gap and walking in these all night i didnt lose a single sequin theyre comfortable and get a ton of compliments if youre considering them i definitely recommend going for it
these are great pants i was nervous because when i saw them at the store they looked pretty linty but after wearing them a number of times they are not bad i have to run a lint roller over them occasionally but not more than other black pants i wear these to work and they are very comfortable kind of stretchy but very flattering the higher rise than the other stevies makes them work really well for workallows them to look less jean like i highly recommend thesecant believe they aren
i love these jeans cant believe i never purchased them earlier im always a  in paige and ag and this was no different i will say that i did fit into the  so it could be that they run slightly large the fabric is amazing and the white is perfect love that it is not see through and fabric is substantialthe length for me at  was at my ankle i loved them so much that i bought them in white and beigecream highly recommend
i think these jeans are amazing they are very flattering and most of all comfortable i often will go up a size when buying white but i didnt have to with these they also relax very nicely as you wear them buying white jeans has always been a challenge often they are to thin and not that flattering i dont feel the same about these they are the perfect summer white jean i think i need another pair

i have owned a lot of stevies in the past the only problem with them for me has been the rise i have always thought they would have been perfect with a bit of a higher rise voila these have the perfect mid rise for me they are really soft too long for my  inch inseam they bunch at the ankles but dont drag i would love for them to have a skinnier ankle but i also think theyre fine how they are i bought my normal size they may turn out to be a tiny bit loose after wearing them t
this shirt is enormous and as the title of my review suggests it looks like a mens button down the fabric is quite sheer but thats actually what i liked best about it i just looked completely shapeless in this top  wish i had realized it before i wore it out because i would definitely have returned it perhaps if i had bought it  sizes smaller i might have liked it better  it didnt fit anything like the model photos suggest  its huge not easyslouchy
"gorgeous color plum and is very comfy the lace at the top is just enough to be feminine but not too much to be trashylike many of the other reviewers i sized this down and am glad that i did i think the larger size would have been tent like"
the dahlia bell sleeve blouse is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion i have already worn it several times with white cropped denim or the cropped fringed pilcro denim jeans it also looks great with the pilcro rolled shorts in navy or white i took my usual size large and though the fabric seems like it may be sheer if you wear a nude bra you do not need a cami beneath the blue band hits right about the waist of your jeans so your jeans dont show thru either this blouse is lightweight and v
"i tried this on in the store in regular size i often need petite i think on this one i could go either waythe cut is flattering fit and flare and the colors are rich i like the flowery design good spring piece in my opinion as it has components of all kinds of seasons sleeveless and seethough material buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy very soft not too flimsy iether"

i loved this top when i saw it online and ordered it right away however the fit is way off i am always a size medium always but i was swimming in this and had to return it even if it had fit i wasnt thrilled with it i thought it would be something i could dress up especially with the lace detail but instead it looked really frumpy i would recommend this top as long as you know to order a smaller size and are looking for something a little more casual
i absolutely love the dahlia bellsleeve blouse this blouse has a lovely flow perfect for fall sleeves have a slight bell that hang nicely i would recommend this blouse to everyone
first off this top is super cozy i adore an easy top that has beautiful detail  and this one does the fabric is a lot like a thermal shirt but not too warm its very stretchy not sure if it will stretch out with wear but you could easily size down the body has a ton of room because of the cute cut you could wear it oversized without it drowning you or you could size down to keep it more slim the lace is simple and even more beautiful in person i highly recommend this one  especia
im not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday im always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one thats how large it was even the xs had plenty of room im   lbs  for reference the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway it was on sale plus  off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends its comfortable on and loved the lace detail
"color of the dress matches color on my monitor the neckline is sheer i am   lbs  and ordered a size  i thought it fit perfect this is a great springsummer dress and can be worn with dress heels or flats for a dressier look it can also be worm with tennis shoes white converse are my choice for a more casual looki think this dress could also transition to a fallwinter piece paired with tights and a suit jacket or cardigan also i love the pockets though i do see ho"
really cute stress i love the pattern and feel that this dress you can easily dress up or dress down the neckline is the main reason why i bought the dress it is a dress that hits above my knees so i like how modest it is the slightly open back is also a nice touch its a dress that can easily be dressed up or dressed down perfect spring dress
im always on the hunt for good white blouses to pair with business casual attire or everyday wear this was a great tank i love the fabric its nice and sturdy and you dont have to worry about wearing a cami beneath it this fabric does wrinkle some so bear that in mind i really like the shape of the top near the shoulders its a great conservative cut the little criss cross detail on the back adds a bit of charm to the top i would definitely recommend this to others

this is a beautiful and wellmade top sadly it just didnt work for me im  with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short the shortness mightve worked if it wasnt as baggy as it was i dont mind baggy loosefitting tops but this was so much so that it was just unflattering it looked a bit boxy as well
was looking for a top with this style i ordered this top wondering if it would fit in the hip area after reading the size chart it showed a close fit the answer is yes theres room to spare which is a good thing i like the nubby front material and the hemlines asymmetrical style ill be layering this top with sweaters and jackets all winter very soft feeling fabric wouldnt mind another one in a different color
this is a light so fun to wear shirt its delicate and can be worn to dress up jeans i would very much recommend it love it
i ordered this shirt last week and i wore it as soon as it arrived it is a beautiful shirt with an original design it is rather casual but you can dress it up with the right accessories the print appears to be navy it was advertised as black and it looks great with jeans i would certainly recommend this item
a must for every closet very flattering fit  although i think the white is slightly boxier than the chambray
super cute and flow mine had a bit of stitching problem so i am exchanging it for the same thing fabric feels great def recommend
this sweater is very cute it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear i am a smallmedium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing i have the blue and oatmealbeige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe
i am     lbs and ordered a m in this im usually between a s and m it was too big and didnt have any shape to it i dont think a s would fit much better also i ordered the pink but it was really a coral if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color but they dont ill have to return this it looks so cute online
love these jeans they fit great they feel great i am   pounds they fit everywhere you would like them to unroll them and they are long love love love so wonderful i just bought my second pair
i remember the first time i walked into an retailer store like walking into a dream of all my favorite things ive finally found a store whose products help me to express myself as a writer i love whimsical  out of the ordinary i have found my honey hole every time one of the pastel bags wribbon handles is past over the counter or i push add to cart on my computer i do a little happy dance in my heart my closet is like a candy store filled with sweets  treats thank you retailerp
when i saw this sweater online i honestly didnt think it was really anything special however when i saw it in my local retailer store i really liked the knit as well as the color kind of an off white pinkish i decided to give it a try i have to say that i really like this sweater a lot the cut is quite flattering even though it is baggy and it is very soft i think it will look very cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots this winter glad i decided to give it a try

i have been looking for a vest this winter and i saw this one online i am a huge fan of swing tops i dont care for super fitted clothes the knit says part wool so i was expecting it to be a little scratchier however when i got it it is so soft and more cotteny feel to it than wool but has the warmth of wool when wearing it i really have to try not to wear it everyday just love this vest its my favorite purchase this season i am a size  in tops and i can either do a med or a large i
the sweater looks cute if you get the right size it meant to look a little oversized i think the color is pretty in person however it looks different online and in person so keep that in mind the material is very warm and a little itchy you will need to wear it over a long sleeve undershirt the look is nice but it is for a cold day

i got an xs in this suit  i am     this was much much too small  it was very tight around the chest and i am only a   it is however a good looking suit  i suggest sizing up
the are so comfortable flattering and i feel i can wear them with a lot of styles dress them up or down it all looks good great product make more like this please
this is a fun cozy sweater i feel you can dress it up and use it casual too i bought the ivory in size s im  although i put it runs true to size its is a tad tight around my upper arms not uncomfortable i have normal to somewhat skinny arms so i dont think it was my body type i didnt check other sweaters in the same size to see if it was an isolated case it is to be worn loose it has quite a bit of material all around mid to lower part just fyi

my normal size  in the hyphen chinos fits my size  body very well these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips too loose in the waist and too tight in the knees and i dont have big knees also the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length cuffed they seem to have a  inch inseam and these were regular not tall basically i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves and very long legs for this jean to work
i found this set once while browsing the website i fell in love with it and kept a photo of the set so i could save up to purchase it as luck would have it my mom surprised me with a gift card so i applied it to my purchase im so happy with the set its wonderfully flattering and makes me feel sexy i want one in every color
recommend this vest  nice design  fabric is thicker than expected  might suggest a size smaller  plenty of room in loose styling

i think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs im   lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side  i usually like soft denim i usually wear a  and thought they were true to size
these jeans are perfect in every way i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on they look great  highly recommend
after reading other reviews i ordered a small my usual size is a m it was huge all around its a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top
i think this sweater is well executed for what it isa chunky knit trapeze sweater i agree with another reviewer that i would ignore this product online but it caught my eye in person there was only one of the pink sweaters left in store the interwoven peachy heathery color is sweet and flattering since im  i ordered had the petite version to try hope it works out cuz im eager to own something relaxed and cozy thats actually flattering and isnt a sweatshirt
i had been eyeing this top for awhile so decided to snag it when it went on sale im still on the fence i love the material and pattern but it is really long and im  it looks very roomy with jeans but i still want to try it with tights and boots to see if that looks better overall i think it is a great piece
in nature pilco fashion these jeans are amazing i wear them rolled down they have a slight boot cut but not overly i am  and the bottoms fall right to my heel meaning the hem doesnt drag on the groundfinally the perfect pair of jeans they also do not stretch out and keep shape after wearin all day highly recommend although a little pricy for pilcro worth the splurge
there were no reviews its an online exclusive and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material on the white version of this it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful as a busty  i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph im an anth
i tried on this jumpsuit on a whim and bought it immediately finding a jumpsuit for my body type is hard small chest rounder in the middle and hips like whoa but i have to say this one is ridiculously flattering love the quality and feel of the fabric ive worn it both braless and with a bandeau and have not needed to wear a shirt underneath but then again it isnt a piece i plan to wear to work im usually a sz  and got the medium regular which is perfect im  and the bottom hit
i love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf i think they make the leg look stunted the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed
this sweater is a great oversized warm and very soft cozy winter treasure it is very comfortable to wear and looks cute on i really believe it would be flattering on almost anyone i highly recommend it especially now that it is on sale
"i love this jumpsuiti would like to first say that while a gorgeous model i actually think this piece looks even better on different body shapes sizing i love the shape the style and the comfort i tried it on in a dressing room where it turns out another woman was trying it as well i am  and usually wear a  or  and got the small she was a bit shorter and pettte and it looked fabulous on her it is loose all over and so flow and fabulous it hits me where it hits the mod"
i loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit but found it to be far too short in the torso and about  too long in the leg but thats a lot easier to fix i tried sizing up but it still wasnt working for me im only  and while im longwaisted i can usually make jumpsuits work if you have a short torso and long legs this is a beautiful option otherwise i cant recommend it
i fell in love with this jumpsuit at first sight the color is stunning and very striking i found it to run a bit large so would suggest sizing down for optimal fit but all in all a great piece for summer that will transition nicely into early fall
"i bought this instore after seeing it online and am in love with the shape the cropped legs give it a style advantage in my opinion  for reference im   and a bcup i got the xs the torso was too baggy and lost its shape with a small  as one reviewer mentioned it seems to be meant to be worn with a shirt underneath ive tried with longer sleeved tops and with tank tops and they both look great  especially white it has a modern cut and is very versatile i plan to wear"
i got the small even though i usually order a medium for sweaters because i prefer them bigger and im glad i got the small the sleeves are very long which i love and the sweater is also loose fitting also love the color is gorgeous and it is thick but super soft i wouldnt wear anything underneath it unless tucked in because the front just comes to the top of my pants overall its gorgeous and i would definitely recommend this
this sweater was exactly what i was hoping for it is true to size it actually is cozy which i love in the winter the color is so pretty the quality is good it is fun and stylish i do recommend it
"i love this dress so very much i wish i could keep it but it doesnt look right on me i am     waist  hip dress fit me well except for the fact that it made me look very wide i think the combination of the ruffles on the sleeves with the blouseyness and my short stature was not a great combo it will be amazing on tall slender women but did not flatter my short frame  otherwise beautiful"
i bought this in the plum  love the color i got this in xs which is my usual size  its a little bit baggy but i think this is the style of the sweater the front on me is not as long as pictured but just covers the top of my pants my daughter liked it so much she bought the exact same one
i love everything about this sweater its well made the color is lovely and best of all i can wear it with skinny jeans without feel overexposed in the back i think my husband thought it was rather shapeless but i like the look of a bigger sweater with a skinny pant a must buy at this great price

ive been wanting to try the cropped pleated pants style and i like these the material is nice  comfortable and the bow adds whimsy compared to other brands ive tried these pants fit the best the waistband goes up higher in the back so theres no gapping a big plus for me just one thing i find cartonnier to run small so i would suggest ordering one size bigger
fits perfectly and is quite adorable too keep in mind is that where its cut off on the leg is a bit awkward if youre not wearing heels
"i tried this in an xxsp i am normally an ssxp or xsp it fit me well everywhere except in the crotch where i was given a slight wedgie not the look i was going for if i sized up the rest of the jumpsuit would be too large on my frame also i dont feel the quality matched the price point the one i received had a lot of loose stings already and it was unopened previously that being said it is a beautiful color and on the right body the style would work well it just wasnt for me"
after reading the reviews i was hoping to be able to try this on in store i was able to try on a xxs and a xs in the store on the sale rack i tried both on and i usually will take an xs or small in sweaters funny but the xxs seemed to be a little longer in the front and the fit is nicer on me after reading others review of this sweater i thought for sure it would be super short on the xxs but it wasnt just goes to show you should always try on first i did not feel that the sleeves were l
i tried this on at antho today and loved it the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors it is flattering in person the fabric is a light fabrici was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer but this is probably better anyway with spring coming it is coming righttoday its snowing i like the underlayer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it it is versatile and could be paired with anything
and hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous i think how it fits depends alot on body type the material is nice color pretty not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine
"more importatn super soft matieral and comfortbale hwoever when i put it on ilfelt like i was wearing a robe i do like the detial in the fabric but jsut dindt feel right as cardigan maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robetrue to size tried on xs maybe petite would work too"
the pants are pretty and run true to size but the fabric is bathing suit like very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat i wouldnt recommend for anything but waking
this sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable  i really wanted it to work a small fit my   lb frame well  but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately  tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end its going back i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip

i tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and theres not much to the design it is true to size  my usual size  fit well enough im on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed she also thought it made her shoulders look broad personally i liked it on
i wanted so badly to love this dress but i couldnt get past the thin material that you can actually see through not for this price anyhow the dress is shorter than i had anticipated and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isnt accurately portrayed in the photo on the positive though the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning but alas will be returning
i saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down with skirts leggings trousers jeanswith a vest jacket or sweater or on its own it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule
i picked this tunic up on sale it works wonderfully with several of my cardigans and vests just add skinny jeans or leggings and some boots for a fun super comfortable look the sleeves are oddly extra long but not a deal breaker as rolling them up gives that unfinished cool look i hate ironing but i will iron this top as its so much fun to wear the embroidered and beaded detail is quite nice
"i wasnt sure how this dress would be sized so i ordered it in two different sizes and kept the smaller one i would say it does run a little bit large but not muchi agree with other reviewers that the dress came kind of wrinkled but overall the dress is like it was pictured i think that this dress might be better for taller women  i am  and i think it fits well but i could see how it would not be flattering if i were much shorter overall i am excited to wear this"

i was really looking forward to this dress i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture it came wrinkled but i think even pressed it would fall weird the side swoop falls funny and you can see the seams underneath and the top front falls funny not quite sure what to do with it it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down again maybe if you get it pressed that would be better the back is still beautiful though im   ordered a   maybe on someone talle
love this fits great warm and soft would recommend
"this is a really unique floreat top unfortunately the petite sizes sold out so i went with an xs this was too bigtoo wide in the shoulders and chest all around actually my other issue is that its a heavy material i just feel like if i was wearing it around all day i might burn up in it it did not feel like it was breathable and finally im  the xs was too long in the back i could see how this could look really cool on the right personim just not that person to pull it"

denim faux fur flannel hooray i absolutely love this jacket and ill wear it all winter even under my warmer winter coat im  and usually a  in retailer and the small in this coat was plenty big in the waistchest and even had room underneath to add a second shirt or light sweater it seems a little shorter on me than in the photo maybe thats the only drawback
this tunic has really cute detail it is hard to see in online photos but there is dark brownish beading over the embroidery the fabric is not as soft as i would have liked but its still a keeper because of the two patterns embroidery and beading also it is long and does run large but i think the measurements given in the description are accurate it is a tunic after all i ordered an xs petite and it will be very cute with leggings and boots
the lace front is more detailed than i expected but in a good way the sleeves are softer on the outside but the inside is not too scratchy as others have said in my opinion it is comfy but i feel that the lace part is fragile and i will need to be mindful of where im sitting when wearing it not a deal breaker though

im not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddlyboxy the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms im usually a pretty solid size medium but i think im going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall but if that doesnt solve the trick if not recommend bc that side puffiness isnt flattering

i bought this blouse with the  off price i dont think i would pay full price for it but for the sale price i think its fair  as the other reviewers have said its definitely navy in front not black but its a nice color combination and can be worn with dark jeans or with black pants for a more casual work look  its sheer but a dark cami underneath fixes the problem  i think it fits true to size with the understanding that its supposed to be flowy and loose

it is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordinglythis does not run smallthis is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with womens apparel sizing i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for mevery small
"no lycra in this skirt says my label ignore the website description its  cotton so no stretchme  waist and  hips the medium is a snug fit on my true waist i love it and will be tucking in shirts  tees when i wear it otherwise it seems true to the pictures dark and long the slit opens above my knees im the pockets are in a kind of odd position in the very front but the trick of that is they add no bulk to hips soits a win"
this jumpsuit is absolutely beautiful it fit like a glove and made me feel incredibly classy and sexy at the same time i am  and  and the  fit like a glove and right at my ankles and above my elbows the  fit a bit more loose and below my ankles and right at my elbows it is so different and easy to wear
this is a beautiful dress the dress is a lighter blue when compared to the picture and the fabric is thick but the shape is beautiful the waist is very fitted but it didnt feel uncomfortable i didnt think the fabric was itchy as others mentioned i do think it is a bit short on the front it is a high low dress but at  that is not a problem for me it was true to size for me  lbs

its a cozy sweater that doesnt make me feel frumpy still stylish and its not too heavy but still warm enough its like wearing a blanket sort of definitely sheer with the big loom wear a camisole under it i got compliments the first day i wore it
"i bought this sweater on a whim in the store without trying it on when i got home i decided it would probably lose its shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it a few days later desperate for something to wear i grabbed it and decided to keep it  merely to have something to wear that day im so glad i didthis is a great sweater layered with a cami it looks fantastic it does not lose its shape or grow it is structured so it doesnt feel sloppy it has w"
doesnt feel like cotton jersey feels like a thin version of the seamless cami its not soft as i expected its much thinner than expected too
soft and comfy without being too thick or too warm flattering cut quality material and construction fully opaque so no showthough true to size im   lbs my usual size small is perfect could not improve upon these joggers love love love
i loved this shirt flattering and pretty its hand wash only or dry clean i hand washed it and the blue tshirt part of the shirt shrank and now the front of the shirt is too short for me would not recommend due to shrinkage too bad
id been eyeing this dress for a while wondering if it could work for me i wound up ordering the sp size when it went on sale its pretty perfecti am  and currently  lbs it fits well if a touch loose in the waist but i think if i had purchased the xsp it might be too snug through the bust as its fairly fitted there the neckline comes a little lower than i usually wear which is part of why i wanted to order the petite size rather than the regular that and the length but i can
i first saw this shirt on one of the workers at the retailer stores and it looked beautiful i loved it so much i had to order it when it came on sale the fit is a little too short for my liking but i think i can make it work also it does fit a little snug around the arms but it at least it doesnt show your undergarments overall i think it is absolutely beautiful the fabric has a beautiful shimmer to it and it looks easy to dress up for a day at the office or a night on the town or paired

i am mad for plaidthis dress is my new favorite why ill tell you the picture online does not do it justice but you must add a belt the dress is cut lower in the front but has a great stitch to keep it from gaping open over my d cup chest the material is soft and breathable the xsp was perfect for my  frame my typical size
"such an adorable and comfortable dress just love the fit the design and the comfort of the denim fabric its quite flattering fits true to size and i cant wait to wear it to casual parties all summer long highly recommend lots ofoptions too with dressing it up a bit more with fun high healed sandals or a pretty shrug and just as nice to wear with flip flops or keds i  and usually a size  and it fit true to sizegrab it while you still can"
i have been unable to find a jumpsuit that looks good likely due to my long torso this is the first one that doesnt make me look like i am a tall fiveyearold easy to dress it up with a statement necklace and fits perfectly i am   pds and bought my normal xs highly recommend especially with the current extra  off promotion
i agree with the other reviewers about the versatility and the fit of the dress i am  and yes the pockets hit just a tad high but the fit of the bodice and bust is so great that i am willing to overlook this small flaw the only thing that has really bothered me about the dress that i havent seen anyone else comment on is the slightly strange odor from the denim maybe it just happens to be my particular dress but i have noticed this strange smell from a pair of seven jeans i had purcha
i loved this dress the second i saw it in the catalog and had to have it i had been looking for a plaid dress for awhile but couldnt find anything that i fell in love with till this one i love the front of the dress and the asymmetrical details its just beautiful my only complaint would be that the back of the dress is pretty blah after all the awesome going on in front i was disappointed in the view from behind but i still love this dress and will be keeping it and wearing it for a lon
im a sucker for plaid i tried another plaid shirtdress from retailer and it looked like a housecoat on me this is lovely  a bit fitted but very relaxed and casual ill be able to dress it up for casual days at work its got enough lovely details to be stylish i think the waist looks a bit simple so a belt helps dress it up the sleeves finish with a button so it looks polished or they can be rolled up i love it with booties
i love the pattern and colors of this dress the quality of the fabric is great i initially ordered my usual size xs but found it a bit roomy so i ordered both an xsp and an xxs the xxs was more fitted and the xsp was too short in my opinion i am still on the fence about the xs and the xxs the xxs has a tighter fit but it is also tight in the bust and i wonder how it will be if i have to reach for something  will it be too tight even though the xs runs slightly big i can still work with
every single time i was in a store this dress caught my eye there was never a large or xl to try on however so when a free shipping offer came up i took a chance and ordered both the xl was too large the large was much better but a little snug so if it shrunk i would have been out of luck if i would have kept one it would have been the large however they are both going back a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger but on a body it is
the dress is wellstructured and refined enough to wear with a cardigan to work on casual fridays but fun enough to wear on its own to a summer festival because of the length i would suggest wearing with heels as it hits below the knee i would suggest a size down especially if you are smallerbusted

amazing beautiful dress that is very slimming and elegant while casual but it is only for smaller busted women i have a medium and am a   its tight and pulls strangely ive seen that comment elsewhere i tried on the large and it was too big everywhere but the bust
i had my eye on this dress since it fist came out but hesitated to order due to some of the lower reviews when i got a chance to try it on  i loved it i did go up a size i am  so i had it shortened to above the knee i didnt mind losing the unfinished hem  had the hem match that of the pockets i am a  but the bodice is stable and even if i pull at it it stays put so happy to find this especially on sale i plan to wear it at our company party which is help on a large charter bo
like some other reviewers i too have to comment on the dresss fit the dress doesnt fit right around the bust or the waist as a seamstress myself i know that the problem is that it doesnt have any darts in the bust and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right while a belt helps i dont think it helps enough to justify the price its too badi think the concept of it is cool and i was rea

i need to start by saying im   i think thats why i love this dress so much its not too short on me like so many it is a classic fit that is flattering on me the raw edge detail makes it a little more fun then just a strapless denim dress and the pockets are the best i love dresses with pockets they dont stick out weird or anything either the only negative which prevents the perfect  star review is the bottom is fuller than i would like aline is a little misleading its defini
these are truly slouchy leggings i am short  so they do bunch quite a bit for me but when paired with a long chunky sweater they are perfect unlike the other review i felt that they ran a little on the larger side i am typically an  and ordered the ml they sit nicely on my lower waist and do not sag but the length is long long long i recommend these for wearing out or around the house
"i got these in the neutral color  quickly understood why theyre categorized as loungewear if youre going to wear them out of the house wear a tunic or a dress over them i folded the scrunch part up over my calves  wore them like boot socks when i went out i got a ml  they fit about on par with other leggings  tights of that size rangewhen i got home i rolled them down  put the bottoms over my heels the rest of the bottoms scrunched around my ankles i recommend them for around"
this has a nice vintage cut and soft feel with the metal detailing of a blinded out rock n roll tee its perfect with jeans a leather skirt or even lounge pants its a great top to throw in an overnight bag for a weekend away because its so versatile
on the advice of other reviewers i purchased the ml in this item boy was i happy i did i am normally a size  and because of the sheerness issue mentioned by another reviewer i purchased the larger size they are still sheer in the rear end you must wear a tunic or longer shirtskirt with these if you are hanging around the house it is not too bad these are very comfortable and feel great while wearing the color is great and the look is good they are really long when you remove them fr
this top is very feminie i love hte pelats and flower details it can be however a bit boxy i think if you have wider hips i might avoid great to go with skinny pantsejans though could size down if shoulders are not too wide
"this appears much more pink in person im not really a pink girl but thought id try the way the shoulders are cut makes my defined shouldersarms look too intense for my liking this would look nicer on someone more petite and less athletic in my opinion i like that the bust has slight padding that can make a bra unnecessary for yoga spin pilates ballet or barre class its nice and fitted and true to size would be really cute on the right person"
the simplicity of this tshirt will go with jeans shorts or anything casual the macrame and bead details give it that extra style i bought the red and white and love them both the red is warm and bright with pink undertones despite the boxiness of the fit it ran true to size for me i did not think it was too big its meant to be loose and slouchy rather than fitted
i read the other review that said the shirt was boxy i didnt think it would be a terribly big deal unfortunately it is normally i wear a size s so i sized down o an xs the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline but the shirt is still very box and now super short unfortunately this is going back not a good fit adorable details but the fit is terrible
im   and im usually a smallmedium depending on the vendor i bought this shirt in a red medium and love it yes its boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think its meant to be a bit big ive worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it this shirt washes well per instructions didnt shrink or loose its shape and ive washed it three times now ive had many compliments on how cute this shirt is love
i saw this dress online and thought it looked just ok i happened to see the dress in my retailer store today and thought i would try it im so glad i did this dress looks so much better on im usually a  in dresses at retailer i tried this in a large it fit perfect its doesnt cling to you but it doesnt hang like a sack either i think it made me look taller and thin woohoo i would say its a little on the thinner side its not a heavy knit its two layers of thinner knit  as yo
"wearing this dress for the first time now and i love it soft material comfortable and easy to dress up or dress down making it good for all kinds of different occasionsi was a bit nervous about the initial purchase due to other reviews saying this dress isnt great for pear shapes but i wholeheartedly disagree i think it actually just needs a belt for those of us with particularly curvy figures  im wearing a belt around my natural waist and have bloused out the top and it looks g"
i bought my typical size xs and it fits perfectly its loose but not overly baggy which is what i was looking for the material seems very durable my concern with all white tops is being too thin and see through and that was not the case with this shirt the front comes right above my crotch and the back covers my cushion ive only worn it once and that was with some bootcut jeans booties simple earrings and a statement necklace i highly recommend it
"a little long still but loved the fitflattering on me i have thighs and these balanced out the thigh effect color wash was also very nice in my opinion can be wrn with any top really i had to make myself return them jsut coz of price but on my wish list for sure"
i was really excited about this dress i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece casual or dress up when it arrived in the mail the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress unfortunately it hung like that too the material sags in places it shouldnt i have a   lb frame and i ordered an extra small and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back
i thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod this one didnt work for me i ordered the medium the top is very smalli would recommend only for b cup or smaller the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter sending this one back i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit
this suit is super cute i think it will be too short in the body for taller girls i am   pounds  and bought the medium very cute fit but its almost slightly too short in the body maybe if you are smaller on top you will get more length in the body i really want to keep this suit i might consider the large but the rest of the suit fits perfect
this shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free i also love that its the perfect weight and not too low cut and that the buttons are covered however the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it i didnt even wash the shirt yet sadly i dont think i can recommend this shirt though maybe give it a try i might have got a defective one oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body but it still looks great i hope this helps

thanks for the tip to size down i am typically a m or a l  and i sized down to a s it is perfectly structured and warm and soft and beautiful got it on the  percent of sale items so the price was right absolutely a classic i got the plum color thanks retailer for another wardrobe staple
love these charlies the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too i ordered one size up mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter like usual and the description said slim fit i went from a  to an  and the  werent big at all so they might run a tad on the small side side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband but i dont think that can be prevented
beautiful fallwinter piece so soft and comfy was unsure about it when i saw it online but once i saw it in store and got to try it on and feel it i could not put it down i felt you could definitely size down
"i love most pure and good clothing pieces mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials this tunic does deliver on both counts but i is very very long and straight up and downfyi i have a boyish figure having no waisthips i have a broad shoulderback so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesnt really flatter my body it would be okay for just haging around the house but i wouldnt feel comfortable wearing this tunic out"
love this bra i was looking for something feminine and sexy and this is perfect its exactly as pictured i was worried the material would be too delicate and fragile but its really durable my only issue is that it fits a tiny bit awkwardly because of the solid material on the side but it doesnt actually look awkward just feels a bit odd at first i highly recommend it if youre looking for something sweet and sexy
i love charlie pants ive bought a few in the past and ive never been disappointed with quality style or fit i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result i wish more pants were side zip so much more flattering than having that part stick out under fitted shirts i got these in a  my usual size and while they fit a little more snugly than my other size  charlie pants there is enough stretch that they dont look or feel too tight i also got these in the regular r
really comfortable dress to wear  pretty flower design  good fabric and ribbon details are well placed thankful it came with a cotton under slip because its very sheer fabric and i didnt have to think of  what to put underneath  have worn it twice since it shipped and im really happy with my purchase  online order and shipment was super fast too
morher jeans are my favourite they are soft and fit great make my saggy butt look good they do stretch with wears but shrink again in the wash they do shrink quite a bit so dont dry all the way i recommend mother to all
i really like this dress despite the somewhat gathered skirt it has a clean line and doesnt add a lot of volume around the hips the blue is a great color the length is well above the knee but im  i can see wearing this dress in the fall with leggings or tights and boots
tried this on on a whim and so glad i did it is lovely i cant wait for next summer now as ill definitely wear this as a dress with a light cardigan seems tts  and  i bought in a small and it fits nicely a bit pricey for what it is  or  would have been more appropriate i think so try to get it on sale 
i bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months its so soft and cozy im tempted to keep it i got the xss regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist belly button and ive got a shorter torso and am  i got this during the  sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night more of a cab to curb piece
what s lovely surprise this jacketcapeponcho is  first it is a substantial piece  heavier than it appears  it has an almost faux suede feel to it with a deliciously lush french terry lining  it looks and feels very rich  i bought both colors and was glad i did  i live on the coast and this will be fantastic over a sweater for morning walks along the shore  im a lxl and the ml size is a perfect fit
i loved the color and the neckline was flattering however it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am  and a  it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long also didnt think the fabric was good quality for this price
this cardigan is very soft and feminine it looks nice on but it sheds everywhere i decided to pass on it when it got white fur all over the other clothes in the fitting room if you dont mind the shedding then i would recommend this sweater

this arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online im a curvy gal so i honestly wasnt feeling like this would look good on me but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to itlike it would be rainproof the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion even cuter than the blue side the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj

as soon as i tried on this cardigan i knew i had to have it it takes your outfit to a glam and high end look the fabric is oh so soft and i loved how it draped the sleeves hang low and give you a vintage feel i would give this a  star rating however the downside to this cardigan is the shedding it shed all over my black pants when i wore it and on my friends too  i really went back and forth on returning this but i think its so beautiful i am keeping it i am hoping over time the sh

i saw this in the store and loved the feel of the fabric but did not want to pay full price i was very happy when it went on sale the top clings nicely without feeling tight i got sp   i worried the neckline would slip off fits perfectly fabric has a very slight sheen i just hope it holds up to washing and caution is needed as you may create pulls with jewelry if careless
i ordered the xl in the green motif the shirt is fitted through the body im a pearshape so its tight around my hips its cut straight down ill need to wear this tucked in or belt itpull it up a bit closer to my waistline so its more comfortable the colors  pattern in the green motif are prettier in person i love orange roses  havent found any shirt or dress with orange roses before so i kept it i used my birthday discount to splurge on this i think its overpriced for what it i
the material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves i would buy in a minute we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining now the cons i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look it runs short and i cant imagine who thought this design was a good idea there were no reviews when i ordered i am learning to try it on in the store andor read the reviews before investing i would say go up a
this sweater is pretty fits tts feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed i particularly like the buttons on the side you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures i think this shade of gray is also appealing to me as its not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think

absolutely love this in blue the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape the colors and pattern are accurate on screen  vibrant and rich the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy very happy with this purchase
"i tried the regular szie in store like the cut need petite though too long and a lot of fabric  i am  and  color unfortunatly looke aweful on my skin tone and washed me out would need to be more red the striping washed out the color nad dindt look flattering on me the cut did howeverso if you ahge a good hur to your skin good dress for you if you are palelike me i dont recommendps love hte tie waist picture not asflattering as on person"
i rarely write reviews but this one deserves one this top is completely utterly adorable it flows so beautifully which makes it perfect to wear with leggingsskinny jeans i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party and i received so many compliments this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty i love the maeve brand and this is certainly no exception id love to get it in multiple colors
i really loved the material and the feel of this item however it does run very large even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings
this dress is really gorgeous really fun and beautifully made im typically an     so i got this in an  and it was huge on me there was so much extra room in the chest and the back and it was much too long for me even if i sized down it feels a little age inappropriate for me im  and it felt very conservative and unflattering  i think this dress is excellent just not for me
this blouse combines two things i love  swing tops and bows just received this and am very pleased the blue version is very pretty i recently purchased another top by the same brand and ordered a  for this i ordered a small and am glad i did i would suggest ordering your regular size the top is fitted the bottom is very fluid
okso after reading the other reviews im sad to say i rated this as runs small only because i usually buy one or two sizes smaller in maeve than i settled on with this dress its actually an adorable dress but im sure you have to have the right figure i dont think any one woman has the same figure as another and this dress is made for someone with a very definite hourglass figure i have a large chest a moderate middle and large hips i really loved both sizes but i chose to size up b
i loved the print on this top in navy from the picture and loved it even more in person it is gorgeous and the top feels high quality that said as usual with maeve clothing it fit me strangely i am curvy with a small upper body  d but larger bust and maeve tops are almost always too tight in the bust and too flowy around the middle  which creates a pregnant look on me at least i feel their fit model must be small busted so for small busted ladies this top would be lovely i always
this dress is the opitome of summer day or night running errands during the day to a casual night out this dress will be that go to favorite i feel it runs small on the top i am large busted and i sized up for this reason and it still could be roomieri wear a size  on top and for referance i got the  i will keep it as it is not uncomfortable but for a drees that lends to a drape on top i wish they would have made it roomierimhave never had this issue with mauve as it is one of my
i really liked this dress online and i loved it in person the print is different the waist is synched skirt is full has a very feminine shape definitely a special piece runs large im usually a  in dresses and an  in skirts im    and then  was noticeably too big size  fit perfect and im no size  no sleeves will make if easy to add a denim jacket or a cardigan it hits approx  above the knees but has a conservative high neckline and back is covered good quali
i tried this dress on in the store prepared to buy this lovely piece i feel that it should have been a few inches longer it would look more proportionate next the tie is really difficult to place but it creates some great detail to the front and back it wrinkles easily i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear lastly it is not lined what a bummer at least the skirt could be lined but it does have pockets that is sweet
i am so crazy about this dress i got it in the mail today and just love it  no its not lined but its not see through so no big deal i was afraid the tie would add bulk but i look very thin i just need to call for a price adjustment since i payed full price
i read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great first of all i am   lbs athletic build not skinny but have muscles the sweater fits great just like glove it does not make me look fat the quality is greatsweater is warm cozy and wellmade i am not sure about color as its brighter as it shown it is not quite coral its a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind th sw
this dress is so soft and fits like a dream im a new mom and the tie perfectly masks whats left of my mummy tummy while still helping me feel stylish for fall
perfect easy  effortlessly beautiful design and just my favorite pajama ever im not my ideal weight right now and these make me feel attractive againlove
got charlie trousers last year in a different print in my usual size    they initially fit perfectly but stretched out in the thighs and waist and now are loose  this time i bought a size smaller size  they were snug but i felt them stretch during the first wear and they fit fine now  i recommend sizing down because they stretch out love the print for summer i love anything beachy and had to have it  nice comfortable material which isnt hot for summer  got the regular si
in the quest to find comfy cute casual tops i took a change on this one its cute but quite oversized it just overwhelmed me i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model the style and color just didnt suit my coloring or body type  but i still recommend because its comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone elses closet
the design of this sweater is odd it made me feel very round when i put it on the sleeves were wide the other reviewers were correct in saying that its a thick sweater which i thought id like the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater
i wore these with high heels to a formal gathering i received many compliments perfect for summer you can dress them up with heels or wear flats or sandals and be casual i have a pear shape so i think they fit best for my body type love them
ive been buying pilcro for years they are good quality comfortable and wear well my only complaint is and this a general complaint of all pants today is that these are cropped i have a  inseam these stop well above my ankle but i love the color and the general fit im used to having most of my pants even those labelled tall be too short so i dont mind it too much i feel as though it runs a little big due to how much stretching that happens as you wear them its pretty much a tra

"lovely sweater good quality fabric pretty color as the reviewer say it is very thick wool pile if warm is not what youre looking for you may want to think twice"
"this  aprã¨sski style sweater is made of an amazingly soft pure wool in a color that is a touch brighter and maybe even a bit more coral pink than the online photo looks to me there is a large button under the collar that shows if you stand it up seems to be of a very high quality comparable to vintage handknit sweatersit is very chunky and warm and i would recommend taking a size up for a looser fit im   narrow shoulders and otth the xs and s fit me well running"
this simple dress will turn heads it fits to the body hugging just in the right spots i love this dress it is soft and feels amazing on you can adjust the tie in the front i purchased the copper color but i have to say that is much more brown to me than copper a dark brown i still think the dress is adorable looks cute with booties or knee high boots winner
i have been searching for these pants my whole life i have them in several colors i wear the moss most often id recommend your normal size or size down if in between sizes they stretch a bit as you wear them one other thing after being washed and dried the color has lightened significantly
i love this flattering and comfortable jacket it has a nice stretch and the color is out of this world i think it will pack a big punch this fall
i got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i dont think it was a case of it being too small i guess it just wasnt reinforced enough there was also a missstitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily lastly theres a slip on the inside which i dont think was necessary it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy

soft very thin material perfect for summer but very difficult to wear without a bra because it is so thin it shows quite a bit the chest is tight but you can adjust the fit by the neck tie looks exactly like on the model but the cut made me feel wide had to take it back
i love the feminine feel and look of this skirt it is unique and matches many different shirts and looks great with a jacket the only thing is it does run large i ordered a  my usual size and it is very loose not form fitting like the photo but still cute and wearable downsizing wouldve been better
the print and fabric are great but this dress has odd construction or maybe i have an odd construction anyway im  weigh   i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms  but the issue was in the hips im somewhere between athletic and curvy the skirt looks more aline in the photo but its actually cut pretty straight spanx would have helped but im not about to wear spanx all day in a workcasual dress i think a medium would make the top too big so i
i bought these in light grey and navy they are both beautiful high qualityvery flattering and so comfortable i love them theyre a perfect long length i have long legs and it can be challenging finding a good length in pants the pockets are deep and functional which is rare in womens pants they are more than i like to spend but i will get a lot of wear out of them they look and feel fantastic i highly recommend these

it jacket of the season this bomber is absolutely perfect not only is the embroidery beautiful but its super comfy as well its lightweight nicely lined and well made i only gave it four stars for quality simply because the embroidery could get pulled and frayed if not careful you should expect that with any silky embroidered fabric however  i would highly recommend this jacket for any body type
tried on standard xs and the photo online is slightly misleading as i thought that there were more colors involved in the embroidery pattern in person the pattern is not as intricate with only  solid colors the body of the shirt is light airybillowy not as form grazing like on the modelwhich i dont mind i still love the top but would have to go for a petite xs or even a petite xxs so that it would be a little more fitted all around note that the embroidery on the dã©colletã© feels lik
this dress intrigued me a bit online but not enough to order it to try it even on the rack i wasnt so sure about it but decided to try it this afternoon i couldnt have been more pleased it is fresh flattering flowy light and beautiful even though there is quite a bit of fabric the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering i didnt realize this came in blue as well i may add that one to my wishlist but the red one is a definite winner it will make a great
the skirt is not as form fitting as i had hoped it is a lot of material that is flowy and billowy not straight and pencillike as shown as in the pictures the material and design is just okay not super wowed by it i did size down but feel like i might need to size down even more to get more of a fitted look
love the subtle pattern i think it will be great for a number of occasions the fit is very flattering not lined but high quality heavyweight fabric does not seem to make it necessary
the material is beautiful and as others said its a bit fuller than one might think i am returning because its high waisted with a thick elastic waist band not my style  i suppose it would work with a thick belt as i said its beautiful  just not my style
i was a little hesitant about sizing based on reviewsbut my normal small fit perfectly it is a little low cut for workbut with a scarf will be fine i wish it was a bit shorter hits just below the knees on mebut overall great i have a fairly straight body type and think dress probably works best on this type although if you were small on top and curvy on bottom i think this could be cute too for the price point with the sale its definitely worth trying i got the black and whiteand i

this fit me perfectly with a little room but think its meant to be this way so easier to get on and off this feels like a dream and is very good quality definitely a heavier piece but i like that it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy the back is adorable too retailer hit it out of park with this one grab it before its too late im a  and size  and the large fit perfectly
i love this dress ive received compliments from everyone its long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school  and its beautiful
this is the perfect warm cozy boho sweater the blue trim really stands out and brightens up the grey this sweater will look cute over any outfit or with jeans i have long arms and the sleeves almost cover my hands which i really like i highly recommend this especially at  off
i originally bought this in a medium for reference  i am   lbs it was tiny i sent it back for a large and it fits beautifully the fabric is incredibly soft and the dress is very flattering and comfortable i would just recommend ordering up a size
ive never owned a romper and never had any desire to but the classy design in black soft flowy fabric reeled me in prompting me to push my boundaries a bit im so glad i did i dont think i have any other piece of clothing that makes me feel so classy or so fun and certainly not at the same time i wear it to work in an office environment with a cardigan and the cardigan goes off after work as i run errands or play with the kids i love it and it even has pockets  im a sucker for

lightweight airy silk its not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk it looks somewhat cheap the silk doesnt feel smooth to the touch it has a slight roughness to it it would have been nicer if they had used thicker higher quality silk the waist has a tight wide elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable the color of the skirt is true to the photos i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it
i think im on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to fit because i love this dress it may be because i dont have much hips or curve to my waist that this dress is not tight as it is on others it does make me look like i have some shape down there because it doesnt cling i ordered the holly green and i adore the shoulder detail confused as to why that same detail follows along around the inside of the dress across the shoulders because it itches a little i do have to wear a cami
"i loved this classic bomber jacket online and in the brochure sent to my house so i was thrilled to see it in my local retailer store i anticipated that i would need a large but i was wrong the m fits perfectly fyi  broad shouldersback short waist size  in buttonup or fitted topsand dresses usually  and a m in a loosefit or knit topthe m fits me just like the model in the photo so i would think that you are between sizes like i usually am you should size down the z"
"these corduroys are perfect the flare is just enough to be current without seeming overly trendy or costumey they make my legs look super long and look great with a professional top or my favorite with a drapery tshirt half tuckedthey are pretty long im  with pretty long legs and i could use a  hem which shouldnt affect the style much until then im wearing them with a  inch platform and theyre perfect highly recommend if they still had my size in other colors in stock i wo"
im always on the lookout for those special clothing items that add pizzazz to my wardrobe this is one i had been looking for a bomber jacket and tried many but this one falls elegantly and is really beautiful i cant wait to show it off
i ordered this after seeing the rave reviews it is not for me just like the culottes i ordered this romper makes me feel like a grandma i said id recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again this was not for me i also didnt like the back of the romper no way i could even get away with a racerback bra bc its so low cut the good though it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric tts also im a med  and the medium was correct in this

the shorts have a linen look but have just a touch of stretch to them which is great for keeping their shape im   and the shorts hit about  down my thigh which is just long enough to cover but still sexy the  fit but snug all over the  gave a looser look but still fit in the waist i have the navy and the mango definitely recommend
i finally visited a store with petite and this dress was there so of course i snagged it to try on i love the colors i mean awesome the fabric is also very soft but the cut was just huh on me nothing to go raving about i think it would be nice for a casual day but i often just wear joggers or yoga pants on casual days so for the price i left it
i got size  and they dont fit me as ankle they fit me as long skinnies but the quality is so good theyre smooth and stretchy but they feel thick enough that when you pull them on you can tell its quality denim a great pant buy if youre looking for soft as butter grey jeans
lovely dress but i would recommend ordering a size smaller than you normally do
i ordered this dress on a whim because of the  off on mothers day weekend and i am so glad i did this dress is very flattering i have a hard time finding dresses that are a little loose but dont make me look fat this dress has just the right cut i recommend it for anyone who likes something not to tight but also flattering
i absolutely love this dress the color is beautiful the fit is flattering and it is so comfy i didnt want to take it off until bedtime it is an all around winner if i could do one thing to make it absolutely perfect i would take and inch or two off the hem i am think of doing that but seriously i am not sure i want to have it out in alterations when i could be wearing it it is just too comfy and cute
these do run small for pilcro which i think runs large overall after reading other reviews i decided to get the size i would order in ag or coh and the like thanks fellow reviewers because im pleased when i first put them on i said no the waist was a tad big but comfy and the legs seemed tight with the slits at the bottom going right to my ankle  inch inseam i thought these looked ridiculous however once i had them on for about  minutes they just sort of molded to my body and loo
"i purchased this dress on a whim it is easy to wear and very comfortable  the empire waist is flattering however the dress runs large and the lower half is aline the neckline is very flattering and you feel put together when wearing this dressi am happy to have it in my wardrobe a goto piece for years to come"
great dress comfortable to wear and flattering with the stretch cinch waist and the soft flare of the skirt i feel flirty and fun with its open scoop neck and dipping back plenty of space and simplicity to accessorize or not i bought it in blackwhite and red each with its own feel

these are comfy and cool i got the blue which is more royal than navy in opinion it goes well with almost anything i can wear all the neutral colors in addition to orange red yellow and patterns they are flattering and like other reviewers i went up a size to  in the blue perfect length not too short got the same version last year in white

i am obsessed with these shorts i bought blue ones last year and loved them so much i needed another pair i purchased the gray ones and they are a beautiful hue even with my pale legs i think they will be very versatile the fit is perfect hits at just the right length to be flattering and appropriate not too short super comfy i am fuller on the bottom so shorts are tough to find and these are truly amazing i cant wait to wear them when it gets warmer for reference i am   about
this top is so cute a little cropped light for a sweater tank in my opinion and runs a little big so i sized down one size beautiful fabric and fit the ruffles are such a fun addition definitely recommend with a high waisted pant or skirt for work  so cute

i ordered both colors in xxs xs p and xxs p were both sold out at the time sale came on verdict fits really nicely but short i would have to wear this with higher rise pants or pencil skirt like the red one is pictures with a polka dot skirt i decided to keep the red one because it is a bot more unique i do have a few navy tops the xxs fits fitted cant think of another way of saying it so i like it as it will go nicely with looser bottoms i love the sleeves the ruffles make t
i ordered the green version in size xl i knew it was cropped and it fits me as shown on the models so i think thats true to size the knit is very soft but its the color thats amazingsuch a rich bright emerald green i love the look of it its awkward fitting on my pearshape i layer a long tank underneath with this on top but the hemline of the sweater cuts at an unflattering place still the softness and the beautiful color make it a staple in my closet when im staying at home
i love this sweater i was nervous after reading the reviews but ordered it anyway and im so glad i did i got it in grey the tie backvback feature is my favorite part flirty and feminine unique but also subtle i dont think the material is scratchy it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts but i wouldnt call it scratchy it was perfectly comfortable to me i will say that its a little short though i vary between a m and l depending on the shirt  long torso 
"i really like this sweater it is surprisingly warm it is not very form fitting which can slenderize but i enjoy layering with a lacy tank and dont have to worry about sucking in the guy either  im   and typically wear between a  the medium was definitely baggy i ended up with a small in  colorsoh and the bow detail really does add a fanciness to an otherwise comfysnuggle sweater"
i have a curvy figure and have always loved the way pilcro jeans have fit aka plenty of stretch for butt and thighs and small waist i was really excited to try their skinny  high waisted version first i dont like the faux whiskering on the jeans i think it makes them look cheap second the fabric had more stretch than im use to for pilcro denim and made them feel low quality  i dont think they are terrible i just think i should have been more careful about reading the percentages of

i just bought this shirt last week in stores and i love it it looks different on me i bought an xs though im   not typically an xs though im pretty small on top its  sleeves on me and tight at my forarms i love it it so cute and you cant see in the picture but the design has a tiny bit of shimmer the detail is cut out but not really see though so i dont feel like i have to wear a tank or anything under it as long as i wear a nude bra did i mention i love it i hope i
i pair this jacket with a black pencil skirt and it looks very put together the embroidery is lovely and well done but the jacket would have been nicer with a polyester lining because it clings a little when you put it on and its an awfully heavy jacket for the summer but overall i love it and how i look in it  i think it runs true to size
"wow i got this top in blue and im in love love the whole off the shoulder trend and this does not disappoint i sized a bit down  usually get a  and i got a  since it fits a bit snug and the back shows the fau tank in the bank i find it really classy like your ontrend but not trying to bare too much skin i think it could even be worn in a professional setting because of that its very upscale looking in the navy would totally buy different colors if it came in others but im no"
"i found these jeans to be more fitted than slouchy for reference im  and  im heavier thru the hips and thighs and ordered both the    petite i usually take  p in pilcro and the  fit well but was by no means slouchy however still very flattering and unique i had purchased the other pilcro em in  p and they did fit looser and i would also recommend that style always count on pilcro for great fit and style"
love the crochet detail on the back yes it does show the bottom band of your bra i think im okay with that i had on a magenta colored bra when i tried this on and it was a nice pop of color i think the top runs tts to slightly big if youre in between sizes i would go down i am a  and i ordered a size  so i havent tried on the  but i think it would fit too and not be quite as loose in the arm hole area im sure this top will sell out before it hits sale

a really beautiful well made dress runs extremely big though im not petite by any means and ordered a large but im positively swimming in it an oversized look works for this particular dress but i think its supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style

okay this is the cutest sleep jumper ive ever owned its soft and cozy and even a tiny bit sexy i give it  stars because its a little on the thin side not sheer but close really fun little piece definitely recommend
"i think you have to have stick legslegs for days for this style to fit as pictured i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed the color is slightly brighter than the picture which is fine though i was digging the slightly greyed lookanyway these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else i have a fairly athletic build so its not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs"
while the dress is pretty its a lot more boring than it seems online the box top is actually a completely separate piece which is kind of neat  you can choose to remove it or not the box top is very wide much wider than on the model and very unflattering also the dress is a stiff silk fabric and doesnt flow like you would think it would returning it
i think i ordered this in an xxs because of the other reviews making it sound like it ran large and im happy with the size and overall look of this tee on me im  about  lbs and  i generally order xs or xspetite the cuffs of the sleeves are pretty tight and the vneck is higher than id like but otherwise i really like the loose casual fit theres no armhole seam theyre dolman sleeves the tee i got translates to the beautiful coast it does say made in usa on the label a
i had my eyes on this top ever since i saw it online i couldnt be happier with it it is very comfortable flattering and unique i think it will wear well into the fall with black skinnies
"boxy unflattering and largeim  and a curvy  pounds this top size s swallowed me had no shape and the material didnt feel great either i wouldnt even purchase it on salethere are other graphic tees that are much nicer ill be sticking to splendid and sundry"
the ivory color needs a little camisole or tank underneath the sweater is beautifully knit and has a soft and nubby texture hope it washes well maybe size up if you want a looser relaxed feel hits me right around the hip bone and i am   can easily be dressed up or down with accessories
gorgeous pattern even prettier in person runs slightly large in my opinion could size down nice to have as a petite option
this is a gorgeous dress the print is beautiful and unique however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames i would definitely recommend sizing down
i love this jacket i was hesitant to order but im so glad i did its such a cute unique blazer to add to my wardrobe fit is very true to size for a blazer
i was in search of a few sweaters that were functional for the winter but also fit my style i will have to wear a camisole underneath but i love the feel and the fit i always have a problem finding sleeves that are long enough the sleeves are an appropriate length
i tried this on in the store in the xs size the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall having said that i did not buy it and probably wont unless i find it on the sale rack later it is really more of a poncho than a sweater the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall i would only wear it with a shirt underneath the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder but start further do
the dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well if you are going to try it probably size down  sizes for reference im  and  lbs i bought my normal size  and it was very large i would not recommend as its just not flattering i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as im an retailer devotee
i really like this top the material is thicker than i thought which is a good thing it fits me very well and is very comfortable i definitely recommend this shirt
"this dress is quite lovely in person but it runs very small particularly in the bust im usually okay with a large in retailer dresses sometimes medium but i had a hard time getting into this and the top was literally about  from being able to zip up granted i have a larger than average bust but thats still excessive and the fabric has no give whatsoeverthe online pictures are pretty accurate representations in terms of look and shape i think it would probably be best for pear s"
ive had my eye on this cute knit top for awhile and when there was a sale i picked up both colors they fit me like they do the model a little loose and swingy but not overly so the colors look spoton like the picture i am rather top heavy  but with the colors being darker on the top portion i feel like this works without accentuating my bust too much i am  and weigh  the medium worked out great the knit is soft and it appears to be made well the only drawback is a rough
i do recommend this dress with some caveats  itll be difficult to find a bra that wont show straps and  its very figure flattering so if youre body conscious particularly tummy
although the dress is heavy like other reviews mentioned it is sturdy enough to not be see through and the material is extremely soft i am currently an xs or small in nearly all retailer clothing however a d cup bra i think that if you are a smaller person the dress may be too much to carry but for those of us that find it is sometimes hard to get a great fit on top and still fitted through the waist it is perfect many compliments  the hem is so funalso other reviews mentioned the bow
lets begin with the fabricits heavy but not in a burdensome way as soon as you put it on you feel like you have a quality piece of clothing on next aestheticsthis dress is flowy and feminine and a bonus it made me look bustier than i am perhaps because of the stripes i didnt find myself pulling this dress up all the time once i put it on it stayed in place perfectly bottom line this dress goes from dressy to casual without a second thought and its on salegrab this one
"cute dress but way too big i ordered a  petite and im swimming in it im usually a size  and will exchange for smaller size since i think it would be really great if fit properly"
this is a gorgeous piecethe pattern and color combination are classic fall the sleeves for a xss are slightly short i am  but the rest of the fit is great with the type of fabric and ponchostyle i would recommend wearing something underneath
i love this dress the fabric is a little heavy so it wont blow away on a windy day and bonus even with my triple d chest im comfortable not wearing a bra with this but may not be what you want to wear on a really hot day the shape is flattering on any body typei am  months pregnant and it still looks great it can go from spring to summer to fall quite easily with the addition of a jean jacket and some converse or vans instead of sandals id absolutely recommend this dress
"i had such high hopes but they are just slightly off they run a tad large so i suggest sizing down i usually wear a  or  and the  fit nicely through the hips and thighsunfortunately the color is off i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue but they are actually gray and they have a buttonfly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion i will be returning them"
i am  and i wear my usual  like i always do in pilcro i am so sad that they are too short they are  inches long and its just too short for my legs even with flats the fit is great and they run true to size but they are too short for tall girls i usually buy the wide leg linen pants and those are long enough these needed to be about an inch longer i do recommend them if youre a bit shorter 
this dress isnt as fitted as it looks on the model it appear to be more of a shift dress as gorgeous as the print and quality are it doesnt look great on me for reference im   and bought xs for whatever reason the high neckline isnt flattering on me i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders
"this coat is so lovely it is the embodiment of  classic movie star style the color the style the collar add a subtle flair of drama that you definitely want in your wardrobe  if only it werent for those pesky buttonslike other reviewers i am disappointed to note that within a month of owning the top button popped off in the middle of a dinner date on a rainy night in a french restaurant that same night i noticed a button was missing from one of the sleeves alas i am as yet"
the fun coloring of this tee gives what would otherwise be a basic tee its flare it is a very soft shirt and will be cute with anything the length is good too  you can tuck in or leave out i believe it is tts it might be a little sheer in some lights but i think you could pull it off with a nudecolored bra its not sheer enough to me to warrant an undershirt
i just tried these on at my local seattle store and ended buying a size up i feel they ran small as i am usually a  in most and got the  in these the  fit tight but it looked nothing special just like a very high rise mom jean and i was bursting the top button so this jean is made for hourglass bodies for sure the  is loose and slouchy and it looked really different in a good way so it came home with me they are a washed out black grey color with some tie die effects did not care fo
it was a hard decision but im returning these theyre definitely pretty and wellmade they drape nicely ultimately they are too highwaisted and too billowy for most of my tops which are mostly long and billowy these trousers are too nice to wear with most of my fitted tanks even a normallength tshirt untucked draped weirdly and came down too far on these highwaisted pants i guess theyre too formal for what i had in mind  pictured them more like a maxi skirt if they were hal
this coat is truly gorgeous in person its an investment coat one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely i found it to be very high quality in fact i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it but i dont plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a nonissue for me the lining is one of the best parts of the coat show it off i think the problem
it is a cute top and i loved the fit and its super soft feel but im kind of getting tired of the sheer shirt thing this year i bought this for the summer and its hot here so not wanting to have to wear a shirt under my shirt its not crazy sheer but still undecided if you live in a state with no sweat youll probably be fine  ill have to walk around and try it in different lighting situations and think about it

the small is huge on me and the sweater is very itchy cute idea but not for me i will return it
these are pretty good highrise jeansprobably the best youll find for the price theyre all one color no whisking or fading so they look dressier than your average jeans and the cut through the leg is bone straight which i think flatters most body shapes i agree with the other reviewersthey are tight i got these in a  my usual size and they squeeze my belly i probably couldve sized up but im waiting to see if they stretch out the way most levis do
this is a bit pricey but i think the akemi and kin quality is worth the price this photo is quite inadequate to let you see the gorgeous dye color and floral detail the sleeves are upturned and tacked the curvy hem is very flattering and the designer added a small triangle of cloth at the top of the curvy side just to add to the careful custom detail the   modal is deliciously soft the fine detail in cut fit artistic design will make this not simple tee a divine pleasure

"i bought the orange version during the tag sale and was so pleasantly surprised when it arrived it fits very well and is made from thick high quality material i only wish they had more colors sizingi bought the  and it fits well although a  may have fit better the dress is fairly low cut on me although i am small chested but i wouldnt feel comfortable wearing it to work"
i ordered the black and white version online and the dress fit perfectly it was very wellmade with a nicely textured heavier cloth and the overall appearance is very classy it is a versatile dress and i would highly recommend it
i normally take a small or medium in antrho tops i ordered the xss and im kind of swimming in it i think its a good look though and will complement shorts or skinny jeans i could wear this through all seasons in the pnw so i expect to get a lot of use out of it i was afraid the embroidered shoulders would be stiff and stick out but that isnt the case at all the sweater is all soft and flowy drapes nicely and can be easily dressed up or down worth the price
as soon as i saw this piece online i knew i had to have it like other reviewers the black flower part on the shoulders can be itchy underneath it does run large but thats my style i love pairing pieces like this with skinny jeans or leggings and booties can be dressed up or down highly recommend 
nice flowy dress only thing is that it has the high low skirt which i think is getting outdated beyond that it is a cute dress
i ordered this a few weeks ago on major sale im quite tall  so i went with the ml to ensure that the length would work its definitely long enough almost a little too big but i like the slouchy look my only real complaint is that its a bit itchy other than that i think its a great buy
"this is a great dress that i was eyeing for some time i bought it after new years with the  off discount unfortunately the dress arrived with a defect so i have to have it fixedthe quality of the dress is amazing the details are truly unique one could tell that the dress is very well made however it does run large i bought the xs and feel that i could have downsized at least one to two sizes its very comfortable and it could be dressed up or downoverall im happy with the purc"
ive always loved the idea of jumpsuits but could never find one that worked  either the print was too crazy or the length was too long or the waist line looked funky on me this one worked perfectly im  and the regular xs fit nicely cant wait to wear this especially in the springsummer
this is the first romper i have have purchased and is so cute i am in between a small and a medium usually   lbs and athletic the medium fit okay but with some extra fabricthe small fit better and was much more flattering the romper feel wellmade cant wait to wear it
i really like this sweater a lot it runs huge though i have a ml and im swimming in it  sz  i like the length and the swingyness theres enough coverage for me to feel comfortable layering it over a bra cami and leggings the shoulder detail is what makes it the only downside is that the threads on the reverse side of the embroidery are a little rough but not enough to bother me the knitted fabric is soft and cool feeling i plan on wearing it into fall with real pants and
i ordered this online and was so excited to try it unfortunately it didnt work for me maybe its the style but i had issues with the fit maybe im too long waisted it just didnt seem to fall properly i liked the fabric loved the length could see getting a lot of use from this i would definitely recommend trying it on
this is a really nice quality dress it is a lowcut vneck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me its a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel i am petite in size   i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length also the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd the skirt hit right at knee height
i have been wanting this skirt for a long time i was worried about waist which is fitted i finally ordered it and it i very cute the waist is indeed fitted but there is some give to the fabric fabric is soft cotton not unlike denim with some stretch there i a soft cotton liner in skirt i took the cloth belt off because i cannot retie it so neatly as in the photo also i just dont want a bow on my stomach i own a cute narrow belt that i will wear with skirt as i think something is needed
i should have known with the combined sizing but this is very wide even in the xssm its a beautiful sweater a thicker gauge of yarn than it appears to have and the pointelle holes are also larger than they appear it is fairly itchy if you dont mind that just way too big for my small framealmost falling of the shoulders which is not the look i was going for if you want a wide and boxy look or have a larger frame this could be great for you it is pretty and quite unique
i grabbed my typical size  and found it fit snug in the bust the fabric has plenty of stretch so the snugness was fine especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front its lowcut but i didnt feel particularly exposed i ended up not buying it because i dont think it fit my body right the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me  a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole

i like the feel stretch and softness of this dress its very comfortable sadly as others have commented the armhole openings are just too long causing the dress to fit and look a little off around the chest area on me i considered sizing down to a  but it fit beautifully other than the armhole area unfortunately it will have to go back i am  lbs  and ordered a 
i love the concept of an airy flowing sweater that has great detail this item stole my heart online however i am fairly petite  and it looked like it was drowning me the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldnt hold it up it kept falling off my shoulders i ended up returning i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders

im   with a slender build but have always found rompers to not be figure flattering  however this one was perfect not too short nor long and looks great highly recommend
"likes colors the design of the flower is very pretty the colorblocking is a nice touch and in this season but it is pretty shorti bought thh petite right off the bat as i assumed i would need that but i really dindt it ended up beign too short sleeves always flattering but hte cut is meant to be comfy i think it would have looked better on me if it was a little more hourglass hsaped if that makes sensei am usually xs and that was fine so buy your usual size ok one siz"
gorgeous but so so small recommend ordering  sizes up
this dress is super cute flattering and well made but it runs very small i am usually a  so from other reviews i ordered an  and it is still tight in the hip area it zips but the fabric pulls a bit in the front and it rides up when i walk i am going to try and exchange it for a  because i think ill get lots of wear out of it
if you think you can pull this off by all means try it the fabric is excellent qualitythick yet soft and the floral print is lovely unlike a lot of the prints this season i am not exactly short  and not wide  but this made me look like a houseboat too bad as it is such an interesting cut i ordered down since i can sometimes wear an xs but the bottom was still voluminous
snagged this dress in store today the only reason i didnt give it  stars is because it is dry clean only although i will probably attempt to home wash it runs very large i am usually a medium but currently nursing a baby so need large to fit the chest but i bought this dress in a small also it can be elegantly worn backward so the zipper is in front to provide nirsing access i dont think anyone but you would know you are wearing it backwards very heavy fabric which makes it drape nicel
"ive been eyeing this dress for months so when it went on sale i finally purchased it now i see why its on salethe dress runs extremely large and has no shape looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moomoo in itthis will be going back to the store"
i love this long knit skirt it is great for any of the cooler seasons it has a lovely somewhat aline look when you have it on the knit is a light weight but has a nice feel to it true to size i love the length to pair with tall boots
"i absolutely love this dress when i wear it i feel so graceful and pretty the belt allows you to tie it so that if your weight fluctuates up or down it still looks great i think im going to be wearing this dress all summer love love love i think my only quibble would be that the lining on the inside fits more snugly than the dress itself and when i was walking it rode up its like a stretchy mesh type material but im carrying a few more pounds than id like right now once i lo"

a beautiful blousehowever i assumed from the photo that it had a lining it does not and the blouse is very sheer it seems to run a bit small also and if i add a camisole it might be too tight the length is adequate i may be returning it although it is very lovely and feminine
so disappointed i love retailer this was a huge disappointment i am  and  pounds when i put it on all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look if i wasnt so disappointed i might have laughed this had to have been a design mistake ive truly never seen something so unflattering
"i love this dress the print is beautiful the fabric has a nice heavy drape and the cut is simple but unique im short and curvy so generally shapeless dresses dont work on me this is an exceptioni ordered the regular instead of the petite and it is full length on me which i think i like more than if it were a midithe armholes do cut in i wasnt sure if i liked that until i sized down and it fit closermy husband chuckled that its a little mrs roper i dont care im wea"
i wasnt expecting to love to this dress as much as i do  the length and horizontal stripes petite was sold out and my torso is square are automatically two strikes but the saleonsale price was begging me to give it a go  so glad i did  the cut and flare are flattering  the self to tie is slimming and can be styled different ways  the regular length is doable when i wear platform wedges  the colors scream summer and vacation fun  my only problem is the feel of the fabricliner is fin
i cannot say enough good things about this dress as a petite person  it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations but this dress fit perfectly its also so wellmade the fabric is soft comfortable and gorgeously detailed and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume in a good flattering way i got it shortened by about  but this dress fits like a dream
"very attractive pattern and color the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia the length was fine the fabric meaning the dress is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra areaeven though the facing didnt successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate brathe dress runs very large i ordered an xs petite it was about  inches too large  inches total on either side across the"
i normally wear a size  because of my shoulders and back after reading reviews after purchasing dress online i was expecting it to be too small it is in fact somewhat large i love the way i feel in it i am  and the length is perfect i cannot wait to wear it the black is so soft love the boho feel yet classic and feminine

love this dress great lightweight fabric bold colors and lined to the knee the lining makes sure the dress lies smooth but it breaths well so it doesnt add extra heat i found it ran true to size and its a good length for tall girls i like that you can tie the belt in the front or back looks great on its own or dress it up with a statement necklace there is also a nice girth to the skirt giving it lots of movement great find
"this is an amazing summer dress so pretty it stood out even though only a few were left on the rack its light airy and perfect even for the hottest summer days the straps are not adjustable but for me the dress was not too low and it fit just like on the model pictured a very thin belt comes with it but adds nothing only detracts i am usually a s or m in retailer sizing and the s was perfect   for ref   lbs this dress is so flawless and beautiful and i feel wonderful wearing"
love this dress the other reviews were accurate it is a lot of fabric and i cant decide whether i will actually use the belt that it came with but i think it would be a great beachy dress for the summer
 between looking fat and looking like you have a human being on tap which is way longer than you would imagine another reviewer mentioned that this makes your boobs look huge when cinched which is true and also ok since my boobs are huge now if i wasnt pregnant im not sure i would go with this because it definitely has a lot more fabric to it than the model photos make it appear especially when you cinch but for  months pregnant this dress made me feel fabulous since it toned dow
as soon as i saw this dress i ordered iti didnt want to miss out on it i loved the lookthe colors were so fun and brighti thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii i am  about  i ordered a pxs when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c
i purchased the medium in this sweater as that was all that was left but it fit like a large if not an xlarge its a beautifully made sweater and really soft i now think i know why it suddenly becomes available again here and there its not the kind of sweater you want to wear over sized because as beautifully made as it is its not that flattering if its hanging on you luckily it suddenly became available in a small which i quickly ordered and will keep my figures crossed that its bette
i needed to get this hemmed about  inches but it was well worth it this is a gorgeous effortlessly glam outfit the material is silky soft with some stretch and drapes beautifully i am a  and got an xl i think a large would have been better this had extra width at the waist but it worked with the tie belt i loved wearing this and felt comfortable all night
i found this tts ordered a m im an  and not annoying to put on i ended up being glad it doesnt have a zipper  when i tried it on i thought it would look better with a vneck so i tried it on backwards with the hook and eye open in the front i think its identical back and front except for that and it looks cuter with a slightly lower neckline especially for a bustier person like me i might sew down the flaps on the inside of the neck so it makes a somewhat high vneck with that al
this skirt is much more vivid in person which i like the fit though was off for me i ordered my usual size medium i wear a  or  in bottoms the medium was fitted you could see every curve definitely not comfortable with that i would probably have a better fit with a size up however i am not a fan of the gray lining that you can see on the inner back portion of skirt so i think i will pass on this one
"i loved the design of this suit when i saw it online the material is definitely high quality and the bottoms i knew would stay put if they had fit me in the first place i ordered a size medium in both top and bottom the bottoms were much much too small and the top was just ever so slightly too large i shouldve known something was up with sizing because all of the larges were sold out already i think i couldve used a large bottom and a size small top"
the top is really pretty it is sheer and needs a camisole wish the material was a little softer think it fits true to size
"love me some pilcro jeans these fit like the stet jeansi got my usual size  and the fit is good but not too tight i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it they dont come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like i will say that if you want a true black you may not like this color they are more of a faded black"
i bought this in the pattern in a size medium i am a size   around the hipsbutt the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and didnt outline every curve of my butt the material is very soft and comfortable but it didnt feel thin or cheap or seethrough it has a nice weight to it i am tall almost   and it fit me just as it appears in the picture
"tried and pictured the regular size small my stats are  and i usually wear a  or an  on top in shirts and blazers the small here was nicely loose so it might run a bit bigin person the colors are dark navy on light beigelovely heavy weight cotton and stitchingi think its deliberately a bit short hit at my hip im  but i like thisthe  sleeves are a bit nowhere for mei wish they were full length but thats my only quibble"
since the reviews are quite polarized for this dress i thought id throw in my  to clarify there is indeed a zipper its wellhidden under the l arm i didnt think there was one based on the reviews and got it on zipped fine once it was on i could feel the zipper  dress does not have a lot of give so i imagine that zipped it would be difficult to get off because no give dont order down that said i found this dress to

i was skeptical about the contrasting color details on this blazer and it turns out i was right to be this blazer just looks like part of a prep school uniform both in the colors and the fit which is very boxy maybe this is someones style but i just dont think it looks good
have to disagree with previous posters i found just one of these on the sale rack in my local retailer someone returned it from online and it was adorable on got many compliments in the dressing room area other customers asked if there were more available but its turns out its an online exclusive it does have a zipper i recommend sizing up not because it runs small i think its pretty true to size but i think it looks better a bit loosedrapery fabric is soft and pretty tailoring is f

great fabric not too clingy and provides a forgiving sillhoette very comfortable perfect skirt for summer get togethers or shopping may be a little long if you are on the short side one thing i liked is that the skirt draped well and doesnt hang open or slide up recommend particularly on sale
i love this top it looks exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit i ordered the black and it is somewhat sheer the material has a slight burnout effect the black can be worn without a cami but if i wear it to work i will need to add one
very pretty top with beautiful lace detail both front and back love the way the material feels and it hangs very niceactually slimming i purchased the black  would highly recommend
this midi skirt arrived and i tried it on immediately the fit was perfect and i wanted it badly enough to say that it would balance my  height and  lbs if i just wore a higher heel shoe then i saw the grey lining showing from the back of the skirt through the scalloped front its a beautiful skirt flows nicely and could be flattering on a taller person who can forgive a poorly designed lining i would recommend giving it a try
this shirt is so comfortable soft and super cute definitely recommend
i tried on xs in the store returned and it looked huge on me i like the rushing idea the material is super soft but overall couldnt justify even at sale with  off as it wasnt flattering when it looks big blue color nice in person
very flattering dress but i think the black is more of a washed out navyblack instead of a true black which made matching this with other black times cardigan tightsetc difficult
i was so excited when i purchased this top it was going to be my go to for running around as it looked super cute with leggings and boots the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamasso comfy that all changed after one washingit is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before makes me sad but it is going back
the fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscoserayon the pattern is pretty and flattering sadly the fit was just off big in the center but tight at the hips if i size up the vneck might be too wide im disappointed that ill have to return it it probably would look great on a different body type i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types
i adore this dress its so charming great quality lovely fabric beautiful color the fit is supposed to be boxy and probably wont work on a beautiful curvy body with a petite athletic body i feel beautiful in it i wear a small or xs and i definitely needed an extra small pair it with black or camel sandals or boots its lovely
i saw this online and didnt think twice about it but then i came across it at my local store and its so much better in person it is incredibly soft and cozy i purchased the gray stripe version and two solid color versions creamforrest green i can see this being a great staple over the fallwinter with leggings boots and a long pendant
this dress fits true to size i ordered an xs like i usually wear as a small was falling off of me when i had tried on in store the colors are more vibrant in person its a really pretty dress and is very well made the fabric is solid and light weight i dont think it would work for someone with a lot of curves unless they sized up though as it is a really straight dress that is meant to lay free
im a big ag fan so i was excited to receive these for my birthday i really love everything about them but boy were they long even with a  inch heeled boot i was stepping on the hem im  so i dont often have to get things hemmed but that was a must with these jeans i recommend these jeans but unless youre  foot tall plan on running them to the tailors
mutliple layers of buttery softness i bought the blue and its true to size it is soo soft i could wear this to sleep it drapes beautifully highly recommend it now i want to buy all the colors
i love this piece theyre calling it a tunic but its plenty long enough to wear without any pants i usually wear a smallxsmall in retailer sizes and i definitely went with the xsmall size down to avoid the potato sack look i think this piece is so great for fall definitely a must buy
i loved this dress and tried on the xs in the store and then ordered the petite i thought if i ordered the petite it would not be as baggy it is just way to boxybaggy for someone my height and weight however i would recommend to someone taller because the velvet is great quality and it would have been an amazing dress to have for fall and also for winter for reference i am  and weight  pounds
i love the way this dress moves on you and the high low a medium fit me perfectly i am  and the long part in the back barely touches the floor in flat shoes the colors are sort of fall but the top is like a sun dress i think you could wear this any time of year with the appropriate accessories i wore it with a  length sleeved cardigan and sandals in oct and it was perfect the fabric feels nice great quality its on sale so you have nothing to loose
i bought this in the blue motif and i love the colors of the plaid the first day i wore it i received many compliments the armholes are a bit low but i wore a cami underneath i dont think it is that noticeable unless your arms are raised the whole time i like my shirts to be a bit longer and this is perfect since i have a longer torso i am normally a size  and the med fit perfectly
love this hoodie so soft and goes with everything highly recommend for comfort and style great company
i bought this shirt in every color i look sexy and the best part is how comfortable it is it is very versatile i wear it at networking semi formal events dinners going out with friends and everywhere i feel awesome with it
i read all the reviews before purchasing this and took the advice of others on sizing up i am  hourglass shape   inch waist size  pant size and normally wear a size  in retailer dresses i ordered a  and the top was way too big on me i went straight to an retailer store to try on a  regular and the top half was perfect on me a little too long for my liking about an inch below my knee so i reordered it in a  this dress ran true to size for me i recommend trying it on in
i absolutely love this dress its a great summer dress thats flirty and fun i feel this dress runs pretty true to size except in the bust area the buttons at the top pull a little bit on me unless i wear a bra that pushes the girls up and together im a  just so you have an idea im  about  lbs and im a  in dresses im usually able to get away with a  i have a bigger bust and bum but a super tiny waist im just barely able to get away with wearing a  in this dres

i ordered the  in red and love these pants the only problem is even in petites these are long on me maybe ok with  inch heels the cut is comfortable and flattering i have muscular thighs and these fall nicely on me the color is also nice for this fall i purchased last years version grey and turquoise but reverse from what is offered this year and they are very comparable although i bought them too big last year fabric not prone to easy wrinkling highly recommend reference 
if i ever find something i can wear sans bra i am pretty much going to buy it just looking at this dress i wouldnt think it possible but it is this is a rare occurrence for me honestly the dress is a little tight a pulls a little bit across the chest  but being able to go braless trumps that for me hopefully it isnt too noticeable i did find the straps to be extremely long so i had them shortened this dress is adorable and ive received so many compliments its so comfortabl
saw this jacket online and decided to search in store for it i found it and although it definitely looks more mustard in the picture online compared to the bright yello it really is i felt it fit very well it runs large i usually am a size  however i ended up buying a size  for a more fitted cropped appearance the material is heavy but made very well and feels great on i recommend this blazer for any female that wants to brighten her closet up for spring
love these leggings great fit great look perfect with boots and oversized sweater bought a couple of different fabrics highly recommend
ive been hesitant with crushed velvet comebackbut this dress is adorable first it is not a tent on me its the perfect fit for the style  not too swingy but definitely not fitted this is the dress you can grab on a day you dont feel like sucking it in throw a blazer over it if you need you look professional wear to a girls brunch with booties or a night out with the hubs the little extra detail i didnt see online that was a pleasant style surprise is the almost straplooking piece
it is very cute i think actual one is much better than the picture
"i bought this dress as a birthday present to myself which i wore to a recent weekend vacation to dallas texas and i absolutely love it i love the color and the design of the dress as i think it is timeless and i will get a lot of use out of it for years to come however this dress is tight in the chest area and i would recommend sizing up i am   pounds and usually wear a us size  but when i tried this dress on in a size  the dress stopped buttoning up underneath my bust i end"

im not sure why its considered a blue motif i think its more on the black and cream side other than that this is a great silk top for warmer weather its lightweight and airy and youll probably want to wear a nude bra underneath looks great with jeans and heels for a fun night out as well as trousers for work im  and almost  lbs with a  bust and a small fit great
i tried this dress on in the store but decided to think about it because of price i ended up buying it later on line i usually wear a medium    lbs wide shoulders but got a small in this dress it does run the risk of looking like a sack but sizing down did the trick the easy going loosness yet elegance is why i like it it is so comfy but looks lucious i plan to wear it often this fall and christmas
i saw this dress in the store and immediately grabbed it i think that if id only seen it online i wouldnt have looked at it twice in person the fabric is so beautiful a shining and classy velvet crinkle that could go way way dressy with the right accessories this dress runs large like all of floreats items i am   and normally wear an xs or  but had to size down to xxs petite for the right fit like on the model the only drawback is dry clean only based on the content of th
the blue color is sublime  the material velvet iridescent cool  the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting  add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
i love the color coralpink and the open shoulder design of this top but its too blousy at the bottom way too much fabric i ordered a small i am  and  lbs i might try an xs if they still have them in stock fabric is comfortable the ties on the sleeves add a special touch
when i saw this dress online i immediately passed on it but i was drawn to its faint shimmer and soft feel in the store and decided to try it on i am usually xs  s in dresses and tried the xs    waist it fit beautifully it comes about a couple of inches above my knee and makes me look slim from the side  which isnt typical of shift dresses i plan on wearing it with flats now and tights and booties when the weather gets cooler would be a great holiday or new years eve dress
i have been dreaming of the perfect overall that i can live in this springsummer these overalls completely fit the bill i would normally wear a size  but i wanted the fit to be more relaxed with a slight slouchy look i went with a a size  and they are exactly what i wanted i feel like i can move around feely in these they are extremely comfortable and the denim is pretty lightweight i highly recommend these

love these wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots nice subtle print i think they run about  size small im normally a size  the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough incidentally i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too love love
i purchased this dress to wear to a horse race but will also be wearing it all summer long the material is light weight and has a vintage flare to the print the button in the center of the dress add an extra detail that keeps the dress pretty and casual
"the navy version of these pants are beautiful the contrast gray stripe is subtle and slimming and continues through details in the pocketsi am   and i wore a size  regular and  petite the regulars were very long and even heels couldnt help them the pant leg covered my foot covered my toes the petites were much better and i rarely order petite they hit the bottom of my foot with no heels so i think a heel would make them look right im just not sure if the petite"
i love these pants they are a great addition to my work wardrobe the fit is very flattering with the wide legs falling perfectly and they are a great length i got the red which is a beautiful and brighter than the pics the fabric is a nice weight perfect for fl winters i personally like the midrise as it helps with tucking in shirts that are on the shorter side i highly recommend these pants as a nice alternative in color and cut for the office im  and  and i purchased the
love this dress  i sized up from a  to an  because of the small bust issue and it fits perfect  perfect casual summer dress with a vintage feel
i usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me sadly this dress is a definite exception which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress as other reviewers stated the dress does run small but even if you size up if you have any breasts at all the dress will pull at the buttons causing them to gape im only a b cup so not on the large side im pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture i love
i love this dress it is a fun and flirty summer dress i think it can be dressed up or worn casually i am a   waist  hips i bought a size  and it fits me great as others said it is a little snug across the chest but i think it is supposed to be with the proper bra it fits very comfortably i am going to wear it for mothers day brunch

i got this on sale i sized up from my normal  to a  based on reviews the  is too large for me and id need a  which is sold out the straps are very long i think even if i sized down id have to have them altered also the dress i got is missing the bottom button sending back im not too sad i ordered the pink pippa swing dress with the same order and love it
i have featured two pictures below one is size s the other is xs petite im  feet  and a  d i highly recommend this dress i definitely could have gone either way but felt sizing down would be more flattering
i love this dress it fits perfect im   and ordered xsi think the off white stone color is true to the picture i will be wearing this dress as my wedding dress for our small intimidate wedding i cant wait
love the detail quality of make and fabric comfort  ive been looking for a top like this  expect that it  will wash fine its not see through and i always wear a nude bra  got xs in white and it fits well not too loose and billowy  im   highly recommend
this jacket is just as stunning in person as online high quality and just overall fabulous design as much as i loved it though i couldnt get over the fact i was jingling every time i moved it seemed like it could cause piling issues and i thought it might get annoying wearing for an entire day i loved this and wanted so hard to keep it but i need functional chic pieces not noise makers anyways fit was great looked just like the model on me so i would recommend but with caution as for this
the design and fabric on this suit are even more gorgeous in person than online i am  and between  and ordered a medium the thing i especially like about this suit is that it has adequate cup size and support i am a  or d depending on the bra and this suit is very flattering and provides nice coverage and cup support the straps can be shortened if you want a little more bust support the material and design of the suit itself feel substantial and even without the straps it do
the ruching on this suit is super flattering i ordered the medium  i am    lbs and usually a solid medium in most retailer items  though i would definitely recommend sizing up with this guy i was able to get it on and it certainly held everything in place but since it is a one piece pulling it on was a bit of a struggle and i certainly could have used about an inch more fabric from top to bottom i will be returning and exchanging for a large
i love this dress i think it will be awesome to wear this summer but also a great transition piece into fall very boho
this top would be great if it were longer and the neck wasnt so open even for a boatneck the neck was too wide for those that dont mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me
you will need to get these pants hemmed if you are not six foot tall as they are quite long  but they are so cute that the extra alteration expense is worth it  imagine wearing pants that feel like pajamas but that look like a million bucks  is this not every womans fashion fantasy
i really love this top but am afraid i may need to return it because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it and they show really badly as black spots because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads it feels so good on though you must be super careful with it i have no idea how the little snags even got there
the pants are everything i expected and much more the material is a delicious and light weight the colors are beautifulwhite base with jade green and black design there is a very comfortable elastic band waist with tie i am  and ordered the longer length and they are just to the ground i weigh  and have a slim figure and the medium is a very comfortable fit i would highly recommend these if you like looks that are up to date and comfythese are a winwin
"this skirt looks great on i didnt even think before buying it planning to wear it all summer so the aesthetic is great quality and design not so much you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates it is not sewn in or built to last then it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it but they said they would have to resew the whole garment not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran"
these are huuuuge im   i ordered the small but unfortunately they were way to big i might have tried the xs however didnt care for the pattern as much as the picture i think these would work better on taller fuller figure girls
love this top looks really cute with a pair of high waist jeans it is a nice thick cotton fabric that does not stretch out after wearing it is short so for me the high waist pants were a must but if you dont mind showing your belly then it would be cute with anything the boat neck collar is not so wide that it shows your bra straps as with some overall it was a good fit
this is so comfortable and so flattering i got it in two colors i think it runs tts i sized up so i could wear it lower on my hips im  and got the regular size rather than petite and its more of a maxi skirt on meway longer than on the model this is what i wanted i can never find maxi skirts that arent way too long even when i try petite but if you want it more midi go for petite sizing
i absolutely adore this top it is super soft i purchased it in the wine color i would recommend this for anyone if they have other colors i plan on buying them i am going to wear this with jeans and my furry vest in the fallwinter
i agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me if you dont mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially then it might be for you i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up

i bought this dress on clearance and think it will be cute next summer on a superhot day with ballet flats i have no idea what its doing in the fall collection am looking forward to wearing it  months from now

i am very happy with this shirt i dont like skin tight clothes i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots i love the way it flows while i walk very flattering on would definitely recommend
i bought this for our daughter i tried it on when it arrived and the material is fabulous and feels soooo good against the skin the purple is a stunning color  very subdued and classy if she does not like it on christmas after gifts are opened guess who is going to keep it for herself if she loves it as much as i think she will then ill just have to get one for myself the pleats in the back are very flattering best of all is the fabric it is luxurious thank you retailer for yet another
very pleased with this top i got the blue and white first and now im getting the red and white the material is comfy and not sheer and the slits at the side and the zipper in back add extra style
"this would be a great dress if it was sized correctly i ordered my usual xs and was shocked at how large it was sadly the grayblack color is no longer available in xxs a size i would never typically order and is not available in petite sizes i liked the design the fabric and the color if you are lucky enough to be larger than a size xs i recommend ordering one size smaller than your usualfor reference im   lbs  and usual wear a size  in dresses and pants i"
i love this comfy top and if it couldnt get any better the pleated back makes it extra special it is easy to thrown on and still feel put together i purchased this top in the green and im absolutely enthralled by the rich color i do agree that the quality of the pleats could be slightly better however i believe its up to par with the price point i typically wear an xsxsp and ultimately decided to go with a small for a more oversized tunic top look but otherwise id go for your normal
i love this top i think the knit rib quality is quite lovely and the color is gorgeous i bought the plum color and got many compliments while wearing it i like that its a little on the longer side i wore it with my pullon ponte pants and booties very cute
if youre a curvy girl like me this shirt is very flattering hangs nicely in the front not too clingy also has that accordian back which is very nice because it hides my back fat the plum is gorgeous was king it for the first time so cant yet comment on how it holds up with washing or whether the back retains its accordian loom with the hang to dry recommendation
these legging are adorable i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome the buttons at the ankle are cute i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i dont like to spend so much on leggings
this color is really cool because it can go with black grey or tan shoes the back pleats are unique and do not add bulk the back is also lined so you dont need a tank fits tts and i thought it was fairly flattering on sale this is a great deal
my husband bought me this set for christmas and it was hands down my favorite gift these leggings let me tell you about these leggings so comfortable so cute buttonscolorpattern love they way they feel on my legs as soon as i get home from work i put them on well a lot of days i am ordering another pair i am someone who doesnt do leggings i would go as far as saying that this lounge set actually makes me feel sexy thats how much i love them

fit is true to size color is accurate love the feel of the knit its weightier than if anticipated im looking forward to wearing this to my pnw trips
i just purchased this sweater but have not worn it yet as it is still very hot in the vadc area the print is super cute in person it reminds me of a missoni knit pattern the color is described as gray motif but its really more greens and browns very fall colors the sweater is soft and comfortable the knit is fine not chunky and doesnt add bulk it is fitted through the chest with an empire waist and flowing over your stomach and hip area wonderfully forgiving of any extra bulges you
this dress is beautifullovely colors and designbut its huuuge im usually a sm in tops and dresses but i got an xs after trying it on in the store im busty and have hips and still have a bit of room the length is gooda little above the knee but still work appropriate with my curves its not my most flattering dress since it pretty much falls straight down but i think its too pretty not to keep
my preference is clothing made of natural fibers but i couldnt resist trying this on once i felt it the cutout pattern in the fabric the color  the buttons  the design of the back all add to make a dress im going to wear with leather flipflops during the day or wedges  a denim jacket at night its perfect for southern california fall  likely much of winter this year weather im a   wont needwear a bra  although i usually wear a  i bought a  maeve i like your style
i wore this top recently and received several compliments its a great top with the off the shoulder trend plus you can wear a normal bra underneath runs large so i recommend one size down
beautiful dress flowing but not too much volume not too short but not dowdy gorgeous deep jade color with chartreuse accents flattering waist not sure why the model is covering that part up but its a nice waist with a tie belt i think it looks really smashing in person not too formal perfect for a daytime event like a bridal shower
this dress is gorgeous with fine detailing and even though im curvier than the model it still fits well and is flattering please see attached poor quality photos im    i usually wear a  and the small is great my only complaint is that the bottom of the skirt around the ankles is super tiny and i feel like i have to take ittybitty steps its a bit offputting not to be free to stride normally i recommend the dress but you may consider like i am having a professional add

i bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip  and i think itll do just fine its a wonderful opengauge knit  delicate and light but substantial enough that i dont fear snagging it constantly the cloth has a nice weight and drape and while the fit is on the loose side it does look intentional wonderful as a pullover or by itself i have the minty bluegreen color and its divine definitely worth the price
i love this jacket something to get cozy in on cool california winter nights and still light enough to wear open and walk around without getting too hot i am  and have a medium frame but  dd on top i bought a medium because i hate things to be tight around my chest and this is perfect my only disappointment is that i wish it had pockets i got the wine color and it is very beautiful wonderful unique and comfortable jacket i do recommend it
tried this on yesterday in the fitting room and i really wanted to get it but two problems   not made for c cup bra women or larger and  the ruffles come right out of the nipple line area of the chest so when you see yourself at a profile view theres these ruffles that look like theyre coming out of your chest just sayin not for me
i just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet ive been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it it fits like it was made just for me the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem the second layer is form fitting and soft i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down like a lady and take in my surroundings after all life
i just bought this and tried it on on a whim and am so happy i did its so much more flattering on than this photo depicts i think itll be one of my summer staples this year give it a try
oh how i love this dress i was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the fabric it is a wonderful feel of cotton and not that poly that sticks to your fingers it fits like a dreamtrue to sizeromantic and flirtyi can see this with cowboy boots and hat as well as with evening sandalsthe possibilities are limitless i am so happy i was finally able to snag one up as a return because it sold out just love it i also plan to wear it in the fall with a jean jacket it is a winter whit
such a pretty skirt i think its a very versatile piece a bit heavier cant wait to wear when it cools down more i saw the dress that is similar to the skirt in the catalog last month and loved it too note the skirt does not have the same shine in the fabric that the dress does
this is one of my new favorite dresses i ordered this in pink and think it looks even more gorgeous in person that it does on the model its more of a reddish color the dress hugs my body in a flattering way im a  and the dress fits very comfortably but it might be a tight fit for someone with a larger bust im usually a small for retailer dresses and the small fit like a glove it is wonderfully flowy and extremely elegant i cant wait to wear this out
this was such an impulse buy i bought it online during a sweater sale and i am so glad i did this is definitely one of my favorite recent purchases it definitely seems more like a coat than a sweater but it is lightweight i ordered the red and it is beautiful it looks great buttoned or left open and i think this could be dressed up or down though it does have a hood so that gives it a slightly more casual feel it fits true to size and it is definitely shorter in the front than the ba

"i tried this dress on in the store and it fit pretty much perfectly in all the right areas except that the top of the zipper puckered away from my body and didnt lay flat it just kept poking my arm i tried it in a smaller size to see if that was the issue but i encountered the same issue too bad as it was otherwise lovely and felt very comfortablei tried the green color i think in person its slightly more rich green less blueaqua than the photos online"
love this skirt purchased it in a  and it fit fairly good sat high up on the waist which i like however now that i have worn it i should have ordered it in a  i think the  would have let it sit further down making it not so short i do recommend this skirt but i would order both your regular size and one size up  is my typical size in full skirts

i bought this dress because it was cute swinging and lightweight  seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer after on wash and dry the dress is already ripped around two buttons ill still wear it but i dont think itll last until next summer kind of pitiful since it wasnt a cheapo dress also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point
after reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out unfortunately the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot i like the idea but its just not a flattering cut or material going back
loved almost everything about this top the colors are great comfortable fit but the length was a little too long for my  frame i also wasnt a big fan of the large side slit i would still recommend this great top

i love the color combo and the design make me feel tall and thin i know this is going to be very cool to wear on a hot day i like it with my white jeans and you can wear it a number of ways i love this brand i still wear the plaid from last spring its a got to have
i love wearing this to bed and its really pretty the lace is thin and delicate so it can get snagged easily but its pretty comfortable the only thing that could make it more comfortable is if the material underneath the bust was looser though it wouldnt be as supportive overall i think its a very beautiful chemise
very comfortable fits true to size i also have this in white fits snug in the top but hangs loose around the waist making it very comfortable shirt is very flattering the polka dots add a playful touch super cute
i took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one ive been eyeing this online for quite some time so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price it came in the mail the other day its like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door however this time wasnt so great the top is fine average at best the top fits true to size maybe its the pattern or the cut but it didnt work well on my body i recommend trying this on first
"the neckline is beautiful whether pulled forward or slipping back the pure merino knit is very fine with the two front panels cut on the bias raglan sleeves with high armholes it is a tiny bit itchy and normally im not too sensitive but that may improve with a handwash in eucalan or something similarfit for size xs on  currently   or  bra with narrow shoulders and torsosnug at the shoulders but as it is a pure merino knit it does stretch the front length just"
while this is cozy and well made the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho which looks unfinished had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous unfortunately the faded backside of the pattern a glimpse of it under models left hand viewable through the very large arm holes and impossible to hide disrupts the effortless fluid feel that a poncho should have i was
i love this shirt it is so soft and a bit see through so recommend wearing a camisole underneath perfect with jeans the fit is slightly boxy but works well
the red detail at the shoulders is pretty and i liked the contrast between the red and white the fabric is soft and comfortable it is a sweater knit fabric more substantial than you might guess from photos the sleeve ruffles were a little poofy for me and combined with the loose fit it made me feel a little too girlish this could work for you if you are looking for a peasant style blouse with a forgiving shape and nice details but it wasnt quite right for me
these pants were a wonderful addition to my wardrobe the fun print and texture add interest but at the same time are not too busy they seem wellmade and they have a slim and flattering fit the side zipper is also a nice touch i would definitely recommend this item

i saw this suit in the store and was immediately drawn to it i did not think it was gonna work because i have boobs real ones and i was not sure it would provide enough support it is the cutest suit ever have enough support to get away with it but definitely couldnt go for a jog ha it will also look great with white jeans and double as a bodysuit
im   lbs curvy and fit im usually a size  but when i tried these shorts on they were tight i sized up to an  and they looked better but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite curvy frame i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area
while i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat as a size  with hips it does my hips no favors but the comfort and warmth make up for it this coat is so soft its like wearing a puffy blanket unlike typical puffer coats it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all with all that said the comfort and cosy feel won me over ive received several compliments as well so maybe its more

i absoluty love this dress it hugs in all the right places giving a sexy yet very classy look very much a mad men look the quality is fantastic and could easily pass for a vintage dress that has been kept safely preserved i would recomend every lady has one of these in her closet especially when you need to feel just a little bit prettier
"i loved this the minute i saw it in the store but left without buying it  i called the store an hour later and asked them to hold it for me so i could get it the next day i love it  its still a little too warm to wear it in nyc yet but i will soon im thinking  is the perfect temps for it  i rarely say this but i dont think the photos of the coat above do it justice"
i like that you can dress this shirt up or down go out or lounge in it very comfortable and i would recommend buying it
i was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs it was huge reminded me of a maternity top it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model the material was nice thin but not see through the macrame detailing seemed well made id recommend this if youre looking for a flowy top but definitely size down
i just bought this today so i cant say whether or not it will wear well but i think it will i love it bc its different and super comfy but also stylish i know that when i wear this other people wont have it on i think it looks better in person than on this model in picture

so bummed i ordered this in the raspberry color then actually saw it in a store before it arrived to my house so i tried it on while i agree with the other reviews it runs big in some areas something about the neckline just wasnt right on me it seemed to ride up higher and wasnt what i wanted also the raspberry color is almost more of a burnt orange when i think of raspberry i think of pink or red this was neither of those the top itself is cute though and super comfy if it we

size down on this top bought it online and when i took out of the packagei quickly put it back in you could have put  of me in the xs i think even an xxs would be huge extremely boxy i recommend it only if you can find the correct size

so this top is adorable light and airy and i like the loose fit i think it will nice and cool for summer the red is very flattering color i have fairer skin and feel like it gave nice color without being overbearing love this top my only complaint is that i feel like the the arm hole is a bit snug not enough to not keep just wish there was a little more room

"as you can see there is an array of differing opinions on here and i share sentiments on bothpros the texture and feel of this is great it is very comfortable and is different tts for the most part i normally can wear sizes  and  m and l with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips if youre more slimstraight itll probably fit you like on the model  good length not too short or too long the mock collar is ni"
these have a great fit  design i ordered a size larger after reading that this style runs on the small size typically im a  but ordered a  the wash has a great vintage feel about it i also love that these do not lose their shape after wearing all day
i took this into the dressing room for fun and wow so glad i did i got the regular m and it fits perfectly it is very slightly roomy but i think thats the design and it still looks great as a petite the regular m fit perfectly  heals or no heals its comfy and lovely
cute pants not for me a petite size may have changed my mind more like ankle pants on my  frame and a bit large all over that said the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable love the snaps on the waistband classy casual
so i ordered a  and  when i received them i could tell right away that id prefer the  and it looked to be the perfect size then i tried to slip it on over my shouldersit was tight it was the right size but it was so hard to get on over my shoulders and then to take it off i needed my husbands help it fit great otherwise i loved the feel of the fabricthe design of the bodice going up a size would not help me as then it would be too large in the bust areaim a  but i do hav
i loved the shirt the fabric was amazing and i loved the way it fit unfortunately it didnt look good on me but i would recommend this shirt to anyone who can pull it off the look i was sad i couldnt
this top is sold out in my size online but i was fortunate enough to snag one in the store great top that can be dressed up or down the ruching across the front is very slimming tried the top with skirts and pants  looks great with everything i usually wear a size small in deletta tops but sized up to a medium to accommodate my chest i am a full c cup i highly recommend this purchase
i wanted to love this shirt its got a thicker material a flattering shape and the uniqueness for a basic top however when i put this on it just looked like it was illfitting over the chest i think if the pull was below the chest it would be much better
received this top as a gift from a friend with great taste found fabric to have high quality feel and texture and it fit quite well love how the flutter layer creates a different look
this is a wonderful onepiece swim suit its very flattering on and the colors and design are just lovely i also love the suits vintage feel and that its sexy without being overly revealing i seldom pay full price for clothing but this item is definitely worth every penny i bought a size medium and it fit perfectly
i love this top im   lb and the small fits well probably could have fit in the xs it is more fitted at the top and flowy at the bottom i ordered it in orange and it is a very pretty peachy coral stripe highly recommend for a comfy top that can be dressed up a bit more than your average tshirt
i really like the look of this jacket but i think it runs small and i must return the one i received i am debating about ordering the next size up because it is so cute it can go with jeans or khakis and bright or white shirt underneath it seems very versatile will be a good transition piece between seasons i also like that it is made in the usa
i fell in love with this online and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic although i am not usually into pink this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc cant wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it for reference i am   chest and the small fit perfect the quality is really high end as well
i ordered this blazer so i could look more puttogether for work but still feel comfortable it checks both of those boxes its almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure and has a great cutstyle my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes but the white part is actually a light heathered gray i think i would have preferred white but i still like it enough to keep got my normal size small which fit great

the material was a little itchy in my opinion the fit was pretty big almost a night shirt im   and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights i got a small i purchased the orange color online stay away if you have an olive skin tone its the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website im  pounds 
so i really loved this dress i am tall  and the size  was perfect length i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals i would say it is true to size i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of flow without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack the back is just gorgeous and unique here is why i couldnt make it mine the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin there is literally not much to it and im not sure it wou
i bought this top when i was  months pregnant and wore it the rest of the pregnancy i am   and  lbs i got all the way up to  and a chest size of  now that im not pregnanti dont think it flatters my new figure anymore ha but i seriously wore it all the time when i was pregnantso gotta give it at least  stars
its an adorable take on the casual sweatshirt i love the layers but i wish they were just a little different they hang a little strange perhaps if the bottom one was a smidge longer im not sure or if the sweatshirt layer was a little longer and the blouse bit was therefore longer it all hangs just a littleoff but its not so off that it looks bad im petite so its cute on but i think if you were tall it might hang a little weird a warning though i ordered a small and the
this dress is lovely i tried it in the red and the black decided to keep the red as i have so much black going to wear to a spring wedding  i will feel so comfortable and appropriate just looking for a great statement necklace
tts and very feminine and flattering looks same as on model love this style if you like style highly recommend  armholes not too big yay
in my opinion the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase adorable cut and style comfortable and cute its the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans love this
i love this tunic i am typically an xxs petite so i should have known that the regular xs would be too large but i took a chance on it unfortunately it was in fact much too large it is too bad because i absolutely love it the fabric is soooo soft and comfy i ordered it in the blue and it is prettier than pictured this is a great dress for the beach or poolside or just knocking around if you live in a hot climate or take warmweather vacations i highly recommend this it takes up ve
this is one of those dresses that might be better for those under  on me the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady i miss not having to consider those things the red color is lovely and the dress is modest i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita

this cardigan is super soft and comfy with nice big pockets and an easy feel i am glad i read the other reviews before i bought it though i usually wear an xl and they are often too small but i ordered a large and even that one is a bit on the generous size but i really like it a lot
i originally purchased this sweater in a size small   and i was swimming in it i went into the store and exchanged it for a size xs and it still runs a little big i do love the quality though and its so soft its made of a sweatshirt like material which gives it a lazy sunday feel it is definitely more casual than your typical cardigan but is so cozy this is quickly becoming a go to for after yoga or just lazy sundays at home great product
great top i ordered online because i needed a white top that i could get away with wearing in fall to work even though its white im busty and normally shirts like this make me look gigantic like im going to tip over but this was a very flattering cut and fit i highly recommend it was also comfortable and i wore it with blue slacks to work the flower is partially dark blue im  and the length was perfect not too long in the butt but enough to cover it subtly

i received this yesterday and the fit for me is so strangeto tight in the bust and the arms were to big for mei am so bummedthe arms do not stay on my shoulders i have many tops but maeve and they fit me wellthis is the first one i have to return this top is made well and i do recommend but it should be tried on before purchasing as it is pricey if it does not fit you
i bought this top in a large i washed it in cold water and it shrank just enough to flatter the material is great in that when i washed it the blouse hanged quite nicely no ironing needed also the material is heavy enough that no tank is needed underneath the top thakoon had made the same top last summer and it had cost around  this top is even better due to the material and i could buy it for a fraction of the price highly recommend
this top us flowy breathable and feminine the fabric is light so it doesnt feel like youre wearing a swing dress with heavy fabric it is sheer so a cami underneath is best with flowers less structured tops i size down to a small or  some other tops id go to medium or 
i bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy and it is the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack its perfect for running around town for errands i actually didnt think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more formfitting pieces yes big surprise but he actually commented out of the blue that its really sexy comfy and sexy score
"i bought the navy polka dot top and i love the way the design lets you work orange into your wardrobe if its a color you wouldnt normally wear the blouse is sheer so a camisole is needed underneath im looking forward to layering over the blouse in the fall to add a pop of pattern to a navy sweaterim a  and size  fit me easily with extra room under the arms the gathering stops above the bust so that it fits snug above and loose below worn loose the blouse is fairly long coverin"
"the top is a pretty and has a nice pattern it does run large and is it a bit billowy i am  petite and ordered a small  maybe the xs would have been better however the top swallowed me up and was unflattering the colors are true to the picturenot very bright but would be a nice transition to fall topthe feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better"
i bought this in the purple print the fabric is soft  similar to silk looks great with black burgundy tan pantsskirts i find it comfortable and received compliments on it at worki have not washed yet  cannot comment on washability
incredibly flattering cut i got so many compliments when i wore this dress to a friends wedding with the built in bra you dont have to add extra uncomfortable layers it stays put with or without the straps the skirt is blissfully full and fun for twirling i had a little trouble figuring out the belt as it wraps around multiple times but once i worked that out it was perfect love this cut i hope they make it again it different colors
i am so in love with these pants i generally stay away from wide legged pants because i think they make me look shorter i am already short but these are awesome the fabric is not very thick so they are moveable which is great but not so moveable that they feel like palazzo pantsthey will hold their shape i love the polka dot design so much and i actually really love the whole outfit with the black tietop these pants are long on me but it isnt surprising since i am pretty short i am t

wow that dress is short at least the epite was not falttering on muscular thighs perhaps a regualr size on that one would work but the bodice was a perfect fit so not sure there i decided not to try it on as i figured this dress is very seasonal and trendy otherwise if you ahve the money to spare and leaner legsi would recommend it the cut was actualyl flattering otherwise i didnt have bunching issues like others and my  boobs fit in the  color and pattern are prett
the material is so soft and i really like the design i got the map one as others mentioned sleeves are quite short almost morel like a muscle tee than a tshirt but i dont mind looks really cute under a cardigan for fall too
"designs are nice and texture feels comfortable but sleeves are odd because they are angledi wonder what i should do to look cool in this tshirti tried wearing neutral motif but i still felt oddalso width is relatively wide so it runs largei rated average for overall rating because of these odd sleeves and feelingspersonally i do not recommend this tshirt but who knows it may be right for youso my advice is to try wearing it in a fitting room and check whether it loo"
gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for
i ordered this dress in my usual sz  it seemed to be tight on the hips  then i tried the next sz  and it was tight because i realized that the lining was very sticky and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me not for curvy on bottom i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute and i really liked the look of the dress if it goes on sale i may purch
im so in love with these pants they are so flattering and made of thick material they do run a bit large though so id suggest you size down i also like they theyre high waisted the gold button details are gorgeous as well great pair of pants
the print on this dress harkens to the old days of retailer if you miss the fun prints and whimsical styles playful textures and conversational pieces  this dress is for you at    waist i bought the size  runs tts site claims its a fit and flare but i think its more of a sheath cut the thicker canvas like material has stretch but gives good form i wear mine as a jumperpinafore with a white shirt sleeve blouse my only complaint is that  as a dress  the arm holes are a
cant wait for the weather to get warmer so i can wear this one as others have said the material is heavier but i think thats a positive as it is very structured and slimming im a fan of maeve dresses and this is no different
great dress love how flattering it is and that it has a little bit of a retro feel the dress is well made too
this pullover is perfect for spring all the way into fall it is comfortable and the perfect piece to throw on over a summery tank and jeans ive even worn it over dresses before and it worked great soft fabric but durable ive had a lot of compliments on this pullover and recommend it for you
i got the dress with the boat pattern such a fun dress and very flattering it is definitely a coral but i am able to wear this with my fair skin and will probably look better with some color as springsummer finally arrive i am only  so the length is great for me i can wear this to work but it would be pretty short for a tall gal definitely recommend
this dress makes me this of jackie kennedy on the beach in the summertime i love the pattern and the pockets oh my goodness the pockets i saw this in the store and ordered one while i was there online because the ribbon on the zipper was frayed well guess what we i got it in the mail at home the ribbon was also frayed ugh i kept it because it wasnt a huge deal breaker the color is a little strange not a true red more of a orangish red i think its super versatile and hopefully i will w
these pants are a great buy now that its on sale even though the weather is warming up it can be stashed away until next cold season because it is timeless the fabric is thick but not bulky the side zip is flattering and the buttons add a touch of flair which make the pants look very tailored size  regular fit me well on the waist and hips im   waist  hips i cut off  inches of the hem so i can wear it with  i prefer the regular size for elevenses pants because the
when you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it  down to  uuuuggghhh i like the dress fine enough but it has a weird under wire it makes my chest look strange like i dont fill it in i usually dont have that problem as a c cup more orangered then yellow as well wouldnt recommend
like other reviewers have mentioned i was hesitant to spend so much money on a swimsuit after lots of searching and reading reviews to try to find a bathing suit for a newly postpartum body i went for it i am so happy that i did  it fits perfectly snug in all the right places and makes my extra baby pudge seem nonexistent before baby i was a bikinionly kind of girl so i wasnt sure how id feel in a one piece in this style it really is better than i could have imagined i highly recom
this bathing suit is absolutely fabulous it makes me feel like i stepped out of the notebook definitely worth every penny
i love these jeansthe minute you put them on they feel broken in and comfortable they do have a long inseam and need to be worn with a stacked heel but that adds to the aesthetic i ordered my normal sizei usually wear a  and could have kept thembut wanted a snugger fit through the bum so i gave them to a friend and ordered one size down and got the perfect fit for me
loved the idea of this topbut it just wont work for me its really big im  and  lbs a small should be fine but im swimming in this the back is pretty i tried it on with a white cami but it looks very maternity on me tried to order the xs but its sold out too bad was a cute idea not too thin for summer

for those of you that dont care for stretch jeans you would probably like these they feel like  cotton but better no stretch at all which im glad im not a fan of the stretch to me these are those comfy goto jeans i got my usual size  which i perfer in these because i can use the pockets with ease the pockets are lower side pocket which are great you will likely need to hem them unless you are pretty tall i hemmed mine and you cant tell it im not sure how much these could be
this top is beautiful soft and silky and hangs in a very flattering manner i am usually a  but sized up to an  to get a little more length it drapes really nicely i wear it with skinny jeans and a long necklaces for a casual puttogether look or it can be dressed up easily too im not sure what the previous reviewer meant about the neckline it lays perfectly on me highly recommend
i was able to try this on in store thanks to a return it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind even on sale i this wasnt worth the price for me the highlow hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me if this is something you can get mileage out of i really do recommend it well made lovely colors and nice style
have only tried on but it is a very cute skirt and i think will be comfortable to wear i love the texture of the material i do wish it came in other colors it is a little heavier material but not too much
this skirt is a great staple i somewhat agree with the first reviewer that it is a little big but not huge i bought a m which is my regular size and i have to have it shorten the length but that is typical for me since i am very short but i liked the waist and didnt feel like it was too big and i have a very small waist i dont like tight elastic at the waist and this sat very comfortably on me nice heavy material for the winter
so happy with this top i love the fabric the colors and the flowy fit  definitely recommend
like the other reviewer i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores i tried both the medium and the small usually at retailer i wear a medium however this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers making my bottom look bumpy when i tried on the small the dress fit and flattered me perfectly by far the best dress i ever owned i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing fo
"i was pleasantly surprised when i received this top in the mail i expected the top to be more of a tee shirt but it is very soft and more like a light sweater i feel the sizing is truetosize but the design is not meant to be close to the body for me the shoulders and length were perfectthis top is all about the sleeves matador perhaps but it was the sleeves that attracted me to this sweater i will wear with with a vest skinny jeans and booties"
not sure what to think i had great plans for this dress
this dress is the best of all worlds sophisticated modern and flattering i was surprised that the dress is actually two separate pieces a navy blue slip and a bold magenta lace overlay which will be perfect going into fall and the holiday season i had two babies backtoback and am not back to my prebaby shape but i was pleased to see how flattering this dress was i will be wearing it to a wedding in a couple of weeks and i know i will feel comfortable and confident in it
i was so excited to get this top and while it is soooo amazingly soft i still could not keep it i must admit that i am only  so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this but i felt like a matador which is definitely not what i was going for maybe if your tall and lean this would work  but for me no way
this is a beautiful dress and my husband agrees im   and the xs was long on me and a bit baggy on top i looked in to having it taken up but i think that will be hard to do without damaging much of whats elegant about the dress i hope that someone with more curves and a bit more height is able to enjoy this one
this turtleneck is already wrapped and its soon going under the tree for me i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on its fitted but not too tight or snug just fitted and flattering the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple  both for dress and casual ill wash it carefully just in case it seems well made but id hate to snag the lace
this is such a cool topsweater i like simple designs with a twist and the sleeves add that great with skinnies and heels
i do not think this dress runs large i think it it is true to size i am usually a size  and a  definitely curvy and tall at  the large was perfect for my bust i ordered a med also and it looks really narrow in the waist length is below knees as pictured i was finding that the zipper under left arm is very catchy i even checked the med and it is worse that concerns me but love the dress so i am keeping the large length is so hard i hardly ever find a dress the hits a little

it is a very pretty bra light weight and beautiful lace however i have yet to find a tback that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out to me it ran small i now know to get a  instead i am working on losing weight perhaps that might help with the fit
really fun comfortable pants i havent worn them yet as its hot here but i cant wait i tried them on with wedge sandals  a lacey bohemian top and they looked awesome i also tried them on with white rocker booties and my vintage t that says italians do it better and a jean jacketim loving the look  feel of them bring on the cool autumn days
i do wish this came in a  sizing purchased he  and it fits though the band is looser than desired i am still keeping it i love the back will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear recommend
this is an adorable top but it just wasnt my style im  and felt silly wearing a big bow but if you can rock this look id recommend it the top is a thin sweatshirt material not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric it is a cotton rayon blend the sweatshirt part is cropped but the striped shirt details come to a good length the shirt trim is  cotton the fit was true to size it is a bit loose not overly fitted but true to size it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar
i own many of the natori feathers back close bras and decided to try the front close version for springsummer tops and dresses i purchased the yellow and got the matching hipsters panty i no longer see the yellow available but you could find elsewhere or maybe retailer will bring this color back it is lovely for sizing i tried my normal size  and the cup size larger per other reviews the  did end up fitting better so i also recommend going up a cup size excited for warmer weather
i would buy these in every color theyre incredibly soft and stylish and feel like wearing pjs in public
this top makes me feel like the artist i am its so beautifully embroidered and detailed i wear it with cords or jeans and it never gets boring it was worth every penny
i love this shirt and have received compliments each time that ive worn it there is a lot of visual interest from the vibrant colors stitching and mesh panel on the back and it is a great transitional piece from late summer to fall and into winter my only complaint is that the threads pull easily and there are no laundering instructions so i had to log in to the website to learn that it was machine washable i would definitely recommend using a lingerie bag washing on delicate and not pu
i loved this top so much that i ended up purchasing it in another color it works with so many different outfits both casual and dressy it is super comfortable and so soft i would definitely recommend it
i love everything about this dress the style fit colors and design of fabric quality and feel of fabric so happy and highly recommend

such a pretty blouse drapes nicely though it is a little on the large side i got my usual medium and had to fix the straps a few times but a fun summer top that makes you feel super feminine maybe i could have sized down but i got it online on clearance so i didnt have the chance to try on another size still love it
"just received this in black and am in love it has a stevie nicks vibe and i look forward to wearing it as a swimsuit cover up dress with black slip underneath and even with a black tank and skinny jeans it really is beautiful i am  and was worried it would be too long but it just hits above ground with flats and will work even better with wedgesit is big and will flatter a variety of sizes even though im a  i dont feel like its too overwhelmingmy only concern is how"
this is such a fun happy dress i saw it in the store on the rack that has online returns so there was only one available to try on it was a size  and i usually wear a  in retailer brands i loved the dress and tried it anyway and it fit perfectly which is why i think it runs a bit large  for reference i am  and  lbs hourglass shape but a bit fluffy in the tummy and upper arms it has an empire waistline and a zipper in the back it is so light and airy and super comfortable it ha
lovely summer top comfortable and cool for hot summer days beautiful fabric fits tts highly recommend
i rarely buy anything at full price at retailer but after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i couldnt handle the thought of not having this dress in my life im  feet tall and a size  so this was definitely a maxi on me but there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats im very pearshaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shoppingclothing add
being a  i was nervous about the gaping between the top two buttons given the other reviews i read theyre right  it totally gaps even when standing still so i took it to the tailor they sewed the seam between the top two buttons easy fix for a blouse that otherwise works the color is great i got the red one and i like the fabric i didnt think it hit awkwardly at the bottom seam looks great with skinny white jeans
i got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it really nice flow and not tent like at all   and in a size  i dont find this shows my stomach at all its really comfortable and i love the colors i did get this in store at  off and i think its a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount
i was hesitant to order these especially because they didnt have a petite since theres shipping and i thought i might have to return them i know that most shorts from retailer run a little big im usually a  but in retailer bottoms  i ordered the  regular since there were no petites theyre not too high waisted i think they could have gone higher but theyre not low either love them theyre so fun and i cant wait to break them out
i love this dressi have it in the other color black and white but now i see this color scheme and i think i may actually like this one better i love the wider stripes near the waistline which gives it a slimming appearance the knotted look gives this dress a beachy feel which gets me in the mood for summertime i love that the pattern is bold but the color scheme allows this dress to still stay in the casual category and still be insanely flattering i love that i could wear this dress eve

this dress looks so beautiful on the model and i couldnt resist ordering it online i have an athletic build  read small hips  straight im  and  lbs i was very disappointed when i put on its made for a curvy build the dress was just too big especially around the hips i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build
i loved the lavender color on the cape it was soft and comfortable but the design on the front ruined it for me it took me all of  minute to know it was going back it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that it just wasnt my style at all i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights it looked more subdued in the photo its not i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an
i am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered but i still dont think it would have worked the fabric is very soft but thats where its qualities for me ended the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips for reference im  and  hourglass   the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it
i saw these shorts while leaving the store and immediately went back to the register to add them to my wardrobe they fit me true to other cartionnier clothing im   lbs and took a size  there is a significant amount of stretch in them but do not grow as the day goes on the colors are bright and fun without looking juvenile
let me start by saying i was not in the market for a new dress i bought this because it was retailer day and because in my seasoned experience as an online shopper this many positive reviews is rare so id better listen up and because i really like the other bailey  dress i own wow i am glad i made the impulse decision to buy this i love it my husband loves it and its comfy for reference i did size down and went with a petite had i not i think the dress would look on me like it does on
i recommend this dress because it is beautiful stylish and well made even though it did not work for me i tried the small and extra small the first  way too big lengthwise hit my knees as well as in the shoulders  the latter to tight across the chest  not for me but worth a try i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length
i have athletic calves from running so i really struggle with straightskinny jeans but these fit me just fine and dont look like jeggings i think the slit helps i have a  inseam and these hit just above the ankle great find  especially on sale
this is a very fitted dress i love it and it is very comfortable but might only be appropriate for date night as it really hugs curves there is a lining of the same material underneath that holds you in a little i think it could go with a lot of different shoes and you could dress it up or down with jewelry jacket even a large sweater over the top tts i definitely would not recommend sizing down im a  and the med is right for me

"i ordered this top in  colors because i thought it would be great with leggings i always love my retailer purchases but this fell a little short i think it may be the type fabric it is but the way the back hangs so low on my frame  it doesnt drape nicely over my leggings the style of the top is very cute and maybe if i wanted it for skinny jeans it would be ok i returned them both to the storethis is one that would be better to try on first"
i love wearing this so much i wear it with leggings jeans and i also like to pair it with is a long linen skirt that i have i purchased it in plum and then went back for a second in moss i got them before they went on sale for fear theyd be out of my size i am very happy with my purchase i highly recommend
i have never looked good in a legging stretchy denim jeggings are usually the most i can get away with but i am amazed how flattering these are the fit is great i got a m cause im small but curvy in my hipsbutt the material is thick enough not to reveal too much and the faux pocket in the back does a lot to make one feel less exposed the length seems like it would be a great compromise between short and tall girls too  im pretty short but they arent too long on me theres a ve
"i just tried it on and it fits well with no extra room it seems like a nice fall piece to have in your wardrobe the color leans more towards green now i have to figure out what to put on top when i wear iti think it will be cute with boots"
love this skirt  i purchased the chino skirt during the summer and wore it weekly  this skirt is the fall equivalent  flattering and true to size  there is some stretch to it so its very comfortable  highly recommend
lovely feel to this almostcowl neck turtleneck its quite thin and has  length sleeves so it wont keep you warm but the fabric is soft the ribbing is flattering and the fit is loose without feeling frumpy overall a good staple thats a bit more interesting the mauveish color looks great with grays
this sweater is thick and does cover the bra well i did not find it to be well made the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering
i purchased this tank in white the material is very soft but it is very thick which i was surprised by but i still like it the fit is a little boxy i have an xxsp and it fits a little large hangs perfectly  just like the photo i almost sent it back just because of the boxy look but i think i make it work this summer going to keep it
"bought this dress online in my usual  for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress surprisingly they had  as well so i reordered that one and love it keep in mind that the style is very subdued and elegant especially from the front with a little bit of fun added to the back with the"
i love this top its classic and classy but with a fun update being a henley the gingham is super cute the texture of the fabric is really nice and soft and thick it is fully lined i plan to layer it for winter and cant wait to pair it with white capris come spring i bought my usual size xs and its a little snug at the hips where im more curvy but perfect overall highly recommend
this is one of those dresses that hides on the rack until you see it and you think hmmm this is really interesting and then you try it on and all the ladies in the dressing room say whoa yep this is that dress much more fitted and flattering on my   frame it oddly kind of alludes to  caftans very cool
the design of this dress is very cute but if you have an average to large bust dont even think about it returned unfortunately
best beachy summer tunic in the store can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight can be worn over jeans shorts a bathing suit take your pick wear it with a tankcami underneath or not it works wither way asymmetrical cut great for us longlegged tall people fabulous buy only con is that its a tad delicate unfinished hem and looseknit will easily snag if you arent mindful i recommend hand wash air dry
ive rarely met a maeve item i didnt like initially looking at this dress i thought it was suede but its a structured cotton making it a little more stiff than id like i feel that making it suede wouldve been perfect for this dress i am   lbs usually a  i tried on the  and it was a great fit except for the chest area  and the butthips area making this dress a little less shift and a little baggy in the abdominal region i then tried on the  and it was way too big all a
this is a very comfortable bralette the silk covers ones most sensitive parts so it feels like you are wearing almost nothing its very pretty too i wear a  bra and the small fits me it doesnt have a lot of support but its very comfortable for wearing at home or on errands the cups are a little far apart but it still works if youre looking for something pretty and comfortable for casual wear i would recommend this at the sale price
this has a unique style and feel to the fabric which i like however the color is not orange as advertised its more or a reddish pink tone which was somewhat disappointing because orange is what i was looking for i will still keep it to pair with other outfits in mind

i purchased this dress in my usual petite size  it fit me quite well for the most part a bit tight around the armpit area but the major issue for me was with the front of the dress there was a weird pocket of extra fabric under my chest area im small chested also the bow across the back did not cover my bra strap below the bow which made me think i needed to size up im not sure if that would have fixed the weird fit in the front but i just decided to return the dress in the end the
i ordered this dress in a size  im  and  i usually wear size  but the  fit beautifully the material has a nice stretch to it so that i think it would still fit whether i gained or loss  lbs when i pulled it out of the box i immediately thought it read grandma but was pleasantly surprised when i put it on it is snug in the waist and flares out nicely from there it hits me on the knee exactly as it does the model in the picture i plan on wearing this maybe for christma
absolutely beautiful dress i bought a size  and found it tts i typically buy  in retailer dresses the print is gorgeous i am a sucker for anything with poppies and i love the silky material hugs your curves and flows nicely i was worried the torso would be too long based on prior reviews and because i am of short torso but it fits well would definitely recommend
"i absolutely love the fit of these jeans they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips they are fitted and look nice with boots but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material legging material while comfortable typically feels thin but these do not and they are quite warmthe one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs i have had these pants for about  months now and i have washed them and have hang dried them about  times i have neve"
i ordered this dress online and am struggling to decide about whether to keep it the fabric is soft and comfortable and has a more casual look the dress makes my boobs look awesome but doesnt do much for the rest of my body the main reason im on the fence about keeping it are that im not sure if i would wear it to work the slit goes up fairly high and the fit draws attention to my bust i think that i would love it for casual wear in the summer but i prefer to invest in dresses that are
i love love love this dress i am   and got an xs its just barely small on me but works great it looks amazing and i cant always wear maxi dresses they dont always work with my body type this one is perfect the color is gorgeous i highly recommend this dress
just bought this jacket on sale and i love it its like a soft compfy sweatshirt  love the longer length i feel like it runs pretty true to size i usually buy an xs or small and the small fit fine the sleeves are a tad long but not too bad the model has them scrunched up but i find they are too snug to do that i would highly recommend this jacket just love the feel and look of it

i was really excited for this dress to come and hoped it would work well for a couple of holiday parties that i will be going to this season i wasnt sure what i thought when trying it on but i am thinking it will go back since i still am not super excited about it for me the waistline was a bit high and it had a bit of a frumpy feel i love the floral pattern but overall it just wasnt amazing
i feel in love when i tried it on im  an usually have to hem long dresses  but this on fits perfectly its full length on me its shorter on the model but i think it looks better full length and its a gorgeous burgundy soft and comfortable cant wait to wear it

i ordered this because it looked to be a good fit for my casual lifestyle and it doesnt disappoint its cozy lightweight but warm flows well and looks great tied or worn loose i ordered my regular size large in the grey it fits as shown just a bit longer because im short the color is more of a blue gray with white striations that are well placed its really striking for such a casual piece very pretty highly recommend
this sweater runs true to size i am  and  lbs and ordered the small it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle it is a well made heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm if you like the feel of wool buy it if not pass on it
this skirt is so cute highly recommend super easy to dress up or to dress down it isnt shown as well in the picture but it has really intricate and pretty detailed stitching throughout the skirt i have gotten so many compliments on it random people have even stopped to tell me how much they like it and where they can find it it runs a little small so i recommend buying it a size up also if youre taller like me it is a little short in the back overall a great buy

this sweater is beautiful but runs big i got the xs   and its very roomy i love the thickness the color the pockets and even the roominess except for the sleeves they are very long and very wide which makes it look bulky if sleeves were slimmer it would look like a cute intentionally oversized style instead i look like a kid who borrowed a giant sweater i think it would work better on a taller slim person but i still like it
i dont think they are an easy fit cut they are more like skinny jeans as i was looking for something more relaxed i decided to return them the quality of the material is good the color is nice
"i ordered this because the reviews were outstanding i am returning it although the embroidery looks fine on screen in person it looks cheap and tacky moreover the high ruffled neck goes a step too far  into overthetop victorian cutesyoverpriced to bootobviously mine is a minority opinion"
i bought the delaney blazer in size   and i really like it there are surprising design elements which make it a unique piece  the buttons of the sleeves are mismatched the back material is different from the front it has some exposed seams like others have said it does have a boxy fit  which i dont mind i also found it to be a bit short if both of these things are fine for you the blazer is a great addition to a casualcreative professional look
i bought a suit similar to this last year and loved it this year i bought the pineapple print and it is beautiful size  it is classysexy i have a long torso so i like that it covers me better than most one piece swim suits i try on i highly recommend this product
material was a tad rough for my liking the color did nothing for my olive complexion given the price of this shirt even with  off i dont think its worth it if im spending  on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this onegoing back
"i ordered both colors in different sizes xs and xxs  petite were no longer available so cant compare therecolor i liked the black better for these reasons color can be worn yearround just add a nice jacket or cardigan and ok for winter season ivory was kind of seethroughsize xxs fit me better the xs was wider and bigger arm holessadly the xxs was the ivory so i didnt keep either of themref  lbs   in wasit"
i bought this earlier in the summer in size xl ive gotten such good use out of it the fit on me matches the model the details of the crochet lace add such a nice touch not your typical hoodie but just the same comfort ive washed in cold in my machine  air dried it hasnt shrunk one of my favorite purchases perfect for chilly weather or when you go into ac areas would love this in other colors great piece
i wanted to get a couple tops for date nights that went well with skinny jeans and this hit the mark as mentioned before this top is translucent and thus would recommend using a cami as well however the embroidery is beautiful i have not had it cleaned yet and thus cannot comment on the durability cant wait to wear it out

i am absolutely in love with this bathing suit and i want it in every color possible i bought the black one last year and wore it all summer as no other suit that i already owned could compare i get compliments on it every where i go its flattering comfy and its a one piece that doesnt make me feel frumpy buy this suit
perfect fit though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami i absolutely recommend this shirt it fits tts
i love this coverup it does feel big when you first put it on however you just pull on the strap and tie it to your liking i am  so this hits a little lower than on the model in the picture but it does not drag on the floor this is my new favorite coverup now all i need is the sun
i bought this top for my sisters birthday so the review is based on her opinion she loved it and told me the embroidery was beautiful she said it was tts she also stated that the blouse was so versatile and could be worn dressed up or down
such a beautiful pattern  i think you could wear it with a skirt and it wouldnt even read as a bathing suit love the lacy pattern in front great fit i bought a medium when i usually wear a small in retailer it fits a little loose so id probably buy a small if i bought another one but it all depends on how you like your suits to fit
im an xl in retailer tops and the xl in this blouse fit wonderfully i bought the blouse in black but will also probably purchase it in the cream the blouse is made very nicely however i had to deal with about  embroidered pieces that were not knotted i had to take a needle and thread the loose pieces to the back of the blouse and then knot them in with the rest of the embroidery some of the individual flowers just came out entirely however this is such a stunning blouse and i feel so g
delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness loved the unmatched buttons checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy easyily dress it up or down that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build ordered a  but i think a  would have been perfect
"i bought this in june on a sale and am so glad that i did its so pretty and classy the neck has stretch so its not tight at all its styled like a swing top but it really isnt there isnt much of a fabric abundance to this although it is loose and cool i bought an xl which is my usual size and the fit is finethere are  layers of fabric i do not think a cami is needed at alli bought this in black and the floral embroidery just pops im just not a white fan due to cleani"
simply perfect i ordered the white floral maillot in a large   pounds and it is so comfortable and flattering that i do not want to take it off the colors are so vibrant and accurate which is great considering not all internet item photos are the same in person i do recommend ordering a size up  the medium was snug but definitely remember that your suit shrinks when wet now that they have a new print  hello fish  i really really want another
very pretty top but like the other reviewers saidthe neck is very itchy i live in florida and i dont think i can wear this during the summer unless i get the neck lined i got an xxs p which was a little shorter than i would have liked so i am returning for xxs
the embroidery is breathtaking it is more flattering and interesting in person i would highly recommend it it is true to size figure flattering and unique the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece this is it
i have a large cup size and year after year i am in the search of the perfect suit that supports but doesnt look matronly this year i had a baby and wanted to move to a one piece but still wanted to feel sexy and youthful i thought there is no way this suit is going to look good andor support a  but gave it try because of all the  star reviews i tried it on and my husband just said wow this suit hugs you in all the right places and actually supports  i dont know how but it doe
i fell in love with this dress online i listened to the reviews and ordered a size up i got it in the mail and couldnt wait to try it on i was sad that to find that while it was tight across the chest and the keyhole in the back seemed to pull it was really large in the body in addition while the lace is beautiful it is very fragile i still think this is a great dress but definitely for someone who is small chested for reference i am a  and size  and i ordered a medium
i thought this is nice when it was a new arrival i put it in my wish lsit as i liked how the cut looked on the modl but i dindt think i would love it as much on me i ordered it when it hit sale the material is fluffy and has a shimmer you cant see on the online picture one of hte thread will need to be cut but no biggie it is so ute the beading is also very subtle but pretty my stylist brught it in t try onin the store loved it somuch she is ordering one for herself the cut i
this top was always on my wait for sale list now it is and i had to pass i love the look on other people the laec up is super cute and trendy but the cut was just too big on me it left me blah i think if you are tall and are looking for a nice white shirt then go for it it looks so nice half tucked with skinny jeans
this is such a unique piece and could be dressed up or down i can see myself wearing this with skinny jeans and a tee and adding a statement necklace or wearing over a dress i tend to get hot so i like how light weight this is even though it is lined it is of excellent quality but may run slightly small or at least smaller than other items i have purchased through retailer the drape is extremely flattering and i think that would be true for every figure my favorite feature is the oversized
the cheshire dress is lovely the fit is true to size and the quality is awesome i love the way the sleeves lay on my shoulders i would definitely recommend this dress
"this duster is light weight  good for a inside a chilly restaurant but not really warm enough for cold outdoor winter weatherreally punches up a black on black outfit polished artsy interesting look runs large has a feel similar to a swing coat  with less swingive received many compliments on this piece wear it with confidence  it is on the bold side"
"an odd topfor my curvy figure  the seam did not enhance but rather made me look widerthe material isinteresting foamlike is all i can think to describe it the fabric and design are not as elegant looking in person"
i love this top because the gold dots add a bit of bling to your otherwise average slouchy tshirt i didnt notice that the dots are actually distressed until i got the shirt and then looked closer at the online pictures worry not they are supposed to be that way and do not peel off the sizing is a bit odd but i assumed that it corresponded to xssml so i ordered my usual xs  size and it worked out just right im giving this shirt an overall of  stars instead of  because this shirt
"i saw this in the sales section today and was drawn to it by the color and style i really didnt think itd fit on me even though the only size available was a size  because it looked like a sheathtype dress thats more body hugging and usually such dresses just dont work well on my wider hips and hourglass frame howeverl heres what i thoughtpros beautiful blush pink it looks exactly the same in person as online very comfortable as the other reviewer mentioned t"
i have had my eye on this dress since the spring in yellow but it sold out quickly i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely i will be wearing this dress for family photos the lace and the details are so very pretty i am usually a size  or  and purchased in size  since there is no stretch to it it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it wish it came in white
love the simple nonfussy style of this dress note that the color is not ivory as described and expected not the first time retailer makes that mistake however i still found the oatmealishwarm beige color to be flattering to my skin tone warm tones look best on me like that the shoulders are covered while still feeling sleeveless gives it a dressier feel the fine texture is lovely this does drape up top while the bottom clings a bit but not overly much for me to feel immodest i am

ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight the coat has an odd shape  not a line or straight the medium was large on me the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges sadly this coat will be returned
this reminds me of a kimono or poncho rather than a cardigan but that aside its a beautiful sweater the feel of it is luxurious and is soft and comfortable i would size down at least one size im usually a medium to large and i bought the small i gave this piece  stars because it is a touch boxy its seems like a piece ill throw on with jeans and wear to a casual dinner in the fall definitely a fallwinter item
i wanted to love this turtleneck i read the reviews before ordering i love the color the weight of the knit the ribbing the small fit me perfectly i am a  not broad shouldered and on the thin side in my upper body however this item has a strange blousy fit the picture of the back view hints at this but its worse in person its like a bell shaped top or even slightly trapezey which simply doesnt work with my shape plus im long waisted i could have made this work had it not
i love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin not as great so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished
this is a very pretty blouse with a vintage romantic looking fabric the tiny pleats near the neck and shoulders are lovely i love the colorsblack brown and cream its hard to find a top that can be worn well with both black and brown the long tie adds a romantic feel this blouse is totally sheer so requires a cami or tank i actually love the blouse but returned it because it is super blousy i am   lbs and the small was fine it is just so blousy that even belting it didn
love the color love the design at the hem this top runs wide im still deciding whether to keep this as i think the wide hem may be somewhat flattering on me
it took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while i wasnt sure about the color then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers which i had just purchased and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it i love the fit and feel of this top i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice my only wish is that t was a touch longer
i am superpleased with this cardigan which is at a terrific sale price i saw this in the pink color in the state street retailer in chicago and i loved the feel of the material but wasnt sure about the color for me when i saw they had a neutral striped version online i decided to get it the material is very soft and the beigeneutral color has a gray undertone which is good for my skintone the front is doublelayered and it has a fun seaming detail in the back and an unfinished trim whi
its hard to tell how jeans will fit when shopping online i was very pleasantly surprised they are super soft very high quality and look even better in person im   lbs and i ordered the  and may have to get them taken up an inch but they fit perfectly through the hips and come in at the knee im big in the hips and small in the waist and they fit perfectly highly recommend for petites out there
there was only a l in store but i tried it as a gauge given i am normally a  i knew it was going to be too big but wanted to see if i could get an idea of how it might look in my regular size it truly is a lovely blouse  gauzy fabric flowy feel and an easy piece to dress up or down however the xs was much shorter in the sleeves above the wrist bone on me and much shorter in the body sat at mid pelvis  for ref i am  this completely altered the look and i think i would have

i highly recommend this top i am busty and was concerned that it might not be flattering but i find it flattering i also dont have the greatest arms so i wore a crisp white top underneath see my pics below hides any tummy pooch and is so flattering runs tts i ordered a small im   lbs the petite might have been too short for my taste dont hesitate
i bought this dress in the green color and i am absolutely in love with it it is very figure flattering and looks great even though i have a larger bust it is also a great length hits about an inch or two above the knee highly recommend
this top is very comfortable and really cute on the material is super soft i bought the white and am very happy with it but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it i would definitely recommend
i saw this online and thought the idea was super cute but was not sure if it would be worth the money because it looks typical but when i went to the store to try it on i saw it was anything but typical the fit is perfect and the fabric so soft i wanted the dress in the green but they were already sold out in my size at the store so i had to order it online i cannot wait until it comes in i will wear this often during the summer
this top is really cute the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top i was afraid it might make it too stiff  bulky around the shoulders but it doesnt very cute the armholes are cut on the bigger side but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anythingjust comfortable the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming runs pretty tts i ordered my usual medium and its not quite as form fitting
"i love this dress its cool and comfortable in this crazy heat the fabric has a great feel to it i do wish it was just a little longer im   and bought a medium"
this is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days its a fallwinterspring staple for sure its very soft and falls perfectly i would definitely recommend it
this dress might be the most comfortable article of clothing i own especially for the hot summers it is attractively loose and so light that you barely feel like you are wearing it love it
i love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown tneck and straight leg pants i get a lot of compliments on it i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick the color is true to what is shown the fit is perfect and what i expected i highly recommend the purchase
im    jeans size  dress one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on the sleeves are no joke  serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots but is surprisingly chic the one i purchased was a medium  never had an opportunity to try a small which i suspect is my actual size buying it oversized made this magical it feels modern i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me it makes the sleeves less cartoonish
this is my favorite dress purchase so far in  the fabric feel and thickness is wonderful it flares out a little but not too much order the size that matches your largest measurement on the size chart for bust and waist  or if you have broad shoulders the larger of your typical size range im typically a  or a  with a  hip measurement a middle range  is   is  waist measument  and a  bust measurement but my shoulders are broad and athletic  the larger
i have been looking for a summer dress with a bit of a chic flair to it i was thinking black tank top dress after weeks of hunting for the idea in my head i started to branch out i reluctantly tried this on thinking it would be baggish plain and possibly too short wow was i wrong this dress is everything  more wear with some wedges belt it although it doesnt need it at all layer a high neckline lace top over it the possibilities are endless although i loved the green the b
i like this coat especially the collar and cuffs but the buttons were too eyecatching for me i wanted something more subtle still i recommend the coat
completely versatile and absolutely perfect for days when my pea coat is too heavy looks amazing with jeans or with slacks for work i highly recommend this jacket
saw this in the store and had to have it i got the green because its different i am typically a  or xs in most dresses sometimes a small i bought the small in this dress until i realized it was a little too loose if you like that look the small could have worked toothe xs didnt look like a bag on me and could be dressed with a belt for a more fitted look i like the knee length and fabric is super soft definitely recommend
very unflattering and no shape or flair lots of extra material but no swing or shape do not recommend
i love the idea of this top but there is just way too much fabric involved in person im  and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering i feel like they could have made about  shirts out of it i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back the silhouette is nothing like shown if there were just less fabric i wo

received this yesterday wearing it today and am happy   warm and cozy  perfect blend of sweatshirt and sweater for when you want to be comfortable yet still look like you tried   and  lbs i ordered an xs and  still pretty roomy which is how i think  supposed to fit i would prefer it to be a little more form fitting but not enough to send back  great with skinny jeans and boots
i love this shirt i ordered a medium and the sleeves were very long and the shirt was wide in general i returned it for a small and it is perfect size down i love the comfy gauzy feel of this shirt
i bought this top in all colors as i love it so much it is lightweight and perfect for our hothumid summers i actually wear the top backwards because the front of the top is longer that the back to me it looked stranger to have it longer in the front size wise i think this top runs pretty large i am usually a medium in most tops sometimes a small and i purchased this in a small petite it fits great i even tried on the xs petite and while it still fit in armpits and chest it was just
for me a good pencil skirt makes me feel so ladylike i love eva franco pencils but be warned they are designed to be a tight fit through the tush i wear a  and i ordered the  in this skirt the pouch another reviewer pointed out seems intended to be a pocket but because the skirt fits me pretty snugly it doesnt stick out when i walk and sit the fabric does seem like it would snag easily so ill choose accessories thoughtfully for reference i have a  waist and  hips
i keep trying to find a peplum that works for me but so far i have been unsuccessful i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well togetheraside from the peplum issue this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large the material alone is thick making it a bulkier shirt then add the volume of the peplum and i looked and felt huge needless to say this one was returned sale or no sale

i recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shownand is actually a nice touch to make these different  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips  i wear a  and the l is fine but i wouldnt want them any smaller  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute
alright so i really love this shirt but i am having it taken in to fit me i weigh  and am  foot  and pretty petite and this shirt is too big on me and i got an xs i didnt wanna get xxs and am glad i didnt because i think it would be too short im going to keep the shirt but it is too big on me it puffs out in the front and some in the back when you stand certain ways and i need to have it taken in or else it isnt as flattering as it should be the material is awesome and i love
"cant say enough about these pantsi often find leggings to be to revealing when wearing them with long but not long enough top i have a longer torso so finding tops that hit this sweet spot is an issue for me i also dont love long flowy tops with jeans all the time the portions look all off and i look and feel heavy in my middle sectioncue these darlings with out any buttons zippers on the front your shirts will lay flat and crisp i feel comfortable and appropriate at my causal work o"

" im  tall  lbs and      and the medium fit me well my only problem is that the collar keeps falling to the back i feel like the shoulder isnt cut right to sit on the shoulder i seem to have this problem a lot with this brand where the shirt just wants to fall to the back"
just bought red today to wear to a conference to stay warm over floreat peasant blouse and pilcro serif jeans love love very flattering and plan to wear with skirts on airplanes for warmth and for travel very versatile  highly recommend 
as is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter in terms of fit i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build  it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics at   with a very small

love a gray sweater and this one is stunning layered with a plaid tunic and worn to work with many compliments the only downside is the poncho shape with the large wing like sleeves makes it impossible to wear a coat over this sweater if you wanted to wear in the winter cold you would need a cape also not an ideal piece if you need to lift your arms for any reason keeping that in mind though i still really like it for days when i want to look cute and wont be dont a ton of moving aro
this top is beautiful but the fabric is really stiff and itchy in addition its rather cropped or short the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it the tag recommends dry cleaning but allows for hand washing i should have dry cleaned  it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold too bad because this looks so cute the first time you wear it if youre up for a dry cleaning bill and dont mind a little stiff scratchy material youll be fine buying t
i initially bought this in the stone color and loved it so much the first time i wore it that i went back for the red without a doubt my favorite purchases of the season have gotten so many compliments on both and despite the fact that the style isnt form fitting it is still somehow very flattering would highly recommend this sweater to anyone
these jeans are so great im thinking of getting a second pair for when the first wear out despite the price they hug my curves and make me feel like a bombshell the fabric and stitching is all good quality and sturdy  these are comfy but they definitely are not thin like legging jeans love them
i bought this in rose and i really like the jacket the color is not rose but the picture is accurate it is more terra cotta as previous reviewers said it is pretty casual but you can dress it up with a chunky necklace and dressy boots i do wish it was a tad more fitted in the waist i think it looks better buttoned but i do wear it open as well
i bought this in purple and then just now in navyi love the sleeve length and neckline this shirt is made of a very soft knit material a so its very comfy and flattering goes well with jeans shirts and shorts i definitely recommend purchasing this shirt
im pretty flatchested  so its hard for me to say how the sizing runs on this top for others to me its a slim fitting but not tight true to size tshirt i tried the xs regular dressing room photo and the small petite other photo and id say the main fit difference was in the shoulders the small petite fit me better in the shoulders xs petite wasnt available also the neckline of the small petite came up a little higher the white is a slightly dingy offwhite but i think the
i love ponchos and the colors are gorgeous but the pictures make it look much longer than it is i wouldve loved it if i were petite but i personally dont think its meant for taller people such a shame
nice fit wish it was a little longer but i really do like it and feel good when i wear it
i love this i bought it in the red color in person it is a deeper color than it looks online and it has some flecks of lighter yarn in it that just add to its beauty it is very soft and cozy it is warm without being hot i typically wear a smallsometimes medium at retailer i bought a medium only because i wanted it to be a little longer so that i could wear it with leggings and feel comfortable i am  though so if you are shorter than you may not need to size up it looks great with a

a lovely creatively designed tunic that just isnt for me  the embroidery is certainly intricate and the chambray shirt has a wearable hand but the combination on my body type didnt look quite right probably because i am too top heavy and apple torsoed  i think if i were more slender the fit would look like a flattering dress  i had purchased the size  and i am  
i saw this online and decided to go to the store to have a look at it in person i was not disappointed at all it is so gorgeous i purchased the burgundy color and have received so many compliments it is very well made i am   lbs and purchased a small i think some others mentioned it falls short in back but on me it falls well passed my bottom maybe they purchased a petite
like another reviewer i initially passed by this sweater and thought nothing of it until i noticed it on display super cute and ultra comfy the kind of sweater that just beckons to be warn in the fall i purchased this in the olive color and just love it very cute and flattering for a ponchotype sweater i do think it runs a bit large so i sized down for the perfect fit i highly recommend this item

other than the color i got the rose color which is great i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough i am  and the sleeves come right to my wrists if not just a tad longer onto my hands its also got some stretch to it so it doesnt make you feel to stiff as you wear it you can move in it  its very comfortable and pretty

this sweater is beautiful especially in the bordeaux color the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves there really are no sleeves just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection or pushing the sleeves way up which then results in
this blouse makes me feel young vibrant and beautiful i got it in  colors with the coupon special i love how it fits and its slimming love it i have broad shoulders and it is very slimming
i love the quality of this little gem its going to be used as an under a sweater top and also to fill a vneck line dress up thats too low for me its made very well in my opinion but it runs a bit too full so if you are between sizes you could easily go down a size
when i put this skirt on my aunt said that looks like a skirt with class shes right this skirt feels as wonderful on as it looks i love the faux leather slash it is the perfect detail without detracting from a printed top i think it is great to just slip on no zipper for those daysi even pulled this on over a dress bailey  hits it out of the park again i have  dresses and now a skirt te colors on the website are brighter than they are in person just fyi
super cute pants fit and color just like model picture i fall between a  and  waist and all that was available was a  so i ordered it online however when they came it was just a bit too bigloose so i had to return them if i had been able to get just the right size maybe size own a bit if in questions i think i would have kept them
i had never worn pilcro jeans and i took a chance and ordered without trying them on i couldnt be more pleased i wear a  but it is often difficult to find a good fitting pair of jeans these fit comfortably and dont feel too tight but are fitted enough to look great i like the little bit of extra room around the top allowing the jeans to feel comfortable ill be back for more pilcro jeans

lately retailer tees have been misses for me but i was intrigued by the reviewers comments about the shaping of the tee to enhance the illusion of a waistline that drew me in because i have a short waist and some shaped tees just cling there and emphasize rolls more than my waist but not this one it is more fitted along the back waist and looser in the front i generally order size large in tees as i did with this one i dont think the fit is too big because its cut not to cling anywhere i h
i love this pair to add some color to a plain outfit however they ran just a tad bigger than i expected
they are really cute the fabric is a little stiff but the details are nice the waist seems big so i suggest sizing down i bought  p my usual size and sent them back for a  p because the waist was big
i snagged this top with the  off sale and its adorable i got the white and it goes great with some skinny jeans or tucked into a skirt i found it ran true to size my only complaint is that like some other reviewers have stated it does wrinkly very easily and i would say for full price i dont think the quality is worth the cost but on sale its a great shirt
this dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didmt work for me but if you dont mind layering or your bra peeking through its still a very beautiful dress im usually a petite in most things but this wasnt available in p so i ordered an xs the length was good not too long not too short but it was cut way too low for me on
"the photo of this dress does not do it justice this dress is absolutely gorgeous the construction is very high quality i always worry about peekaboos with button front dresses as i am very busty total nonissue with this dress the petite fit is also spot on it is slightly large in the back bodice for me but i always have that problem its an easy tailoring fixi think im in love with byron lars "
this dress is beautiful and unique but if you are more pear shaped get the correct size to fit your hips it fits very close through the behind but is stretchy as i was putting it on and felt it hugging me closely i thought it would never work  but when i looked in the mirror i found it looked quite nice even though it clings and the stretch allows plenty of movement if i size up to allow more room in the hips then i think it will be too loose on top so i will just wear it with spanx th
this is my third byron lars and as usual it is absolutely gorgeous and so worth the price it completely flatters the body and all the details add so much interest creating a very unique dress
love this top this is a very comfortable everyday top worn primarily with jeans please make it in more colors i think it should be less expensive
"surprisingly this poncho is both flattering and soft i must say i didnt think the fabric would be as soft since a lot of knits have wool but this is great  i purchased both xss and xss pthe petite was just slightly more fitted so i went with that i love the boat neck on me it gives the poncho an elegant look colors are nice and neutrali  think i will wear this with dresses and jeans both great purchase  lbs   in waist"

gorgeous dress colors as appear in picture thick material quality is good sizing im usually a size  or small got a small and it is big in the chest length is below the knee would recommend a size smaller than normal not a huge deal small alteration job
this dress is good quality but the designers today really need to design their clothing line with the busty woman in mind
i saw army green pants similar to this in the store but then found these on line and ordered them instead i love them they stretch out a bit so i am glad i sized down i could possibly have sized down even one more size i got a  the waist is very comfortable so maybe this is just the fitafter all they are basically stylish fatiques either way they are casual but on trend i have planned a ton of outfits in my head already because these pants will go with so much i think the cuff w
this is soo cute and definitely runs tts i ordered both the  and the  and ended up keeping the  i absolutley love this and i think it is unique and fun i plan to wear it on a vacation in a month
ive worn this twice now and got a ton of compliments on it its so comfortable and looks great the lavender color is gorgeous highly recommend
i ordered my normal size large and am sadly returning because its overly large and long on my frame the slight dolman sleeves are too long and wide and better suited for longer arms than mine love the pointelle sleeves they add a soft feminine vibe hard to tell from the photos but the texture is almost fuzzy  the gray color is beautiful and  its actually made from multi colored beige and gray that looks silver in the light it doesnt itch or shed i dont like it enough to try a smaller
i get the great reviews these do for me what no jogger could i have hips i never thought these would work they do and they look just as cool on me as the model i am a  i could only find a  but i think a  would be perfect they are effortlessly cool and casualfor all body types im so excited i tried these on
this is my fourth amadi piece from retailer  i love their signature fitted crossover top design which i am finding in many of their pieces like the lola jumpsuit crossfront lola dress and others  this dress has the same crossover top design with a slim maxi silhouette    the fabric is  rayon and  nylon with a neat texture that doesnt come through on the product photo but adds to its appeal in my opinion because it hides wrinkles  it fits tts and the same as the other amadi pie
this sweater was gorgeous however i think it was to boxy for my figure it had to go back as it was not flatteringi would recommend this product to someone with a taller slimmer figure im   lbs

i have many ponchos i think they are timeless fun and sophisticated and this one is definitely a nice addition to my wardrobe as many have mentioned the center of the poncho is off center however this does not detract from the beautiful pattern on this item i will enjoy wearing it with a tee or tank underneath this winter and fall great purchase
love this dress the description says pull over styling but its not there is a side zipper which i think makes for a better fit i bought a  which fit great im   lbs and it hits right above the knee
best bathing suit bottoms ever lowrise doesnt work forever and this bottom is perfect if you want a little more coverage without being too momish the ruching gives it a really cute retro feel as opposed to a granny panties feel my usual size small fits great and i definitely did not have the problem another reviewer did with it coming up past the belly button it hits me right where it hits the model in the photo i just wish they made it in more prints there are some really cute top

i ordered these in a medium and they fit but i wanted more coverage so i sized up i wear a  or  and i took the large the large isnt tight at all but the medium was i like my bottoms to have a lot of coverage and dont mind them a little big i like how much coverage they provide but still look feminine and cute
oh how i have searched for a midrise bottom that was not matronly and finally i have found one they cover just enough of the back without looking like my mothers bathing suit butt and the ruched sides add just enough interest to not be boring in a solid color and speaking of the color the blue is beautiful i am happy with these and hope they hold up for several years i am  lbs and the small fit perfect
i saw this jacket in the store and it looks and fit beautiful it fits tts and is forgiving to the curvy this is a staple piece to have during the fall or spring highly recommend
these are very stylish if you are short they are a little baggy at the bottom they are a bit overpriced i bought them before they went on sale good quality and feel light and airy
i love the concept of this dress i love the stripes ruffle hem and little cut up detail but it runs huge im   lbs and typically wear a  i went with the xs in this dress it flairs out significantly near the waist and hips which makes it super comfortable but not the most flattering i wish they had tapered it in slightly to give it a slightly more fitted look im keeping it and think it will be cute with booties in the fall but im not  on it
i cant wait for the milder weather to arrive so i can wear this tunic it is very stylish and elegant and one of those rare pieces that makes you feel good wearing it
this is a quirky whimsical uniquely designed top thats sure to get a lot of comments and opinions and hopefully good ones i really love it think it is what it is a fun conversation piece  and isnt that whats great about fashion tts very comfy yes boxy but i dont think in a bad way the ruffle on the bottom is adorable would look great with slim ivory or white denim and booties or even a darker denim hits mid bum nice quality too

these bottoms are super comfortable i think they run a little big for a small i bought another swimsuit from retailer and the bottoms are also small and fit a little better than these it goes well with the peplum swimsuit top im so excited about wearing them this season
cute tee its a casual tee with some nice detailing that gives it some style the fabric is a good thickness not seethrough thin but light enough for warm weather the color should match pretty much anything nice neckline i think it runs slightly large i hover between a small extra small with tops and the xs fit nicely i do have narrow shoulders  so women with normal to wide shoulders might prefer their usual size i dont expect people to gush over it with compliments but it it a
cute top great for the inner maid marian fan  fun twist on tshirt in regular size also ordered the alexandria top in somewhat similar vein but didnt care for that one at all this one was cute and the fit is flattering the other is boxy and boring to me recommend this one
"wow i didnt think this dress would work on my curvy frame i still have a baby belly and some dresses look like mumus on me this was so flattering the waist cinches nicely and the length is just above the knee i am  and  for reference the weight its lightcottony and it looks great with flats and wedges love it"
this dress is the absolute best it is comfy flattering cute  pretty much the best dress ever as a previous reviewer said ti is a   even   season dress throw it on with boots and a wool cardi in the winter and youre all set i didnt even think twice about buying it perfect length a little longer in the back but not too short in the front and i do not like short dressesskirts dont think about it just buy

i really liked this dress the tie defines the waist and the skirt volume is flattering one minor concern i had was the dress is a bit thin although the skirt is lined i think this will be a great summer in fall transition piece
"this dress is elegant and really lovely it looks like a throwback to the  and  it drapes nicely and i think it would be flattering on most body types and this is why i am recommending it but be warned it runs largethe problem with the dress is that the slip might as well not be there at allit is completely sheer for example i have a couple tattoos and you can see them right through the fabric which is not the look im going for this might be a deal breaker for some for me i"
this dress is an absolute win i was won over on the hanger by the linen fabrics lightweight nature and then i tried it on such a good fit for my high waist and the tie was super flattering i love this with booties as i was wearing today but think it will be adorable with espadrilles as well for a more summery look its also the rare three season dress with its cut and coloring working most of the year  for sizing id say its true to size i got my regular size s with no trouble with
i took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs i am  and  i could take them off without unbuttoning them they were hugh even the xs they looked like a halloween costume even at the discounted sale price awful and kind of made me laugh but i guess thats why they are still available at this sale price
i too was immediately drawn to this dress online and was this close to ordering a petite when i stopped my my local retailer and they had just gotten it in in regular only of course i tried it on in the xs regular and was thrilled to find it fit perfectly and was so flattering on my hourglass figure im  and  with a  dd chest no gaping or pulling the waist and shoulders were where they should be and i found the length with the hilo hem to be just above my knees in front i think
i loved this dress the moment i first saw it i have another dress from this brand that ive had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail however after trying this dress in both a size medium my typical size and a small ive given up it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a  there is room in the chest even in the size small so would look really good on a curvy girl im  ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees
three tops for the price of onei fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would not too short just right then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked this can be worn  waysback buttoned front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts recommend this highly for just about any body type
"this is a unique blouse it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago it is a gorgeous item it does have a boxy fit but it is not unflattering i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice"
"every now and then a piece like this one comes along at retailer and i quickly make the purchase without any regretwithout being stuffy or old this top is simply elegant the floral is very highend designer think italian made for a fraction of the cost made of  bamboo it is light without being sheer there is no need for a cami with this one the fabric has the body of a good linen but it doesnt wrinkle nearly as much it does require dry cleaning though if this matters to you"
"i cannot wait for summer  when i received this item i felt the same as the other reviewers it may be a little pricey for the material  then i tried it on  i love it just add some accessories and lets go"
i honestly just love the hanky panky brand i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie but the quality fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it this piece is no exception i dont normally purchase lingerie like this but saw this chemise and decided to try it just as the other pieces from this brand its comfortable and gorgeous so high quality and classy its a great cut the fabric is clearly lace but beautifully done and the feel is lov
"this dress is even more amazing in person the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance the kimono like sleeves have the same details  especially nice for toastingbe aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee a surprise but still quite lovely the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected"
the reviews are right about these fitting perfectly in the fitting room i knew right off i had to get them i have a flat rear end and these make my rear look great im  about  lbs and i chose the  i initially bought both the  and  to make sure they would not stretch out and the didnt i didnt want to be squeezed in with the  i think they are very well made and ill love wearing them for a long time
these jeans are the best fit perfectly so soft comfortable and look great on i am in love i put them on and did not want to take them off i am  and simply love the length for me plus in my opinion the high waist is a s dream so comfortable and really flatter my curves these are pricey which is my only real complaint but they are feeling worth it as i see myself wearing these a ton and the quality seems great so i am thinking they will last a long time dont hesitate to buy these
im curvy have very muscular thighs and am just under  i was not very optimistic when the sales associate told me i would love these jeans she was right theyre amazing they are incredibly flattering just the right length for me even tho cropped as i can wear them as fulllength or just add one or two rolls and its a crop the fabric is amazingly soft and they immediately felt like a favorite old pair of jeans the pockets are well placed so they do wonders for the bootie oh and
"this is my second jacket from this brand cartonnier and i am thoroughly pleased i love the quality and texture of the fabric of this coat i think the styling is super classic with a little bohemian edge i am   and  lbs and the size  fit me perfectly"
i purchased this jacket in my local store size  and runs really small  i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling looks like it is worn in an bad way returned the next day this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad
these jeans are worth every penny they fit me perfectly as soon as i put them on and i wore them the rest of the day they are true to size with very generous stretchif anything i would size down they feel durable but not like typical denim very soft i am  and about  or so and my normal  fit like a dream i did end up exchanging these because there was a small nick on the inside of the left thigh and i was afraid they might tear right open if the new pair comes without defe
this is such a comfy dress and recommend it to anyone pairs amazing with leather boots and hat
i received this dress in both colors oatmeal and blue for christmas and i love them they are super comfortable and great with leggings i can wear them just to lounge around the house or dress them up a bit for church i am  and  lbs and i got the small it fits true to size i would definitely recommend
i was on the fence about ordering my normal med but so glad i did it fits sooo well i do think its more suited for warmer days since the material is very thin its sort of a cropped length and looks great with sandals and heels i dont like showing off bra detail and will add some kind of closure detail to hide bra or wear a very lightweight top underneath this was a great buy especially with the sale

buy this dress you wont be disappointed its lovely and can be worn in the summer and easily transition to fall or even winter with opaque tights tall boots and a denim jacket the neckline is unique and stunning  demure yet sexy  something that can easily be worn during the  work day or into the evening i bought my regular size m and it hits just about my knees i dont think this dress runs small at all
wanted a cooler weather casual weekend errand dress and this is very confortable to wear with artistic leggings and tall boots pockets are always handy and it is easy to style with a contrast scarf or long necklace for added warmth can add a full slip or wear alone in spring with sandals received numerous compliments wearing the first time so purchased the navy one several weeks later anticipate wearing these dresses often and when the cotton finally wears down will use as a nightgown love
its a cute idea but its so low cut and the material is very thin i was hoping to wear it as a cool flowing summer top but ill have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it im only keeping it because it was such a good price also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten
just recently purchased and think its ok for the price would never pay full on this one  thats from an retailer shopper whos purchased plenty at full price design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color soso on construction  the bottom seams pucker slightly the pockets bunch up weirdly steaminglaundering dont help  the shoulders also hunch up oddly could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didnt help that issue either
i highly recommend this dress it is super flattering and i got so many compliments it fits like a glove and honestly made me look  lbs thinner very romantic and has great movement the length is perfect since the top is quite modest its nice that its on the shorter side  makes it a little flirty i wasnt sure of the pattern at first but it fit so perfectly that i overlooked it and bought it anyway by the end of the night i was in love with the pattern it really stood out and i can
very cute and flattering but id order at least one size down im usually a  and just during the time i tried on the  in the store i could tell theyd loosen up enough for a  ill review more once i have them had to order since they dont typically have  in store so cant comment on quality as of yet
love the jeans the color is listed as black for some reason but they are definitely blue like the picture and what i love most is ive always wanted somewhat distressed jeans but for me the ripped jeans look doesnt work these are perfectly distressed without being holey i also love the length im usually a  person because i love ankle length for boots tall and short these are listed i think a bit shorter than that i think but didnt feel cropped they are also made of some special

i do like the shape of this piece  it is eye catching due to the length and flattering  however if you are chesty this piece shows off more than i was comfy with and i dont think ive ever had that problem with retailer  in the body i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it  but up top the xs showed much too much cleavage      im still keeping it but i have to watch where i wear this
love this unbasic white top its very flattering on and i love that its a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion i am usually a size  in maeve topsdresses but i found a size  fit me a bit better in this particular top if youre in between sizes you may need to size down i definitely recommend this top
what a cute top i would say true to size it is a pullover so i went with a  for easy dressing the scalloped tank around the shoulders is unique and lays nicely i would say the top is a lined in cut not too swingy at all a great length to be left out or tucked in i can think of so many uses for this top i may grab another to keep on hand will be adorable with skirts or shorts
i love a crisp white poplin blouse and this top is perfect in that role i am between a small and medium in retailer tops because this top looked a little bell in the model photos i decided to order a  it was a bit snug across the chest for reference i am a  i returned it for the  and it fit perfect im not sure why this top was offered during the winter because it will likely hang in my closet until april highly recommend this blouse for summer
this velvet tshirt is perfect for the holidays i usually wear a size  top or a l but i ordered up and got a size xl it is very tight around my chest  and armpits and the vneck sometimes spreads apart a lot if i move my arms around a lot but other than that it looks great just runs small if you are a size  or larger i dont think that this will fit
a little more seethrough than you would think but has super cute smaller details also needs to be ironed a lot
beautiful skort true to size and very comfortable the actual shorts part of the skort is a nice modest length they have the appearance of a skirt with the utility and feel of a nice pair of shorts i cant wait to wear it again i am very pleased with my purchase
"great pair of work slacks with a flare wear these with boots give a very rich look super flattering cut and flat waisthighly recommend these for fall through winter"
i bought this in the mauve in my usual size small i think this sweater is intentionally big and slouchy so i would say it runs true to size it is very soft and the weave is airynot going to be warm enough for a below freezing day but i love the style the neckline is a bit fussy but i think you just have to wear it and let it fall the way it wants to the sleeves are long enough to cover your hands the sweater when pulled all the way down covers my butt and half my thighs and im  t

i was nervous to order the pants because i didnt think they looked great on the model in the picture they are by far my new favorite pants the fabric is so soft and stretchy yet hugs my curves doesnt stretch out during the day i was expecting the fabric to be thick or stiff but it is very lightweight yet professional for work the cut is perfecti wanted black culottes but im only  so a lot of them overwhelm me these are fitted at the top and gradually looser through the thighs a
i like this sweater i bought it in small and medium because it was  off and i didnt want my size to sell out im keeping the small im  and  lbs and hourglass the medium was way too much fabric its still roomy in the small but its lush looking and soft and will look pretty with jeans and high boots i ordered the one in the beige as well but i think the lavender color is prettier in person i think the beige may wash me out hope this helps

this dress is amazing and spans multiple uses i brought it to st john with me and used it as an after swim dress as well as a going out on the town dress it is flattering and a light but durable material the only thing that was even remotely challenging was that i needed to adjust my bra straps to be hidden overall i loved the dress and totally recommend it
taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it i ordered the medium normally wear a size  and is a little long but goes with my personal style i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home
"i am always on the hunt for a white shirt that is not too sheer so that i can wear it without a cami underneath on that count this top is a winnerregarding the fit it is a shorter top so i am not sure that it would be able to be tucked in a bottom for most people i am short waisted and i wouldnt be able to tuck it inin fact i think it is really meant to have an almost cropped fitfyi   broad shouldersback short waist  in a fitted shirt i take a  but i tried this"

gorgeous material great length for tall girls warm without being too heavy super soft i ordered the grey and white in small and have returned them for extrasmall i feel like they run a bit big though i seemed to have gone down a size at retailer in the past year not sure if its vanity sizing this is a classic sweater and a timeless staple  elegant and sophisticated the grey is that nice soft grey that doesnt wash a fair complected person out and is flattering with all complexions great
i know you cannot tell from the pictures but the fabric on this is incredible it is very light and extremely airy so that it flows when you walk i am a rather petite individual so it would require excessive tailoring for me to wear thisboth in length and in the top i think it was true to size with this exceptionand i wish they offered this in petite i would have tailored the length if it was only that but on the top i am not largechested there was a bunch of extra fabric that just lai
i walked into retailer today to buy  dishes for a registry  later i walked out with this dress and another ugh it is so beautiful in person it eversoslightly flares out and it definitely has that  feel i got it in white and plan on wearing it for my rehearsal dinner with tan platforms and a flower crown for reference  some hips and   and i got a medium would have gotten the small but it was slightly shorter
so im not sure if its just my body type or what but this did nothing for me the bottom which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium im a size  bottom and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose i just think this one is going to take the right body type it could look really beautiful on the right person just not me
"i think this will work well on very busty hourglass figuresor very petite frames but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular and my shoulders are broader than my hips wa  chest i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops and had i kept this i would have gone with the mthis shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep  above my elbow and made my arms look huge fyi the v neck is very de"
"i love this vest it is a great color and the inside is very soft i will definitely be able to dress it up or downif you are in between sizes i would definitely size up if you plan on wearing this with a little heavier turtleneckblouse underneathits amazing i feel so confident in it"
love love this sweater vest quality is wonderful and the fit is great highly recommend
i saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out it is quite a stunning piece i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have unfortunately there is entirely too much material in the bodice it was overwhelming on me for reference i am   and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress
i love maeve but this shirts quality was poor and it was not worth the price i would not recommend buying this online you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not and in my case this is being sent back
this is what a bathing suit should look and feel like no crawling up the cheeks  no spillage out the front i would say its true to size or a little on the large size im   and ordered a medium which was great for me maybe a small would have been ok but i couldnt be happier good job color is true to the pic quality seems nice and sturdy
fun outerwear for the fall the color is a bit more grey than the photo shows at least on my screen but i still think itll go with a lot
if you are shaped anything like me you will have to size up quite a bit on this one i tried it on in my normal size and probably needed to size up  or more sizes to get the proper fit the fabric has no give and feels a little cheap in my opinion for your reference i am a curvy athletic build with broad shoulders
i ordered xspetite but i think i better ordered xxs which was already sold out at the time i purchased i recommend one size smaller for this sweater this sweater is designed very wide for your shoulder which could be fallen down for people who usually prefer petite size but its really adorable

i ordered this top in rose the color is actually more of a cream with navy and yellow stripes but i could tell that from the photo when i was ordering the fit is true to size and the cut is very flattering excited to add this gem to my summer wardrobe
i ordered a ml in this vest and it fits perfectly thirst is cozy and stylish in fact i ordered the same vest in another color its versatile enough to wear with both skirts and jeans i also think its a timeless piece that will stay in style for years to come
i love the looks of this sweater on the model after receiving it it was still very pretty and stylish to look at my problem is that i am petite and the sweater seemed to run very large it wasnt very fitted i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted it made me look rather dowdy andor matronly unlike how it looks on the model i think that was because it was just too big i returned it

this was another unusual choice for a larger busted woman like myself but i couldnt say no to that sweet little back detail ill attack the waist with a cropped jacket for those looking to add volume or flowy fabric youve found your answer and then some
i wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant i am keeping though looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet
i tried this on and think it will look great with leggings and boots its very flattering without being too tight or too baggy some of retailers clothes are just too full and baggy for me and make me look large i am   lbs and ordered the medium which fits perfectly i ordered both the navy and yellow but the yellow has not arrive yet
after reading all the reviews i thought i would have to size up went into my local retailer and found this dress in a size  burnt orange color last one in stock it was still marked  so i think thats why it was still there i crossed my fingers and tried it on it fit perfect not to short or tight in the upper sleeve im  so maybe thats why the lenght was fine on me if you can find this in your local store try it on its really cute and comfortable i also have the front lace up j
i love the idea of this top but wish there wasnt so much fabric i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are

this vest is sooo cute  i bought the red really a dark burgundy and it is perfect for fall  i wanted to buy the other color but its sold out online  im  and the length is fine  im usually an xs  or  at retailer and the regular xss is the perfect size  i am on the busty side and doesnt make me feel too heavy like some vests
i love the look of this dress and the material  the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear i dont think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work it is a shame because i really liked the look of it
bought this shirt on sale it was super cute in the dressing room and for the first time i wore it washed it per the instructions wash delicate with cold water lay flat to dry and it shrunk so much i dont think im going to be able to wear it anymore it was oversized and loose when i bought it so it shrunk a lot there is also a small hole all of the sudden that i have no idea where it came from wasnt there when i put it in the washer very disappointed

i love the print on this its a super cute sweater but i didnt think it worked so much for a  yr old with a thickish middle the med was a bit snug but expect the large wouldve been too big   lbs a great statement piece for anyone with the figure to carry it
beautifully designed to flatter a womens figure i love the fit and feel of this classic but modern cardigan
when i first saw this in the store i loved the idea of this shirtdress with a twist i tried it on in my usual size  but could not get it over my  bust i wrote it off and moved on back in the store shopping for a party dress i saw this was now on sale although not right for the party i decided to try it in a bigger size a size  was not available but a size  was perfection if you are willing to size up you will be rewarded with a comfortable versatile dress that can be super casu
first the product arrived in a very small bag that made for many many wrinkles  almost impossible to determine what it might look like shame on retailer for sending their items in this manner secondly i dont know how individuals wear this with a bra the back is cut so low that my bra back band partially showed  not my idea of a good look third the front necessitated a cami and there is no way a cami can be worn due to how it is cut in the back returning now and i just received it
this is a modernized hippie sweater so beautiful blue is more for fall but i think the mustard color has more personality the large flowers add attitude pockets show comfort it is soft part silk fabric and lays nicely it is not thick enough for warmth but there is room for a tissue turtleneck regular s fits me well it should be relaxed look not fitted and i wear it as a dress with thick tights and boots i am    waist  hips and the hem falls right above my knees

so happy i purchased this  its a gorgeous piece and perfect for fall and winter the colors are soft and beautiful and i feel like this will pair well with a lot of shirts in my closet
i love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it i was shocked when i opened the package first the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono which brings me to the second disappointment it is not a kimono at all it has no kimono sleeve no sleeves at all in fact just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu
review title says almost all add to that that it is age appropriate unlike other kedia dresses for the very young just too cute for words i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart this however on an older woman looks ridiculous i would have liked it for those  months but even then it would cover quadruplets
"this is a really beautiful kimono soft and flattering as well as eye catchingcan be dressed up or downabsolutely recommend"
"beautiful shorts make you feel like a million dollars love love love themthe robe to match is also adorable"
this is one you just need to see in person stunning detailed embroidery everywhere gracefully oversized very bohemian light airy and dreamy this kimono was mine the second i saw it white on white is classicand this cream embroidery is beautiful the kimono is very oversized im normally a l or xl and this was plenty roomy its also quite long nearly came down to my knees and im around  if there is an option for petite id recommend it to shorter gals cant wait to pair this w
im short only  and this is beautiful and flowy its just below my knees and i think its perfect i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment and asking where i got it its unique and no one else carries one like this i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree i would rather pay for something that i love that has good design and quality instead of  or  for a so so product thats what i love about retailerpolog

i had such high hopes for this dress but unfortunately it misses the mark completely the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length for someone who is   the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolanders derelict campaign i think one must have a specific body type for this dress but regardless theyll have to keep their arms at their sides
i love this sweater and dont think the pics do it justice i ordered the light bluelavender color and couldnt be happier its great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots i received many compliments the one time ive worn it so far so glad to have snagged this on sale but i wouldnt have hesitated to pay full price
this may be lovely on some people but it didnt work on me at all i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight if i had gone up a size the top would have been huge the bib wasnt flattering on me and its also quite sheer too bad because the print is great maybe if youre athletic with slim hips you can manage it i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you back it went sadly
i would have bought this had it not been for the way the pockets are sewn in they are attached on the inside by a string if the string broke the pockets would dangle for the price you would think they would have sewn pockets in to the vest too bad
i tried this on at the store  the fuzzy trim around the bib is adorable and the overall texture with little puffs woven into the fabric has a nice quality feel to it the pattern of flamingos is fun and the fabric is soft it does run on the big and flowy side i thought it was very cute and comfy but ultimately did not buy it because the price is rather high and the petite length is sold out ill snap it up if it goes on sale
i saw this skirt online and loved the vibrant colors pattern and style it looks even prettier in person the material is light and soft the skirt is fully lined so you dont have to worry about it being seethrough also the skirt is a good length for me and wont drag on the floor happy with purchase recommend
i love how unique this vest is im still figuring out how to wear it in a feminine way as it lacks shape at the waist and the collar sometimes doesnt behave i think the sweater texture makes it more casual but i could belt it and wear with fancier shoes to glam it up it is a nice third piece to keep warm for fall or winterhopefully ill wear it more once i figure it out
fun fun fun love the polka dot but also the cut on this skirt is very flattering and retro it is perhaps a little yellower on the ivory side but neutral nonetheless te fit is very flattering  fit waist hops length  lbs  in waist i think i will have to keep this lovely item as i doubt it will make it to sale in my size
i saw this skirt online and had to have it as another reviewer mentioned the color is more of a yellowy ivory the skirt is very pretty but also has a very thickheavy satin polyester lining i dont feel like i could wear it during the summer because the thick poly lining wouldnt breathe that was the deciding factor and sadly ill have to return it
i just saw this in the store and had to pick it up i just love this green color and can imagine it going with a number of different types of topsdresses i personally think this looks best with a chambray button down shirt with this vest over it paired with slim fitting black pants and boots
i absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe unfortunately this particular product left a lot to be desired firstly the fit is slim not relaxed im  at  lbs and tried both the size  equivalent of a small and size  equivalent of a medium sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess they both zipped up easily but did not drape well finally the fabric was really not welcoming i prefer terry over fleece however this w
"the dress is nice but i was not excited about the color the only color is this blue also everyone has their favorite fit i think i like some other fit better my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fiti like to own dresses made of more natural materials"
this top is fantastic something about it has an ease of elegance and grace the overall structure and design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to wear i feel immediately put together and ready for anything the fabric has great texture and flows well without feeling like the wind will carry you away i purchased the offwhite  it is a bit seethrough but i dont mind wearing a cami underneath

these capri length pants are awesome  i do recommend sizing down though as the l was really big on me i am a  with most of my weight in my rear so normally never size down in pantsthe fabric is really nice and the print is versatile and allows wonderfully for pattern mixing  super comfortable
this is a stunning top but it did not work for me because it looked like a maternity top on me i think a person needs to be thin with a small bust to carry this off this would look good with many things from ripped denim to leather pants and is not necessarily just for holidays
"i really like this dress i wish they still had xxs p as the xs p is still a little big i guess ti is the style i love the eyelet design the high low is very flattering and the neckline too very comfortable i am not sure if i will keep it as i still think the xxs p would be more flattering but i like it enough to consider keeping the bigger sizenice with a jeans jacket and brown clogs lbs  dd  in waist"
this is a beautiful top it is something great to have in your wardrobe for the holiday season or a nice date night option i highly recommend it it runs true to size the price is actually reasonable as far as dressy retailer tops go as well
i wear these pants  days a week i work in advertising so they go perfectly with the polished trendy casual office attire that is required they are simply the most comfortable jeans i own and also make me look slimmer without looking too tight they are a unique type of material a soft but structured stretch weave so more polished than normal jeggings and smooth over bumps while still highlighting subtle curves the zippers at the bottom add an edgy polish but also provide a more
these pilcros jeans are so good love the fit the color and the feel i am a curvy girl and these are great they hit me just right now pilcro jeans used to strech out really bad but they seemed to have fixed the problemi wore these jeans at work for  hours and they did stretch some but not a dress size so i would buy the size you feel the most comfortable i think these are a no brainer

when i received the dress it was true to size on the bust and length i didnt purchase the petite but i wish i did since i am  i tried to wear my wedges but its still long i love the dress and would definitely recommend it
let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool it doesnt matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere it makes me itch so much that i just cant do it and i didnt not find this as itchy as others stated that being said you definitely need to size down i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric i still dont know what to think i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point

i know this is supposed to look oversized and i own a few oversized ponchos but this takes oversized to a whole new level  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric  i do not think sizing down would have made a difference  if you are looking for that it seemed like good qualify
seriously the best jeans i have bought in years  better than my favorite paige and ag stevies i sized down from a  to a  and they still arent super tight i think maybe some could even go down  sizes  i do still have a lot of room in the waist but i am pretty straight through the hips i am almost  with long legs and the tall is a great ankle length and fits me like the model wonderful stretch comfy great color and awesome ageing i dont normally like the ripped jean l
the fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me sadly it looked ridiculous on me i wouldnt recommend the top for busty girls it looked like a bell on me fyi it doesnt come with a camisole underneath
"stretch out fast  i order size  which is my usually size they fit prefect for about  and then stretched out feeling not right on my body maybe i should have gone down a  sizes even so i feel like the  and quality dont add up but they are very soft and comfortable i wouldnt buy them again"

i like the idea of the dress just not the fit in the bust im not particularly big  but it just didnt fit up there i wish the dress had built in support because you cant really wear a bra
i loved them on when i got them but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them and i had them on no more than  times it was not a fit issue or a seam issue they literally just frayed apart in two areas  while flattering and incredibly comfortable the fabric was not at all durablethey are not your typical  denim  they almost kind of a knit feel them
these jeans are awesome as most of the reviewers have already noted they are tastefully aged to look modern but not so ripped that i look sloppy they fit true to size with retailers recent sizing i used to wear a size  but in the last couple of years i have had to move down to a size  even though i am still the same size and weight anyway i bought these in a size  and they are perfect i have not worn them all day yet so i cannot comment on whether they stretch out after wea
its rare to find clothing made of quality fabrics and this is a fine soft wool blend the design is feminine without being overthetop and the fit is slightly loose as pictured on the model i would not recommend wearing it with a belt as pictured it makes it look too trendy and detracts from the shape of the cardigan which is beautiful on its own just skimming the body it is a perfect topper and can work for daytime or an evening out really lovely and one of the few things i decid
lovely but i am sensitive to some fabrics and i couldnt bear the feel of this lace wish it had worked so pretty in the picture
this top is both cute and flattering it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous i highly recommend
so to put this in some perspective when i tried on this dress for my husband after bringing it home he described it as possibly the best dress youve ever bought so thats definitely a winner i think what makes the dress great is that its not clingy but still had a good drape on the skinny models it looks large and flowy but on my curvier body it draped beautifully and is super flattering without being clingy or too tight im usually a size   and i sized down to a medium s
i have three pairs of these so i must like them the fabric is soft and comfy right from the start i think they might run just a bit large or small depending on the color you get i tried on a pair of pink ones in a  in the store i wanted the moss color so i had to order that and decided to order my usual size  they fit pretty much like the  in the pink but this fabric stretches so im happy with them theyre not too boyfriendy so not sloppy and you could dress them up wi
i am going on a trip to south africa in may and needed pants that were cute durable yet comfortable and not frumpy these are definitely the ones i was looking for the fit is great  not too tight and not too baggy i got them in three colors and all of them match what is on the site i definitely recommend these chinos as you will be able to wear them to lots of different places  dressed up or down
bought this in the green because i thought it was a bit different it is super flattering and the fabric is so soft and comfortable i have it in an xs and a s and havent yet decided which i am keeping as they both work im  and  going to wear it on an upcoming trip and i think i will get a lot of use out of it during the rest of the summer into the early fall i saw the black too and am tempted to buy that as well have i mentioned i love this dress
im an xl in retailer tops and purchased this in the size xl it fits very nicely not tight i usually have problems with peplum blouses hitting me oddly since i have a short waist but this fit beautifully i like the feel of the high quality fabric the color green works so well with my red hair i highly recommend this blouse

my favorite pants they do run slightly large so i sized down i have  colors and will continue to add more
i bought these pants in white and tan they are comfortable and fit greathowever they tend to stretch i just got them and they are already starting to become uncomfortably loose i still really like them but i recommend you buy a little tight so they become comfortable
these pants feel great fit is true to size the blue color is very unique definitely recommend

"i have these pants in a larger size but recently lost some weight and wanted a smaller sizethey are so comfortable and soft and go with everythingkeep in mind that they run a little large and do stretch a bit once you wear themjust wish they would be available in tall"
these are the most comfortable pants i have tried this season without sacrificing the style they look best rolled up for that casual chic look and can be dressed up or down these do run slightly large im  and   pounds and took the  petite size i bought the white color and will probably try another color or two before my size sells out love these and really recommend them
these feel well made and so soft but for me they were just too low and too baggyall i did was pull them up and feel uncomfortable i wanted them to work maybe in a smaller size they would feel better i ordered my normal  in the light pink they were very cute i think i just have a hard time with pants with a rise this low

i love the feel and quality of these pants however they ran super big they would not stay up around my waist unfortunately
i know weve gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable but sometimes its still that horrible texture unbreathable mess unfortunately thats what this top is made out of so it runs big its billowy and cute but i couldnt get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric
i tried this on in the store and loved it it runs large im   very short waisted and i got the xs i realized it had a sheer section on the side but the store paired it with a beautiful scarf that helped cover the sheerness i didnt feel i needed a cami while wearing the scarf plus the scarf will keep me warmer and let me wear the shirt a little longer in the fall
the waistband is reminiscent of yoga pants except looser i think these pants are a little large and widelegged i have a bigger butt and i like my pants on the looser side overall so maybe that is why they were super loose on me i think they are a great way to get away with wearing casual pants when you need to dress up i feel like they would look best on a taller person i need to get them hemmed

my only con would be these are longeven in petite they are long otherwise i have no complaints i love the comfortable fold over waist band ah i am planning to wear these on a long flightthey will help me look put together and keep my legs warm i always freeze on airplanes plus they will feel good i am  and must wear more than a flat sandali tried on with a wedge and it worked well not sure if i will hem or not might wait till after washing lovely ordered my typical pxs d
i love this top but i do need to wear a navy cami underneath  as the pic shows the lace in the mid section makes it completely sheer in place kinda odd placement in my opinion but if you dont mind the sheerness or a cami its a great top

love these pants im  and the length is perfect could even wear a little heel the fold over waist is so comfy they feel like pajamas but look very classy i bought the navy and silver more of a khaki color on sale for a great deal the washing instructions say line dry but i threw them in the dryer on low and they came out fine just need to remove and hang quickly for less wrinkles
first i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short because well it is that being said it is a perfect length for someone who is petite like me i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets which tend to make my short body look like a blob i love the length or shortness of this jacket aside from that it fits true to size is wonderfully warm and cozy and makes me feel fabulous when im wearing it it is my new favorite jacket 
i completely agree with the other reviewer this sweater is so much prettier in person ive been looking for years for a tasteful fur sweater and i think i finally found it the size large was true to size for me aside from the very long sleeves but i also have short arms the fur isnt overwhelming and i love the pockets i usually find sweaters with wool itchy but this one is not its  wool i do plan to wear a cami or tank underneath
the fold over is so comfy not the most flattering but really when you are wearing it you are going for comfort i think bought these on sale and trying to decide if they are worth it or not
these are some of the cutest jeans ive seen in a while i ordered my usual size  and they were too big im  and about  lbs i always were a  i reordered the  though and they fit perfectly the only disappointment was they make my butt look flat and emphasize my stomach which isnt the case in other jeans i think its due to the high waist they fit almost like a pair of pants oh well im keeping them i tucked in a striped sailor tee and they looked adorable
i love the dress enough to go on a diet i sized up but still have reservations about the integrity of the seams if i should sit at any point during its wear i hate skin tight clothing and wear a  in everything else  the  made me feel as if you could see my cervix i own other byron lars dresses that fit in a   something happened with this dress
the dress is a great buy especially since it was on sale it fits like his other dresses flattering as i dont have a big bust and have a bit of extra skin from pregnancies but with this dress i feel amazing get a ton of compliments when i wear it
this is a gorgeous dress it comes with a black silky belt but mine was too large which is probably why it is not shown on the model photos i think maybe it only works if youre on the larger size for the dress its very easy to get on and off due to the front zipper i was worried about bra straps showing on the low cut back but they actually show more at the broad shoulders im not sure if thats more apparent because i went up on the size to have room at the hips there is a cute kick p
this is an amazing dress beautiful fabric and color comfortable too its like wearing air sorta chameleon like because this print  literally goes with anything and looks unforgettable on its slimming too i got the large and it flows so nicely over my body the back is completely open it closes with a tie at the neck and the waist that drapes beautifully and looks great from the side view the fabric is a bit sheer so i ordered the white cotton slip by this designer which is slightly snu
"this cute dress was very nice on however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the sameother than that the colors and dress are beautiful"
im petite but even if i werent i think this runs very large isnt form flattering at all and overall looks dull it most definitely does not justify the price material is thin
i got this in the green color its a beautiful color soft to the touch i agree with other reviewers that it seems very delicate i dont mind drycleaning my sweaters so thats not the issue the problem is that a it runs huge  i got the small and it swims on me i tend to run between small and medium in tops  very unusual to have a small be so big on me and b the slits go even higher than they look on the model  they come up to the top of my waist even with highwaisted pants the sli
this is a beautiful quality knit i do wish that it was a tad bit longerim  with a long torso and found it to hit like the model shot since the sweater flares a little at the bottom i think it might be more flattering a little longer keeping this regardless because it will still get plenty of wear
this is a flattering comfortable soft sweater the instant you put it on a few instants after that however i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity im not optimistic about its longevity and wouldnt recommend it except for the extravagant singleuse buyer
"i bought this mostly to wear around the house so ill keep it because i got it on a pretty good salethat said this runs really large the sleeves are really loose and it doesnt really hang well over my hips which is a shame its very soft and cozy which is nice but i dont think ill leave the house in it often it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling bu"

this sweatertunic is lovely  soft just enough structure in the top to not look like a sack pretty color i ordered the raspberry which is definitely more of a burnt orangered to my eye i understand what another reviewer was referring to regarding quality the fabric just doesnt feel very substantial or strong i have a feeling this might not last too long and its a shame at this price point id love to order another color but will definitely wait for sale its office appropriate an
i purchased this in the creambeige color and love that it will go with everything i can add details with long necklace or scarfeven a belt but it also stands alone and looks great with leggings or skinny jeans i would also wear with a neutral skirt as shown on model the fabric is not too thin and with a bit of cashmere will also add some warmth it may shed some depending if you wear a nylon cami underneath i purchased the xs my usual size and fits great  love my purchase

loved the flared style of this cardigan i first choose the yellow and returned it for the navy the knit pointelle design is interesting and the cardi is so soft have used it many times already  always makes me feel great
"the sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on however the material is thin and slightly see throughalso after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear after the third time i wore it i discovered a large hole in the armpit most likely due to the excessive washing i would not recommend this sweater"
i agree with the first reviewer exactly beautiful fabric and idea of dress looks stunning on model but huge and shapeless in person like a tent not at all what i expected when ordering a  petite sadly has to be returned
i ordered this sweater in green and it was a lovely soft color the style of the sweater was nice  really deep side splits made it feel trendy the sweater is a great length nice fabric and the side splits are appealing however it was just so so big that i couldnt pull it off  i just swam in it i am  and  lbs fairly wiryeven the xs didnt work for me perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman i even considered having it tailored since ive had a hard time find
"i thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the caseit is a pretty heavy nice thick cotton and beautiful made it does run large i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my  frame but  it is not white it is beige and it is not light weight i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back even though it was a great buy on sale"
this is an extremely flattering dress i couldnt resist buying it even though i didnt come into the store looking for a dressier dress which i feel this is once i tried it on i had to purchase it its one of those things that i know i wont regret because at some point an occasion will show up that ill wear it to its soft comfy and flowing and accentuates the bodys curves without being too tight or clingy its a classic
i really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly cant now i was attracted to the softness simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it wrinkles pills and loses shape quickly if you still want to get it consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size the styling is excellentvery versatile but the yarn is too delicate and fussy
i consider this to be a flattering dress that is a good wardrobe staple since it can be dressed up or down and worn with a variety items ie cropped denim jacket oversized knit cardi leather moto the twisty knot in the front is very cute and slimming and doesnt add bulk to my squishy squarish waist this dress is tts to a bit large the colors and material make this appropriate for autumn through spring my only upset with this dress is the raw edges which cheapens the quality and makes m
i just received this shirt in the mail and im in love it isnt your average tshirt in that it has character and class i cant wait to wear it another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasnt as dramatic as the picture im not seeing it i think the blue stands out very well i know i should say hurry and get yours before theyre gone but in truth id rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt 
this dress is so well made but its a lot of dress i think i would have liked it if it were shorter it felt a little too  housewife to me and i was hoping for a flowing material it wasnt worth the price to me so i sent it back
after reading all the reviews and sizing down one size i got my top size m i usually wear ml depending on the style im  ft tall  lb i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists no wonder there is such a low leap in price it is a good quality though and very nice pale peach color no would not recommend unless you wear 
this robe is one of the best purchases i have made in the past year i would also add that it is much cuter in person than pictured on the model usually things look better on the models but not this one i have a tough time finding robes and sleepwear in petite sizes thank you retailer this robe is sooooo soft and cuddly without being too heavy the teal color is so pretty and the hemstitch detail is nice i hate taking this off in the morning to get dressed
i knew once i saw this online that i would love it because of that i almost feel like my review is biased i have been searching for a jacket like this for awhile i own the holding horses version from a few years back but that one is just not fitted enough in the waist for me even though it has a drawstring waist this one too has an interior drawstring waist and it is more fitted in the waist giving the feminine appearance i desire but its not too tight i am small up top  but larger
"not that i dont recommend only dont recommend if you have muscular thighs so i tried on the small in plaid pattern or checkered and not flattering on me at all snug on the though and loose by the knee and below also that pattern made my legs look weird no kidding kind of crooked they are super comfortable and the small fit so perhaps they run smalli would get petite if you are usually a petite the regular size bunched on the bottom too longi am usually a  or  or"

i got these in the brown and the red in my usual xspetite and love both the length is perfect for my  height and theyre not skin tight but fit like a glove i have a  waist and  hips the elastic inside the waistband can get flipped fairly easily if im not careful but its easy to flip it back i think thats the only thing that might stop me from attempting to wash them in the machine against the instructions which say to hand wash only i wish they had been made machine washa
i picked these off of the rack at retailer mainly because i loved the navy black and brown combo of the squares i tried on the medium because they looked on the small side even though i usually wear a size  or small in pants good thing too these fit really wellso they do run small albeit a bit long in the regular medium on my  frame i could have used a petite for length if they had been there but they didnt thats ok i dont mind rolling them up it makes a statement i like ye
this skirt is gorgeous im glad i saw it instore as the picture online does not do it justice the colors are really rich and the pattern has a sentimental vintage feeling it also has pockets and a great glamorous swing to it this skirt is great for work with a blouse and heels and also looks awesome with a tshirt tucked in and sandals the fabric has a really nice four season weight i think it will also look great with high boots and a turtleneck in the autumn i get so many compliments
i thought this top had shimmery dots that is what it looks like in the picture but when it arrived it looks much plainer inperson and i could not believe it was this top the dots are polka dots the embroidery at the vneck doesnt stand out much in the photo but it does inperson the top runs true to size but the fit didnt feel as perfect for me i am sending it back i needed a more shimmery top
"this looked beautiful online but the skirt isnt  silk  the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels with most of them containing some level of polyester parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap overall very disappointing  this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be onlinea definite return i wouldnt even recommend this at first or second cut"
this sweater is so cute and classic and ive gotten so many compliments its so gorgeous the wool is sooo warm  recommend
perfect lace tank i am six feet tall and this top hits me about where it does on the model i ordered xl and feel it is a generous tts  it is very figure flattering and not too tight across the bust it has a thin lining so no camisole is needed so beautiful

this shirt is really quite cute it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion its also forgiving and quite flattering my only concern is that it is a bit see through in certain lighting but it is very subtle i definitely would recommend
i love this tee while it is true to size i feel it is meant to have a loose fit that being said it is a very flattering cut and has a great drape super comfy flattering and classic
i love this sweater as others have mentioned its not the softest acrylic in the world but i can overlook that for the simple fact that its adorable i like the cropped fit pairs perfectly with high waisted jeansskirts the embroidery has a sort of handmade feel to it without looking cheap the slit up only one side makes it unique in my opinion i did expect it to be a bit heavier but its a great layering piece and ideal for transitioning into colder weather i may be biased because of

i love the feel and quality of this sweatshirt however because of the embroiderylace detail on the shoulders it makes it a little stiff so the shoulders look slightly boxy
gorgeous piece although much longer than it appears to be in the photo the price however is a bit steep im not sure that im going to keep it because i just dont think it looks as expensive as it is
another maeve maxi to add to my crowded closet i adore the print it reminds me of morocco i went with my usual m based on reviews about the waistband i will have to disagree as i should have chosen s instead im not going to return it but i think this will really stretch out because of the knit and weight of the jersey

this dress is a beauty i am  and plan to wear this as a tunic over leggings or straight leg pants the embroidery is really pretty even though it does run a bit big i would have liked a size  or less but it was completely sold out except for a size  it is so nice with gorgeous high quality denim that i will make the best of it  may need to get some tailoring but in my mind this dress is so worth it
love this dress so much i bought the cranberry color first and i loved it so much that i also bought it in black i think it runs fairly true to size i am  and about  and the xs petite fit perfectly i tried the xs and it was pretty large on my frame i love the fabric and flow of this dress and i love the pockets
the material and color of the dress were great but the fit was rather blah i dont think it was right for my shape i am disappointed though i liked design of it
i was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering whatwasithinking when you try it on later when i bought this once i tried this on at home i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing  theres so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back i wanted to love t
this is absolutely gorgeous cardigan the pictures dont do it justice its comfortable and soft and very trendy at the same time i bought it in teal and in medium i am  and usually wear  even though i think it runs tts but for more fitted look medium fits better  i am blond and this color looks great i also loved it when unzipped the upper part it looked even better it is perfect with leggings in grey blue green and black also beautiful with aqua flora leggings and with re
as a busty but smallwaisted girl i normally would not wear a loose shift like this however it turned out to be perfect for hiding my earlymid pregnancy belly the dress is extremely comfortable and it will also come in handy in the postpartum months in fact it looks so cute that i might just add it to my regular wardrobe after all
this top has a nice quality feel to it with natural fibers and i love the pom poms however it does have a roomy fit so you might want to size down as a petite person i have a tendency to get lost in very billowy styles overall comfortable and cute and a nice rich blue color
so soft warm and comfy the colors are absolutely beautiful and represented accurately in the photo i went with a small based on other reviews and while it fits it is slightly big i probably could have sized down for a more tailored look but i like the extra room and think it still drapes well without looking bulky for reference im   lbs  and mostly wear an  in tops it does shed which is not a big deal to me but might be a deal breaker for others so i thought i woul
first i think this dress runs a bit large  i am  and about  athletic build i tried on a l m s and ended up keeping the small it is also a bit longer than id like hits me in the midknee in the back hem and barely above my knee on the front hem not midthigh like on the tall model i probably would have preferred a petite size but they were sold out anyhow i decided to keep this dress because it is super comfortable but still stylish enough to wear to work the slightly fitted a
"i loved the idea of the placement print around the neckline and shoulders and even the nape the print transforms an otherwise basic tshirt into an eye catching top it lacked in the length department and there was extra fabric under the sleeves that wasnt flattering just above the girlsthis is made by retailer brand postmark i own several tops by this brand and found that their printed fabric tends to fade out from wash  as is usual for postmark the brand was not stated on the produ"
this dress drapes beautifully and fits tts i purchased the green colour in a petite small for reference i am  and  lbs rather than feeling clingy this dress skims the body and hides trouble spots while highlighting everything i like about myself for that reason i went ahead and paid full price with no regrets looks fantastic with black tights and black ankle boots or bare legs with cowboy booties highly recommend
very cute and flattering very fitting in legs and thighs and i have fairly slim legs i am a size  and  was very snug i recommend trying these on in store or trying several sizes to see best fit
i am a petite size  and      i love the fabric and style of the dress but found it to be too much dress for me  the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin taller person
i saw these paired with the denim swing tank in the store and was inspired by the nautical look the fit was a little snug i am between a  in pants and definitely had to go with the  and even that was a little tight for reference i am  and  lbs curvy on bottom the sales lady said they will stretch and there is some give to them but i dont anticipate a lot of stretch they are slim fitting all the way down and are flattering to the rear i think they look better in person than on
i ordered this dress in the red stripe and i love it it is casual and easy to wear with flat sandals or booties the dress is not really sheer like you might think from the picture and it included a nice knit under slip in a pale peachy pink shade that fits true to size as well the dress has more of a soft woven cotton feel to it the slip is not really necessary but nice that it is included i looked at the blue color but it looks more like a tunic in the pictures i think that the looks are

"this dress has great details and fit well on my hourglass shape it just felt too covered up at the armsshoulders though if the sleeves had been shorter or it had been sleeveless i think it would have felt a little more modern the waistband on the one i tried on was also twisted so you might want to check that before you buy fit is tts a little on the short side"
i was hesitant to order this top since i didnt know how well the design would be made on the front i liked it but sometimes items are different when you get them this shirt was as pictured the design is well made and there are no stray strings and i think its probably one of the nicer designs available the top iis a dressier fabric but can be worn with jeans as well as dress pants also some shirts with this cut are skimpy in the front and leave more skin exposed than what you see here t
the fabric is breathtaking both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone as usual eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size size regular  i am    waist  hips fit well the hem is below my knees appropriate for work but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress the top part looks strange does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me thus one star off
when i tried this top on i started laughing the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton which instead of falling by the hips juts out like wings its also huge cute idea wrong material and placement
whoa these are very highwaisted but i think i like it this is a very  style with the high waist and wide legs the brown motif is kinda funky i am a  lover though so i was pleasantly surprised the tall length is more than adequately long for my  frame i may need to take them up a little bit in fact
cute easy to wear perfect little top will go with so many things the scalloped shoulders add such a nice touch im a solid  with a pretty large chest i think i need to go up not sure about to order a  to see if there is a big difference so if you have a larger chest you may want to order two sizes

"just a little scallop makes this top special if your on the edge of a  i suggest sizing up fabric crispwell made and worth full price"
i love love love this skirt very flattering i am  with a  waist and ordered a size  based on previous reviews yes it is snug through the hips i think it will stretch a bit with wear however i imagine curvy ladies may want to size up sadly i was not blessed with much in the way of curves the material is thick the skirt is lined the print is beautiful this is one skirt i was happy to pay full price for rather than risk missing it
i loved this skirt but it was slightly too small i did not realize it pockets which is always a drawback for me in dressesskirts i have an hour glass frame and the extra fabric from pockets is too poofy in my opinion beautiful color and high quality fabric
i bought this dress as a poolbeach coverup but it is so cute i think i will also wear it other times as well it is very comfortable and lightweight perfect for the hot weather
this dress looks simple but man is it unexpectedly sexy and oh so comfortable the deep v neckline and side slits elevate this from a simple tshirt dress to something else add just the right accessories and this dress transforms i have the xs and its just roomy enough without being clingy and did i say how comfortable it is the fabric is perfectly lightweight without being flimsy and color is a cool saturated denim color i receive compliments every time i wear it love love love
this is a beautiful blouse and well made i read the previous reviews and im usually between sizes  and  so i sizedup and ordered size  and it fits well i purchased the pink and its soo pretty im very satisfied with my purchase and i highly recommend this blouse
"tried the size small regular me   straightish shape broader shouldersits described as slim fit but i found the small to be a loose fit on me i would almost consider trying the xs if i wanted something less baggybut i think the style is meant to be very laidback i tried to picture the extra material i hadthe color is a lovely denim blue and the length on me was just as the website describes deep v neck but not to the point where i feel id need a cami those of"

this is definitely true to size i tried both the small and medium on in the store and the small was too tight this is meant to be a little looser like a tshirt the medium was spot on not too tight and not too baggy i think its a fun go to piece that can be worn with a jean jacket and sandels or booties it looks like denim too which i wasnt expecting way better in person
i received this skirt today and am absolutely thrilled as a short and curvy lady i feel most comfortable in fuller skirts but not too poofy and this one lies perfectly does not make my hips look wide the colors are soft and very feminine which also suits my style it may seem like a springtime skirt but i will start wearing it with tights and a sweater right away
i read the earlier reviews on this and though i agree that the photo here does not show how wide and swingy the top is i love it it is so adorable and comfortable i bought the petite s and i am   lbs it fit true to size in the shoulders the petite hits just a few inches below my waist so you might want to keep that in mind if you do not want it to be this short the sweater part is soft not itchy and the poplin sleeves and ruffle are crisp but soft as well because this is very
love this top got it in white for a recent trip to paris  felt chic and cool during a bit of a spring heat wave in the city of lights it runs somewhat small  im   lbs broad shoulders and got the  my usual  fit but was a little snug i would recommend going up in size in this style the  looked better because it is supposed to be a boxy swingy top
the color of this dress is just so beautiful  somehow both rich and airy i believe this is meant to be a more relaxed fit but that isnt quite my style so to achieve more of a silhouette i was lucky enough to stumble upon an xxsp petite in store i normally would never even try something on in this size but it looked pretty generous so i decided to give it a try so glad that i did it gave more figure and i liked the length a bit shorter with this dress i think you can achieve the lo
i created a summer capsule wardrobe for travel and this tshirt dress fits in with my collection perfectly it is well made super soft and comfortable launders well and does not require ironing it is substantial enough to provide coverage across the posterior and the cap sleeves and length are fabulous for visiting sacred places and dining out or as a beach coverup i love that you can simply throws this on and go or dress it up with a belt add a scarf or kimono or a jacket and voila
great coastal sweater color in my opinion is a perfect rendition of coral the sleeves hit just right for me to wear long or bunch them up i can see this sweater paired with shorts or skinny jeans
while the white version is a tad more twee this one in black is edgier more sophisticated tts for my  chested broad shouldered self in a  all the unique details add up to an outstanding versatile piece how it blouses out in back opaque enough to wear without a cami the scallopsi may keep both colors
i have shirts and dresses from this brand and they are great i was happy to finally see a pair of pants these are just as soft and well made as the other items i would recommend you try them on there is only a slight variation from one size to the next so it will depend on what look you are going for they are cropped at the calf but can be pulled up for a more dressier look i cannot say enough about the material it is so soft and comfortable they do wonders for your behind i think

"i purchased this in white my normal size being a  a size  fit better on me i love the crisp white top with jeans and sandals so much that i just ordered the same top in the raspberry color would definitely recommend"
nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle they fall at a strange place on the calf  a better cropped summer pant perhaps
i liked the idea of this tshirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple however i feel that it was overpriced for the quality its a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale

hesitated to try it on because it was tshirt dress and my experience has been that fabric is unforgiving for dimples or imperfections   i was wrong with this one its great  color is nice fabric looks textured bc of the dye the neck line is perfect i like a lower v and the length is great bc of the side slits i tried it on with the front panel knotted at the bottom how it was on the hanger and i love it  had to get can dress up or down but id say this has mostly a casual feel
the blue is a beautiful color rather unique and it is really soft being cashmere although for the price i do feel it should of been a bit more special i also feel its loose lower half feels a bit maternity all that being said i do like the overall sweater and am keeping it as the color and feel win

love this top tried it on in storeso glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium the color is a beautiful camel and the material is softvery grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool lol therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wearthe price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i dont mind spending the extra 
i love this top the neckline is so unusual and so flattering i am normally either a small or xs but this fit great in the xs i was also able to wear a regular bra which is always nice since i am large chested great tophighly recommend
"the styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin kind of scratchy  hasalmost no give to it  it is very uncomfortable on  is very restricting as far asmovement is concerned   cannot recommend  back it goes"
"this sweater is substantial wellmade fabric is thick and comfortable the length is on the shorter side not cropped but shorter perhaps if they had petite ti would be cropped the sleeves are perfect length too on me it looks shorter on the model they hit at mys wrists i do usually need petite length it seems a simple top but it is quite beautiful in person i strongly recommend it even for the pricexs and i am  lbs  chest  in waist"
i initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders im regularly a size   and  lbs and both size  and  did not work for me
this vest is so functional i think it is much prettier in person than in this photo it has a much softer look to it and is less orange more tan ive worn it with a lot of different things over a sweater dress at work with soft pants and a longsleeve tshirt or skinny jeanspants and a simple top wish it came in other colors gray navy or green would all be amazingone of my favorite pieces this season for sure i do think it runs a little bit large but i think the next size smaller

i just got this in the green and id say the color is deeperdarker than shown more of a turquoisegreen or muted teal color its the densest thickest cashmere its  cashmere ive felt in a while and its so soft but it just doesnt look good on me im  and about  lbs and usually wear xspetite i got this in the xs regular hoping it would be long enough for leggings and i dont think it is in the back plus its just too bell shaped and im slightly pearshaped already it
i love the material of this shirt and i love the design however there is just too much fabric it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all for someone who is petite this just wasnt flattering i love the design idea though
beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders arms and chest such a shame since i really love the shirt
this is a beautiful top but the fit is odd its roomy and flowy in the bust and waist but the arms are disproportionately tight i wear a size  in all hd in paris tops but this one didnt fit anything like the others i wouldnt even know what size to recommend because its almost too big in the body while being too tight in the arms the lace and mock neck is beautiful though so im hoping to find someway to wear it comfortably otherwise it will be going back
i have several lilka pj bottoms and im glad to add these ones with the adorable bird print to my collection tts soft flannel striking colors only wish they had pockets
this dress is as stunning in person as it is in these pictures im petite and so its longer on me than it is on the model i got a  and the waist was perfect i thought it might look matronly as it was longer but it looks classic i feel like i could dress it down just a bit with flats and a cardi or wear it to an event with heals and a wrap its so comfortable and forgiving in the waist and belly area which is icing on the cake i had absolutely no reason to buy it but once i tried it
i have no idea why this has bad reviews how is there any left this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green i love that it comes with a cami  very flattering and not too wide or boxy the lace detail is amazing i bought my usual size and it fits perfect love this top
this dress fits really cute i actually think its cuter in person than on the site really flattering the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model so its appropriate for work and networking functions im   i got the  and its great
yes it runs very large i usually wear a m and ordered the xss i like the oversize fit and i think this poncho is unique chic and modern definitely worth the price especially on sale very nice quality fabric
"this is the kind of weather i want to wrap myself up with a cozy and soft blanket but i cant really walking around with a giant bulky blanket this cardigan is as good as i can get its so soft comfy and well made nowadays most of the knitwear are made of dominantly polyester this one is mostly natural material with has a much better feel than the man made kindi like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight warm enough for the breeze but not too thick love it"
this dress has a beautiful shape it was a onesie in a store only one they had and im glad i tried it on usually im a  or  this is an  and its a perfect fit definitely size up at least one dress size the knit shoulders are beautiful and the belt is slimming i love the writing on it its a classic dress and it makes me feel beautiful and unique
i tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag i think its unique and interesting i just dont think its worth the  the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost i would consider it on sale retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price  all things considered i dont think its a smart purchase

i am very glad i purchased these shorts on sale bought the coral color in a large   with a generous underside and long legs i usually wear a m or a l in yoga pants the l here fits really nicelynot too tight and enough length in the inseam so that i dont feel silly practicing outdoors in the park the rise is also perfect
oh just wow this jacket is simply wonderful ordered my regular size large and its a bit oversized due to the swing cut and absolutely adorable on love everything about it except the length which is very cropped its lightweight yet warm and very cuddly the snap closure is wonderful then theres the leather trim which just takes it up a notch plenty of room for a sweater and its lined although its so cropped i think the length will be attractive worn over anything thats longer
i love this top because it can be worn on or off the shoulders and looks equally as cute either way i bought the red color and it is super cheerful and perfect for summer looks great with faded jeans i love the poplin fabric although the stitching quality is shabby and i expect this wont hold up long enough to wear again next summer for the price i feel like it should be crafted a little bit better i am narrow shoulderd and bra size  b or c and while a medium might have fit me better o
the pictures do not do this dress justice this dress is gorgeous the color is beautiful and it is so flattering on even better this dress is machine washable simply hang it up to dry and it looks like it is fresh from the cleaners i love this dress so much i dont even mind that i purchased it at full price and now it is on sale buy this dress for a special occasion  it is so special
runs small arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest would not recommend
great top  high quality  could use some stretch   recommend it
this is a great top except i wish it was a bit longer or i wish it came with a short tank it hits right at my pants which wouldnt be terrible although not ideal except my tank that i need to wear under it is long and so i either need to tuck it in or it will hang past the shirt neither is what i was hoping for still like it so debating whether to take it back i think at full price i will return and consider it again it it makes it to sale
this dress is lovely and easy to wear if you are short and you buy regular size not petite i am  and i bought the regular medium so the length of the front falls just above my knees i can wear it to work without leggings the other thing i love is it has pockets and it fits generously  i weigh  lbs and will usually fit in a medium if i dont breathe and a large if i use a belt but in this size medium regular  i can breathe and i need a belt ergo  i dont feel like i need to
no complaints about this top i like that its very soft and the length is good as a tunic would recommend
"this is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on my problem is a short torso but then again this may be made for short torso loving people i felt like i was all legs in it i never asked anyone elses opinion though so not sure if its just me and my complexif you dont have a short torsothen you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waistoverall i am not sure who this was designed for but"
i fell in love with this top online i am obsessed with the little flounce detail on the sleeve and the slight aline shape of the body i was able to try it on in store and was glad i did because i ended up sizing up to a small from my usually xsmall i still put true to size because i think the forgiving cut allows the top to work in multiple sizes i even tried on a medium and it still looked like it fit the arms are a bit tight as the other reviewer mentioned so keep in mind when choosi

really cute top love the ruffle detailing and the pattern quality could be slightly better since i slightly expected the material to be softer either way im happy with the top got my usual xs and it fit perfectly its meant to be a looser top so i dont mind that it runs a little bigger
i bought this dress with my birthday coupon i love the design of the fabric and i think the length is great its a lightweight dress which makes it a nice for more seasons sandals in the summer light sweater in the springfall and tights slip and heavy sweater in the winter the underarms wrinkled a lot the first time i wore it which makes sense because i was wearing a sweater the rest of the dress did not wrinkle at all very satisfied
this dress is fun and flattering love the pieced denim look and the aline style unlike other reviewers i found this dress to be true to size for my pearshaped figure the length is long enough to wear anywhere and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures
"i ordered this on a whim as i though hey i dont have off the shoulder tops lets try ti looks cutei ordered the nude after debating but glad i did it is a bit warmer in color and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it maybe i am seeing things it is soft not sure there is wool i am not that sensitive to wool felt soft to mesize i ordered the xxs as i think lately retailer has been making things baggier and on a shorter pe"
"i love this dress because it is different and unique i agree with others that the torso runs tight i got lucky and it still fits snuggly i think thats the look the upper part should get with the bottom more aline and flowy its super cute though the material is truly jeans material therefore quite heavy and think maybe not a dress for summer more spring or fall with a little sweater"

the lace on this is gorgeous its feminine and elegant and fancy definitely know if peplum style tops work for you before purchasing if you have a large waist it will just make you look bigger but the top portion is nice and fitted so i think its very flattering im   and got the small fits great
love this dress very comfortable and stylish wanted my size but they only had a size larger available still bought it but feel good in it glad i purchased it
after reading all the reviews i ordered up a size the problem isnt that it runs small its that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size or if you want to think of it differently  the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size the  top with the  bottom would be perfect unfortunately  you get a size  fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws spare tire or a size  that is atrociously long in the torso
this top is comfort wear or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer that said it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable
i was very excited to try out this dress ive been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now and im not digging this one the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat its cheap looking to me ive seen nice velvet and this is very shiny thin and slightly sheer the dress cut itself is what i was expecting a loose baby doll type dress the length hit above my knees the overall effect made me feel very gypsyishmy husband gave a firm no when he saw me walk out of
i cant believe the reviews this dress has gotten i ordered it and was so excited to get it when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone while i love the color the quality just isnt there and its not worth the money even with the  discount i used the fabric is not thick in fact it is quite sheer for velvet i honestly wouldnt feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this second is the fit im   xs on top  on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w
i love this dressi saw it on the way out of the store and was struck by the gorgeous color and rich velvet fabric and had to touch it and then try it on i did not find it to be tight in the shoulders at all nor do i think it looks cheapon the contrary the shape is indeed boxy but it is still very flattering and comfortable i wore it to a christmas brunch and got a ton of compliments the only drawback for me is that it has to be dry cleaned for reference i am   and usually wear
"i love this shirt red  navy is one of my fave color combos and the vintage feel is fantastic the fabric is a little thicker and more sweaterlike than i was expecting but its a good thing the top isnt heavy but the knit gives it more texture  interestthis is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy lookcovered but formfitting and flattering"
got this dress in the mail today and will have to say that it is not the most figure flattering dress i own my  athletic frame looks pretty boxy in this that being said the fabric is a soft shiny bluegreen the garment swings nicely and has a slightly lower hem in the back on me anyway and i think thats fun who needs close fitting clothes during the holidays  im keeping it i plan to wear it with hot pink tights and boots
i was not a fan of these leggings these were very unflattering i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out i just didnt feel like they would hold up for even one season
i am very pleased with the quality and fit of this dressthe reader outfits next to the listing were darling i do not care for the model shot i think the dress is true to size and well constructed
these leggings are super comfy i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down and the leggings fit wonderfully lately ive been having a problem with leggings falling down at the waist and these stay up nicely so i was very pleased the leggings have a slight itch because of the sweater feel but they are very warm and i enjoy wearing them
"looking for a stylish rain resistant coat to wear to ireland this fall and looks like this could fit the bill the  length is perfect the faux fur lined collar and opening edges is a lovely touch fur ends about  inches in so not fully lined but great for weather in   with a sweater added  ample room for that i love the look wish the pockets were just a bit bigger i can barely fit my hand in but overall i think its a keeperi ordered ml and am usually a medium or la"
this skirt is gianormous i usually take an xl or l so i ordered both the waistband on the xl was so huge i didnt even try it on i feared it would not stay up so i tried the large and it was big as well i think i would have needed a medium but as it is it is not the cute aline that appears in the picture i wonder how they even got it to look like that  it is huge hipy and bunchy yuck
"i ordered this online and when i opened the package i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top it is much nicer than a basic tshirtwhen i tried this on the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage also the overall length is listed as  long but i think that is the back of the shirt the front of the shirt is very short on me im  hitting well above my hip bonesif only this was much m"
this tunic is a great length  im  and it hits me midlower thigh its so soft and flowy which i love i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that im almost  months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby arm holes are big but a cami can fix that i got both colors available the ivory and light red
this top is not quite what i expected but it is good quality and very comfortable looking at the tall willowy model in the pictures i thought the top would be about tunic length and hang straight down in reality the design adds volume to your frame by cutting out in a kind of aline from shoulder to midthigh in fact the shirt is so long and has so much flare that i think if i had ordered the regular size rather than a petite it would actually make a cute dress for reference im  a
beautiful dress the details are lovely it feels a little bit like a nightgown i always wear a slip bust does run a little small so i unbutton the first few buttons armholes feel a little small also
i tried this on a whim during the sale with no real intentions of buying but the moment i put this on i feel in love the denim is soooooooo soft it is heaven seriously one of the most comfortable pieces i have ever tried on the fit is very flattering and it can be worn multi seasons so it went home that night i put it on and walked doen the stairs and my two year old daughter said mommy is so pretty  score this dress is so simple and can be styled so many ways plus it seems very
im  and wear a size  this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it found the bust to be a tad tight  it is light with good movement i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it im looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season
"these are so cute and the colors are great however they stretch out about  sizes they fit me perfectly and i sized down and they stretched out about a size  to  sizes too big im bummed out because they are perfect in every other way didnt think they would stretch out as much as they did and they look awful oncetheyve stretched out wish i didnt take the tags off or i would have returned them size down atleast one size i could have sized down two sizes hoping they shrink lik"
i love this skirt the material is soft and beautiful i love wearing it with black tights and boots the skirt is quite a bit longer than how it appears on the model however unless the model is  ft tall i am  and if i place the skirt under my ribs it reaches right above my knee it works though and doesnt look bad i would still recommend you buy this
this is definitely my go to top for work weekends or night out with the husband ive worn it with skinny jeans black tights and skirts it goes with just about anything easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo
"i love the colors on this dress very nice on a pale skin i ahd this in my wish list for so long and it finally went on sale i ordered it and was very pleased only drawback is the collar was a little irritating but i am ok with it it fits like a glove o i didnt think it would as there are no petites but that worked for me the lace pattern is classy and the hem is totally fun great purchase maybe petite would not have bothered my neck lbs  dd  in waist"
the suit is lovely but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg i was told that it runs small and to size up to a  i did but i do not think the smaller one would have done better the bust is fake and it turns out when untied worst of all it emphasizes the tummy all in all not a good look for me i am not heavy but i do need tummy support normally i wear an  and in garnet hill a  sorry but it went back i really wanted to like it
love this shirt i have it in black  i have a larger chest but i dont feel like the seams hit me wrong  this is super cute and swingy  i however think the price is way too high for a think cotton tee

this chambray is super soft it has such a great feel and texture i love the detail and design on the front it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways im not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirtstops but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my which isnt large so excited to get a lot of use out of this

i bought this tunic over christmastime at full price i absolutely adore it in my opinion it isnt too thick or too thin i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly there are side slits so its perfect with skinny jeans or leggings its flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric also with the grey color there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction so this adds some additional visual appeal i havent had any problems with snagging

i am   generally size medium shirt size  or  pants and bought a size  i have had two csections so my stomach has some problem areas which can be easily highlighted in a swimsuit not this one i felt good it hid my problem spots showed off curves and stays in place i cant speak to the durability of it yet however it makes me feel great and that is tough when i am in a bathing suit that in itself makes it worth the price try it
i bought these pants in the wine color and i love them i found them to be true to size i always wear a  in pilcro and these were no exception i am finding the cropped flare silhouette to be so versatile they are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am  but i think i prefer this these pants can easily be dressed up or down  have worn with a dressy top and heels as well as a denim shirt and ballet flats super cute
i really like this blouse its hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves dont stick out and look weird this one does not have this problem it is a bit sheer but i dont mind wearing a cami with it it is flowy but not boxybaggie has a very nice flattering drape im    petite frame the  regular fits great im often a petite especially in pants and long sleeved tops but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length
these feel so soft and amazing i especially love that the length work for me just a tiny bit long and i am  i did find that they ran smaller than my pilcro and other jeans
i thought id be the exception  these pants are super cute  great fabric and color  kind of loved them  but they do run small  by about one size just something to keep in mind while ordering other than that  they are lovely wellmade pants
great dress that is very flattering works well with flats or can be dressed up with heels perfect for travel because the material doesnt wrinkle would highly recommend this dress
i really love the top but fyi its really an open front vest and the under tank doesnt come with it its nice because you can mix it up with different colors underneath but i think they should have noted that fact in case you werent prepared to receive half of what you thought you were purchasing
just got this dress in an xl ive never ordered from retailer before so i expected their clothes to run small i was wrong its a beautiful high quality dress but i think its just too big i may end up exchanging it for a l definitely size down in this dress
i almost passed this in the store but i am glad that i tried it i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a blouse feel and is machine washable yay love nice blouses that dont need to be dry cleaned i would describe the material as thicker so some may not like this for warmer weather looks great with a long necklace like the minuet i am typically a small and purchased this in an extrasmall and still have plenty of room
in love just wow beautiful colors although theyre dark you can still see all the variations the flannel is light and not too heavy theres visible black lace just below the shoulder pretty buttons ordered the large my normal size and its a perfect fit roomy but not oversized so well made i think this will be a favorite for years
im only  so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear size  end and bust  the small gave me plenty of room in the top the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i dont feel over exposed or anything the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet the long sleeve design is also awesome i have gotten numerous compliments on it the top has an inner liner
this is an adorably gorgeous swing dress the fabric is soft and flowy and everything a swing dress should be i was concerned that it would be too short but its the perfect lengthfun while still being classy a nice chunky eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully highly recommend
"i love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it got it on mega sale but i would have never paid full price or anything close the armholes are enormous showing bra and all i am not particularly large chested  and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me even with the huge armholes i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut designpros great pattern fabric pockets true to"
"i was expecting an ivorywhite cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit i am  lbs  and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m the sweater is at least  or  sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fitthe lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes not unpleasant but not as pictured as"
i got this in a l and probably i am a m however the waist pretty much fit but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way i dont think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust but a small waist
i can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste  its wide and not tailored at the waste  the key to super cute fit is to size down  then it will look like it does on the model in the picture i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture its super adorable in person the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate
i have been in love with white lace tops lately i saw in the description that there was a polyester lining  im really not into wearing a cami all the time as it takes away from the lace my personal opinion so im a little disappointed there there is no lining very pretty styling is a bit more swing
love this top so much its very unique and one of those tops thats effortless to wear i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written but i find it to be flattering and comfortable im glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium my usual size would have been too big
beautiful nightie looks like its really well made and fits really well im normally a size  and the m was perfect definitely recommend
i have this top in the blue print and i love it im super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top while the small did fit in al other areas it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust
this shirt was just really missing something for me i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection however the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking in addition the bow seemed to be too t

i took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat i admired this soon as it appeared  hesitant to purchase without any reviews nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance  i love the pattern burgundy wine faux fur collar the fit colors are true i sized up which i recommend glad i did this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate  length midknee imo not worth full price  eleveness does design pretty coats
fun  flirty feminine love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants just love highly recommend easy to wear
i love this romper so much im a tall girl  so often times its hard for me to find a romper that isnt too short the length on this is perfect this romper is an adorable design and the fit is great the material is a great quality and its really comfortable im   bra i usually range between an xs and s i went with the s on this one and it fits great i definitely recommend this if youre thinking about it
i love love love this top i love it so much i bought it in two different colors so i can wear it more often i think its feminine chic and classic ive worn it several times and i each time ive had more than one person comment on it i normally wear a small but they only had it in an extra small and i actually like how it fits which is why i think it runs a little large the only place that it is a bit small is the cuffs at the end of the sleeves i usually just unbutton those anyway so no

i just got this top and cant wait to wear it for springsummer it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side so trust me on this overall i highly recommend this top if youre looking for a muted but unique comfy top for the warmer months ahe
darling top lovely dark rich raspberry red color runs very large so definitely size down i ordered the s and m i am usually m but went with the small the s was smaller in the shoulders of course but not terribly it was only an issue when i hugged myself in the picture it looks like it fits her very well i dont feel like it fits me quite as well its borderline maternityish just a little too large and should come in at the waist just a touch more i agree the bow ie seems weak fa
i bought this in every color and would probably keep buying it if there were others  the fit is loose yet flattering quality is good feminine pretty ruffles that dont add bulk and i love that it makes me feel pretty and puttogether postbaby

this romper is so cute and comfy the fabric is soft and a beautiful shade of blue with light blue dots true to the photos i sometimes have issues with rompers due to my long torso but this fits great with shorts hitting about the same as the model image im  i really love the vneck on this too  its simple but a really flattering cut that i dont think would expose even ladies with a larger chest definitely a nice everyday piece  excited to wear it on a hot summer day at the pa
i absolutely love this top im always either an xsmall or  in mauve i think this top runs small i tried on an extra small and it was too tight in the chest im average in bust
i have been needing a rain coat and saw this one on sale so decided to try it on i do wish it was more fitted but it is pretty cute the embroidered detail is nice too bad the xs petite is sold out i have no idea if it will hold to the rain though
im   lbs i ordered a mediumregular the dress fell three inches above my knees this model is taller than i am and it falls to her kneesdoesnt make sense i think retailer sends petites in place of regular
although i am small size xs on top  waist this dress is not flattering if have any fat on your bodyi would not recommend it
bought it on sale and i am keeping it it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality however i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy  less hips smaller bust  as it makes me look slightly pregnant still i am keeping it to use on those days i just dont feel like dressing up for work i bought a large im a  but i think i couldve gotten away with a medium

i purchased this amazing tunic instore in the plaid pattern and couldnt be more thrilled with it i can already see myself overwearing it because its so pretty and easy i typically wear an xs and sometimes petite styles the regular small fits very well im sure the xs would have been alright but i like the way my forearms dont feel constricted where it buttons and sizing up seemed to help with gaping by the button holes i love the way this looks with a variety bottoms and shoes it
i tried this in the store and i liked it the color is very pretty and the fabric is soft and drapey and feels like good quality i like the little subtle dots i ultimately did not buy it because the tie at the throat is not my style and because i just dont need this kind of piece enough in my wardrobe at the moment but it is a very nice top and i would recommend it if you like the color and style
after reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xss was still wayyy too big for reference i am  and a  and usually wear an  but this thing was enormous it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon such a disappointment the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and im obsessed like previous reviews mentioned it runs a little small in the chest im normally a medium but am a  so ordered the large and it fits perfect with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what its a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well
ive got the postbaby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest ive looked in a long time fitted but skimming where i dont want to be accentuated  its a rare dress that can pull this off the cleavage is there so i think its more of a night dress but id wear it with a sweater during the day very comfortable
"i love the fabric however the overall fit did not work for me i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt"
i ordered both a small and a medium because i have lost weight and seem to be in between sizes currently lately i am anywhere from a  to a  in most retailer sizes almost  and  lbs i could have gotten away with the small but my bust size is  the small fit but didnt hang as well or feel as comfortable around the chest as the medium i agree with a previous reviewer that this romper does have a tendency to hang awkwardly at the waist until and unless you pull the drawstring tigh
"this is the rare metallic that  itch  really well made italy  lightweight   a total goi usually wear a large  but i bought a medium i tried it on in the dressing room  i  think it looks better  than oversized preppy  i wear a  bra  size "
i was excited about this   such a lovely look online but on meit was just meh im a little heavy right now so that could be playing into itbut i will say i loved the top part of the dress very flattering and subtly sexy but the bottomit just hangs like a rag it needs either more material for a swishier effector it needs to be a different material or maybe knit just doesnt work on me in the form of a dress the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzyi cant
the dress fits true to size and is pretty comfortable i did look kinda matronly with my  chest its a good basic to have on your closet but i ended up returning the one i bought it didnt feel special enough to keep
"i love maeve tops i love the material and feel of this brand when i saw the new tops that came out i ran to my local store to try one on im usually a large in a top once in a while an xl they only had a large to try so i tried it in the black motifi could barely get the top on it looked like i was missing  of the top i doubled checked the size and it was a largeits a shame the top is really cute if you are the least bit broad or busty go up a size or two if you are usually a"
i have been looking at rompers for a while but being that im  a lot of stores seem to carry rompers that are super short i think these are the perfect length for summer and for me its cute i am  and  pounds and i ordered the xs i docked one start because the top part seems to have a bit of excess fabric if i pull the waist up the top  balloons out a little awkwardly but if i pull the shorts down so that the drawstring is resting lower than my natural waist it looks okay
i loved this but it made my stomach look a lot bigger then it is i would recommend going up a size in it
i hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well im very petite on top xsmall and smallmed on bottom  usually dresses are tight on my hips  thighs and loose up top this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner formfitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places the xsmall and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the xsmall on this one i think this will be a staple winterfall dress loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac
this coat looks great but the fabric is thinonly partly wool the snaps also  stay shut very well  probably add a hookandeye closure for security despite its flaws it looks good enough that  a keeper when purchased onsale
"i love this tunic super flattering  long enough if your no super tall like me to wear with leggings it does run a little big i like tops a little looser on me so i didnt mind that i ordered a small if your typically a small and prefer more fitted tops i would suggest sizing down i bought the blue tunic first the pictures dont do the textile design justice i loved it so much i went back online and purchased this tunic in blackthanks retailer for being awesome"

i dont mind loosefitting clothing but to say that this product runs large is an understatement no amount of pulling tying pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body i guess if you try to taper it in with the strings then end result resembles a rounded beach ball very disappointed especially since the design on the fabr
i initially ordered the grey in a m per my usual sizing but on trying it on realized that the m was a bit frumpy and there was a lot of additional fabric at the back which tended to wrinkle very easily because it is cotton i sized down to a s and was much happier with the fit and the overall look of the jacket but i think this jacket may need some ironing once in a while the grey color is a darker grey as per the product description and the pictures
this tunic is perfect from the waist up the problems comes in with the pockets they make the tunic bulky around the hips and who needs bulk there the tunic is a little more gray in person than what it appears to be in the photo i usually wear an  or a medium ordered this tunic in a medium and i think it runs just a little big i may try this in a small if that doesnt work i may consider having the pockets removed in the medium just wish is wasnt so pricey for all the extra work but i
im so happy i purchased this cardigan every time ive worn it ive actually gotten compliments from both women and men i was slightly undecided at first due to its quite pricey but i think the quality is amazing and the pattern will actually last a long time as a keeper not just a quick trend im so happy i snagged it before it ran out i have quite muscular upper arms and the medium fits me well the sleeves do have some give in them and even though im also broad across my shoul
this tunic fits exactly as shown and is so comfortable the fabric is soft and buttery and the lace up front is a awesome detail happy that i went with the nondenim color because its a gorgeous rich color that i think will transition well from season to season love a good cutr machinewashable tunic
i was hesitant to order this but i am really glad i did it is just beautiful the quality is excellent i would like it to have more snaps so i am going to add them i cant wait to wear it
i love this tunic in the carbon color on the model the color does look different in person more of a lighter gray on me the tunic runs very large i am usually a small or medium but took the extra small in this and still have room i agree with the other reviewers about the pockets they do add bulk in the hip area so if this is a problem area for you id avoid this tunic overall its a nice tunic for everyday wear the tieneck adds a nice detail and makes the tunic stand out it looks g
this sweater is so lovely i like the fact that its not super heavy so you can be comfortable with a layer under it the embroidery is beautiful i usually get petite sizes when available but the petite m was sold out when i purchased i went with regular medium and am actually glad its not overwhelming or too long im  in my opinion if youre on the fence go for it totally worth it
and this one has a heavenly feel to it i know its not  cashmere but its soft and cozy i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutralcreme sweater perfect to take from fall into winter
"i bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing iti was worried it might look like a sack but i think it is both slimming and flattering i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves a winner"
just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and im in love i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow is perfect i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didnt have petites in the store i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere overall i am so pleased with this purchase so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it
when i first saw this in the retailer catalog i thought it was beautiful i am a sucker for floral prints and unique color combinations both of which this top has im   lbs and a small bust at  i usually wear a size  but it was a little loose all around so id say it runs big they had the size  at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation its a little loose but very flattering and very good quality i definitely recommend it if your shape is s
i love this skirt the colors and the softness i am little disappointed though that the skirt shrunk quite significantly in a cold water hand wash after the second time of wearing i dont know if it is the material but i followed the instructions for washing i am going to keep the skirt because i love it so much and hope that it might stretch a little out with wear and go back to its normal size despite the shrinkage i highly recommend
i love this shirt i wore it to a friends baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it the neckline and shoulders and very flattering but then im not very busty so maybe thats why it worked for me the material is handwash only but well worth it for such a unique pretty top i also didnt get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff
i ordered an xs regular and it barely skims the floor when im wearing wedges or heels  perfect its form fitting but not clingy and i think its a pretty comfortable dress glad i made the purchase
i bought this dress to wear to a funeral i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets the fabric lies beautifully on the body i would recommend this dress
this shirt is so soft and buttery it fits tts and just as shown on the model for the sale price this shirt is a gonga good goto shirt on those days where youre just not sure what to wear one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose so you can see your bra i think if you wear a black bra with it though it would be fine
"i love this dress its the right length and its very soft and comfortable it is not really denim just a soft grey material i tried on the blue one in the store before ordering the grey and found that the small fit better than the medium  im typically a medium usually in this brand i have to size up but in this case i sized down i highly recommend this dress is you are looking for a simple shift dress that you can just throw on and go"
i am a huge pilcro fan however these were beyond large i am not even sure that the next size down would work keep this in mind if you attempt these pants
like the other reviewers i opted for the grey version almost every tunic dress ive tried winds up looking like a sack when its on my body so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great the neckline is perfect  nice depth and addition of ontrend lacing  and the length love the shirttail hemline is also perfect the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag my only comment and its quite minor  id give this  stars if i could is that the pockets
birthday gift from my husband and i have it hanging up where i can see it the design is like a huge beautiful tapestry although it looks heavy the cotton has a nice feel to it handembroidered here and there i usually wear size sm and the med is very comfortable gorgeous
how can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size yet others say it runs small i think its because this jacket is cropped by the time i took advantage of the fall perks  percent discount the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s i also got the xs gray to compare sure enough the xs looks better but is cropped on me for ref im     lbs i dont really need another almost black jacket so im either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr
i love this jacket the color is what drew me to it and it looks just like the picture as far as sizing goes im usually a medium but i ordered a small and it fit well i feel that if i had ordered a medium it would look a little too puffy for my taste the small gives me a more fitted look
love the tegan tunic version of this dress i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong this runs so big i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on i highly recommend ordering at least  sizes down unless you want to look tenty
i dont own any peach outerwear because i didnt think it would complement my skintone this cozy bomber proved me wrong wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job thats eye catching great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe this is not a fitted style its relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist just like a regular bomber jacket i chose medium petite and it fits just right im a   
im happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me im  and  lbs and it made me look like i had gained  lbs as others have said the pockets make the dress even worseits very hard to get them to lay flat the material is lovely soft and i liked the gray color but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum
i see no one has reviewed this yet and since it is a beautiful sweater and only available online i thought i would contribute an opinion the sweater is nicer in real life than the photo it has a wonderful feel the style this sweater has very dramatic sleeves which i like though i could understand how that might annoy someone else it is made with a heavy thick soft yarn so the sleeves hang nicely i have worn it once and got complements so it is a sweater that while simple is also a stand

this dress is amazing i have a b cup and didnt quite fill out the top enough but that is a small tailoring fix i am completly in love with this dress and recommend it highly
"what the picture doesnt show is that there are pockets on the side seams that do add a bit to the hip area also the dress runs very large in my opinion i ordered a medium my usual size and everything was loose i am going to exchange it for a small and hope the proportions stay the same because its very prettyit is very boxy and kind of nightgown looking when its big so if you wouldnt want it to cling a bit this might not be a good dress the fabric is gorgeous and soft but be a"

im thinking that this might be a hit for the petites out there but it didnt quite work on my long torso the seam across the bust fell a little too high making the shirt ride up and the sleeve ended at a weird spot not quite  sleeves and also not long sleevesbut there is a band that makes it feel weird the vneck in the front is low but offered full coverage on my  bust but i can see it being pretty revealing on someone better endowed fabric and color is nice and its a prett
i first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater the stitch is pretty but the fabric isnt nearly as soft as i expected it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater that said the fit is pretty flattering i didnt have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model ive been looking for this style of sweater so ill probably keep it however it really didnt meet my expectations for quality
this sweater is super flattering love the cowl neck and longer length it is not boxy or shapeless but manages to show off your figure without clinging anywhere i did not find any of the colors to be see through as some other reviewers had noted  i purchased the navy and think ill go back for the brown as well  size down if between sizes  i am  and busty and the medium fit great
i really had high hopes for this sweater however unfortunately it is not as nice as i expected it to be i own a few angel of the north sweaters and i really dont feel like this particular sweater meets their usual standard first of all the yarn feels very cheap and is not very soft secondly the actual knit also appears to be very cheap i ordered the white sweater in my usual size medium and while it fits i really cant see how they were able to get the neck of the sweater to go off the m
i have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it and i am so happy i did the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fallwinter but it isnt overwhelming or overpowering fit is oversized as is in any poncho style sweater but it doesnt feel boxy or unflattering if in between sizes definitely go down i like things oversized and i went with the xss and it fits great this will be a go to piece for many years to come
absolutely lovely even better in real life this is not your typical cheap flimsy dress this is quality the fabric is interesting the color is gorgeous and the styling is flattering pay attention to the length  there are miles of fabric in that fortunyesque skirt and the model is very tall i am  and slim and ordered petite small and its a little longer on me than it is on the model i dont mind ive been looking for a specialoccasion dress for a long time and knew this was it
i really loved the look of this dress online and couldnt wait to try it on based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium following the petite size chart the dress was the perfect length for my  frame but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure im  and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress the fabric and lining feel great though i just wasnt the right fit for me
this dress is a beautiful color and is so lightweight and flowing will be perfect for a fall wedding that i am attending it is supposed to be loose so i think it is relatively true to size if not just a bit on the large side will look great with a kimono or other wrap when the weather is a bit chilly
"i agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that its a much lovelier color in person but thats about it for me thoughts belowpros tts i ordered the medium for my   frame and found it sufficient the color is much nicer in person as the other reviewer mentioned its a richer brown think mocha latte in terms of color the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it"
i disagree with the other review i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailermodel the sweater knit is lighter weight it is not heavy it fits more tightly to the body which i like the material is soft to me and navy color has a graytone to it i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y
what a classy special top really dresses up a pair of black slacks i actually think this is a perfect spring piece
i love these leggings  they look and feel great but i cant wear them out of the house there is no elastic in the waistband so they are constantly falling down i wont dare wear them out for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for style comfort and warmth they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire not for doing anything active
pretty detail fits nicely i feel it runs very tts its a lot though fuzzy and detailed it definitely takes over the outfit i wonder about shedding as well if you pair it with dark pants or jeans it would be gorgeous with simple winter white pants at a holiday event still on the fence i dont know if its for me
this sweater was just what i was looking for  it is so soft  comfortable  the design is unique and delicate yet doesnt shed or itch  the decorations are not as pure white as pictured there are several different tones of ivories  creams  i ordered the xs which is my typical size in retailer sweaters as i find that most run very large and this is no exception  it is oversize but not bulky  however the decorations do add some volume so maybe not for all body types
this is great soft sweater that is not to bulky lookingsometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow this sweaters knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments
i recommend with reservations these leggings are  wool soft not itchy light weight lovely knitted pattern they run large i sized down to a small the first time i wore them they were fine but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless they were falling down as i walked such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter so what to do at the price th
i really liked the fit and feel of these pants except the bottom of the pant leg was more bell shaped than i wanted bought white pilcro culottes last year and they werent like this but it wasnt a deal breaker when i got home i tried to pair the chocolate pants with something to wear in the summer but it wasnt working for me i think the color was just too dark and fallfeeling they do run big so id think about sizing down  definitely worth giving them a try if youre okay with the

i love this slip i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without i am   and the xs fits perfectly also i think it looks better in person
i love this top i got it thinking id wear it mostly with jeans but turns out i have worn it with a lot more it pairs great with cutoff shorts white jeans denim jeans i have worn it tucked in with high waisted jeans for a more polished look and also untucked for a more casual look i get lots of compliments on this top when i wear it i think it could be worn into fall with a jacket over it very happy with it
this top is a great addition to your summer wardrobe it looks great with jeansjean shorts its relaxed and comfortable with a super flattering cut the straps and low cut in the back add a touch of sexy as well
i really was uncertain when ordering these because linen can be difficult these are actually very flowy and soft i do think they run a bit large the petite sizes sold out so i ordered a regular  it stretched out a bit too much by the end of the day if thats the case you need to be careful because the hook and tiny belt are going to struggle to keep up you should consider ordering down if you are in between sizes otherwise the rose color is beautiful accurate to the website and work
i am    lbs normally a size  and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige the elastic waist on both is not a tight muffintop producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings in fact the elastic is very loose not very stretchy on either of the sizes i think the s had been previously tried on given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run
this sweater is gorgeous  the colors are beautiful and the piece itself is soft i do think it is a bit shorter than i would prefer and i tend to wear petites the sweater is nice enough that i do not mind

i liked the design and i didnt mind that is see through but i couldnt put it on  not size  what is my usual size  not size  or  even  my shoulders wouldnt go through the middle part and it is not stretchy  so disappointed i really wanted to like it
love this top it has a great retro vibe and the colors are great it is very soft and great quality i was in between a size xs and small i went with the small and wish i had gone with the xs i would definitely recommend this top
according to the sizing chart i should be an  or  i ordered a  but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage the one spot i dont keep any fat i brought it to the store to exchange for a  but i couldnt breath with the  on for reference i am  it was the  part that didnt fit the ddd would have fit fine i think
the liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over ones head it contains wool but is not in the least itchy in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric  it would be cute with a patterned bottom like a plaid or dotted pants as shown doesnt seem to be easy to snag
"i was excited to see this sweater in my local store i have been coveting it online it was just as pretty in person as i hoped it would be the color is vivid and beautiful i loved the buttons down the back i usually wear a size small but they only had an extra small i tried it on and liked the way it fit i wanted a snugger look i think the small would have worked too just a looser feelthe fabric is very soft now just waiting for cooler weather so i can wear it"

the top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see its not at all in person made with what feels like hospital scrubsmeetscrisppoplin this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out  think of a flared wide leg pant  but as a shirt the sleeves have a similar cut as well i too am a  and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you its s
super soft and cute the buttons add a nice touch the color depicted online gave me pause but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic great investment beautiful sweater    and the small is perfect
this is completely seethrough and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape fairly cute fit but not as a layering piece
this a heavy cotton which is great for fall design is cute and pockets are interesting the fit is boxy and can look bulky i only recommend if its on sale
it broke my heart to return this shirt the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big i dont think the xs would have made enough of a difference sad face
i really like this sweater i would suggest ordering a size up i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop
i purchased these shorts in a size  im on the petite side of things and the shorts are a little big the tiefront allows you to tighten the short i actually think the photo does a good job showing this item the color is a washed out gray and the shorts are not too short the fabric is light and this will be great for hotter days i like them
first comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small which is not in line with most retailer pieces i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close on top of being busty the material is thin and mildly see thru but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and noncollar top i decided to keep it

this dress fits beautifully the fabric is thick enough to feel significant and not flimsy but the dress doesnt feel heavy at all the detail is gorgeous but still subtle its a little too nice for me to wear to work but the perfect special occasion or party dress

"i fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail but the proportions are all off even the petite size is too long in the torso and the regular is laughable for anyone that isnt an amazon princess and im not even that short curvy ladies also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips i would"
"so when i first found this dress it was already on sale and sold out in petites for reference i am  and currently weighing in at about  and my bust is a  the store near my work has a petite shop thank goodness so i headed there after my day they didnt have it in my size but they did have the regular sizing in a  which i promptly purchasedthe crossed part sits a little higher than my natural waist but i think for someone with a slightly smaller chest it would hit spot on"
i am very petite   lbs and find this to be pretty formfitting not in a bad way  a rare feat for petites it is very comfortable  soft sweaterlike material and texture which does make the dress feel slightly cheap to me but it doesnt make it look cheap its also beautifully patterned in person pretty true to the online photo with the only difference being the dress is darker in person so i dont feel the blue stands out as much as it does on the online photo the length is

"tried it on in store its more of a cornflower blue instead of a true navy if you zoom in youll also notice theres a pattern to it i think it gives it a little something extra i may put gold buttons on it as the plain black buttons are a little boring  didnt buy it right away and came back with a survey coupon and it was out of stock had them order and freeship it to me from the store fit is nice and relaxed i like how it goes up in the back so it pairs well with dresses and"
i love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress unfortunately it just didnt work for me im a larger busty lady size  and i tried on the xl it fit fine but did absolutely nothing for my figure it just kind of hung on me even with the belt tie i still feel like it didnt accentuate my waist line i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure

i like these pants they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture the print is what drew me to these pants the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i dont think they would be worth it at full price
unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size for reference im   lbs  b cup and took an xs top fits comfortably no tightness around the chest and sleeves fullness isnt overwhelming the lace is see through so a cami is a must top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship i have not laundered it yet so i cant comment on that so happy with my purchase a keeper for sure
i have never written a review before and i love retailer and shop here often however i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money it is such poor quality it looks thick and flows in the photo it is very thin and it itches so bad i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail i will deff be taking it back and do not recommend it at all
"the fabric is very comfortable and softlove it  great fitttswould recommend"
i love this top in peach i usually wear a size  and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store it fits well but loose i usually front tuck it in what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders very effortless but doesnt feel like it is falling off a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders due to elastic in the shoulder this top h
i bought this top for my daughter the colors are so vibrant and the design and feel of the top is flattering this top can be worn with black pants for a night out with friends or with jeans or shorts to hang out at the beach my daughter loves it
"i had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silverwouldnt recommend it"
i paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop i am  lbs and the xs fit perfectly since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under  andor very short waisted the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all eveningand got tons of compliments as well
way too much fabric sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip  eek might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric but the extra fabric just piles up on itself the outer layer also doesnt feel like it will breath add the cotton lining and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer returning

the girls at the local retailer are big fans of coh  ive been thinking maybe i shld try them out i ordered these online in the size  as i am usually a  in skinnys i am a little hard to please or say hard to fit in skinny jeans i like a snug good looking skinny but not so much if its uncomfortable paying full price it is expected for the look  fit to be perfect even if on sale i wont go it if i think something is not right for me at   slender legs skinnys are either
"i am usually a small sometimes medium purchased a small and want to wear it off the shoulder but it is too tight and the fabric is scratchy it is a crepe fabric and although beautiful the hand of the material is not for meconfused if i should return or get a medium as the look is very cooli wish this had been linen or some more natural material but still recommend it as a good buy"
i was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest im petite   and purchased the xsp in white it is gorgeous it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp but i like the flowiness of this size i have so im keeping it it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully i love it the material is gorgeous and it is well made

i like the color and the plaid pattern on this top the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite i bought the regular length to pair with tights it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go the material also doesnt feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece as many reviewers have n

i am of average height but these pants are so long i considered altering them because i like the print but i dont think its worth the effort for workout attire so theyre going back shame
i love this shirt so much that i bought a second one even though they are exactly the same the cut and the fit are free and easy so comfortable and how many shirts are all cotton anymore washes well hang dry easy to care for i recommend this shirt for a casual look with style
not up to retailer standards fabric quite thinyou could see nudecolor bra through the white one and thin fabric wide bottom hung sloppy no way i would feel well dressed in this top i returned it
i love these pants they really make you look and feel classy i also bought the feather tank and absolutely love this outfit it is flattering beautiful and oh so comfy true to size
love this top the quality is great and the pattern is even cuter in person im   lbs and bought my normal size s which fits perfectly its pretty flouncy and roomy which is nice because it hides my postbaby tummy especially love how the back covers my bottom which means i can wear my skinny black leggings underneath definitely recommend
i tried on the xs in store would need xxs i think it is short enough to not need petite anyway the neck part was really bunching up on me between neck and girls it wasnt flattering the rest of the tank is really pretty and flattering though but the bunching was enough for me to leave it behind the fabric is soft and the color is nice warm neutral i love the lace back with the subtle layer of satiny looking fabric overall goo perhaps i dont have the right shoulder shape fr this
the white is completely sheer i am so tired of see through shirts even at the sale on top of sale prices i wouldnt recommend this shirt if the fabric werent sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back but it just looks silly with a tank top under it the cotton just doesnt lay right
i bought these pants online in blue and loved them so much that i bought them in the bronze two days later very flattering fit comfortable great quality and i look and feel like a class act wearing them theyre a bit of a looser taper style of fit but thats just the style and ive received so many compliments on them
i absolutely love this shirt its so easily dressed up and is still really cute just on top of black pants and flats great for the holiday season too i am normally a size medium in all tops i am   lbs athleticbuilt and the medium is perfect true to size definitely recommend
i got this dress on line  i ordered several sizes after reading the reviews it does run small i usually wear a  in dresses and needed a  i love the fit and it is a beautiful dress  however the little black pin dots are easy to snag i wore it once  didnt feel like i was wild that night  ha  but when i took it off that night it had  places where it had snags  ugh
i bought a pair in both black and green i sized up one size because of previous reviews i am happy with the fit they are very comfortable look good and keep their shape the only negatives are after two washings following the directionscold water no dryer the black has faded and the hook closure on one is difficult to close and the other was barely attached overall i would still recommend them
these pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me  i can go between a  and a  and tried the  and they were fine that said the fabric completed turned me off it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought theyd be the fabric is just too stiff and the sheen made them feel cheap unfortunately
tried one at the store love the look and feel of this pants so soft and flowy sizing runs large for reference im  and  lbs xxsp fits just right highly recommended
i purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought theyd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe on my second wear i happened to be on a longhaul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper outer thigh luckily id packed a backup dress the pants werent tight at all but the seams wrent strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess poor construction i would not recommend these
i look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size for some reason this fabric isnt working for me i think its the sheed combined with the stretch or lack there of of the fabric ill have to pass
i cant say enough about this pant the fit is perfect enough shape to hold you in but not so tight you think youre wearing leggings this is my go to business casual cant wait to get another color my store had this in black
these are super comfy and so flattering i feel like the picture doesnt do them any justice they would also look cute paired with wedges
"i like these pants a lot got one pair in blackand one pair in holly the green holly are just a perfect green so nice for the season they are very comfy and feel right all day without any saggingi highly recommend and would buy more if they werent on the pricier sideoh and great for causal but also dresses up nicely with some heels and a silk blouse"

you cant go wrong with these pants as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly i ordered a  when i have been wearing  in many other styles and was glad for the  i thought the fabric was all season so dont agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric i think its perfect everyone is different these are pretty close to yearround wearable
purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on when i got home i retried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right i took them back and tried them in the next size they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online

i really love this top i got the ivory and now i will probably get the black too if you get it in your normal size im almost always an xs and got this in xs its fitted and flattering the seam across the sternum makes it feel like an empire top which always seems to look good on me it is fitting in the chest and arms its really lightweight and has  sleeves so i will wear this even in summer
this jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension  i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer cant wait until cooler weather so i may live in it also when you have it on for a bit it seems to
i love these pants so much i had to write a review purchased the carbon color recently in regular length  the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me size was also tts typically wear size  and got  ive been wearing them often they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely ive been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season  i also think the quality is much better i will be getting them in more colors
i ordered the red motif in size xl for me the fit matches the model so i think its truetosize the only larger area on me is for the armholes i use a cami so my bra wont show when raising my arms since its made of rayonspandex and is a longer length its a little clingy along my hipline for my pearshape but overall its so soft and comfortable the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful prettier in person theres no problem with pattern placement either a great top for summ
i love the coral color allows me to add color to my neutral wardrobe very flattering i get a lot of compliments on them
i really didnt expect to like these pants as much as i do i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those but after trying both pairs on i realized how much softer and heavier these are i will keep the one pair of the pilcro but they did feel a little scratchy these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice i ordered a size  which is what i seem to we
it takes perfection for me to pay this much for a pair of pants and these delivered i bought these pants loveatfirstsight in the carbon color i have not washed them yet so i cant comment on durability but they fit like a dream i carry extra weight in my thighs and rear and these pants are very flattering and slimming and dont pull and crease in the crotch area like so many other pants do on my body my usual size fit perfectly and the length is great on my  frame i can almost
i believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description for me this tunic was just ok i didnt think that the quality was great and it just didnt wow me especially at this price point
the other reviews stated this was a shapeless top but i sized down and it is very flattering and cute the green is a bright gorgeous jewel tone it has an overall flowy bohemian look to itthe bell sleeves add just the right touch of boho overall i am very pleased with this top it will be a great transitional piece into fall
i loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them unfortunately after washing the turquoise one it sprang several holes the same thing happened to the second one after one wash i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer and they have washed and worn great i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately very disappointed
i love everything about this top the fit and style are beautiful and the fabric high quality it does run about a half size large im usually a size  and needed an xs in this top this is so versatilei have worn it with a tangerine midi skirt and denim shorts and it looks great however i pair it i highly recommend this
just beautiful dress it dits perfectly tts and i feel like princess in it highly recommend girls

absolutely beautiful top worn oncehand washed and thats all she wroteruined the black trim bled all over the top i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal do not recommend 
i tried on an xs and it was boxyroomy in the torso and the pocket on the wristforearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person it took me back to my childhood i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois shammy for short that was awesome for soaking up water and thats what it felt lik
the suit is beautiful however the white it is slightly seethrough on the bottom front even though it is slight to me that is inappropriateso i returned it regarding sizing i ordered a medium i usually wear a size   and my body is evenly proportioned throughout the medium was not tight at all but the back bottom region seemed cut just slightly less than full coverage i feel that i would be inbetween sizes small and medium but did not try a small due to the slightly transpa
i bought this in a beautiful cornflower blue at my retailer store i dont see that color for sale online the blue material was not thin or see through but perhaps the white is the fit is very structured which helps me cover my mom belly i have never said this before but i think it looks better on me than it does on the model wearing white on sale i got this for about  i got it for a steal i like the different directions of line patterns and the length is nice too one thing you cant
i was so excited when i saw this dress i love this color and the poplin sleeves i was so sad when i tried it on though the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips strange also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top
i would not wear this to bed  its almost too pretty ive been wearing this top under sweaters and shells as the weather is moving from winter to spring  i think it transitions the comfort of plaid into warmer weather perfectly it dips a little low on me in the front  so its probably not for more professional settings i like to wear it with a lacy bratype top peeking out underneath
weird fit and the tie just add to the problems i think id like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie the tie seems like an after thought its flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house  no matter there size i ordered a medium black and its already in the mail

wore this to my sons wedding found it last minute when i had changed my mind about another byron lars dress i felt awesome in it and got many compliments
this dress is so soft flowy and comfortable the material is very smooth and silky im hoping it holds up well over time with washing i am   and i ordered a xs the elastic waist is a tad tight but otherwise it fits perfectly  just as shown on the model in terms of length and how the top fits i said it runs a large because normally i would order a s but i think if i did it would be too long and the arm holes might be too big
i tried this dress on in the orange and loved it on me and felt it ran tts in my regular size small im a  but very petite body type otherwise and didnt feel like this billowed out as much as some other reviewers described it does have a loose feel on top which i actually like and inside there is a comfortable striped strapless top part that holds me in at the same time i liked the feel colors and lenth of the fabric plus i love anything with an elastic waist so i definitely plan on buyi

love this sweater so much that im going to order another when it goes on sale the material is not thick but its a nice thin weight that i still feel cozy in i love that its not long in the back too so cute and soft
this jacket is a great buy at the sale price drape is wonderful and the weight is nice lightweight and will transition well from summer to fall the adjustable ties at the waist make it very flattering on a curvy figure i purchased the white and am going to purchase the black as well definitely recommend
this jacket is pretty cute in person it is a nice thick gauzy material the black is more like a dark washed gray color while i do like the jacket i feel like it is cut a little wide maybe i should have ordered a size down i usually wear a combination of  and  and am usually between a small and medium i ordered this in a medium but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area im returning the jacket for now but might reorder in a small another time
just purchased this lovely sweater over the weekend during the  off sale i went in to buy the rona sweater in grey which i think is the same style with different name but it was all sold out the sa pointed me to a rack of these sweaters and i am happy with this choice the back print is really cute and the sweater design and color is very flattering it goes well with pants or skirt and the front is not as short as i had imagined the rona sweater to be
added this dress to my summer wardrobe in the rust color its a very relaxed dress easy to throw on as others have suggested in going to add a belt to this to add a little more flair but i love this designer but it does run large sizing down helps immensely

lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years now i will spend the rest of my day looking like im wearing an orange sack im not pleased

this fabric and quality of the skirt are superb there is a pretty metallic thread detail in the fabric that isnt easy to see online however the skirt is quite puffy which i suppose could be good for someone with a boyish figure looking to add curves but for many of us the extra puff might not be welcome one would want to wear it with a tight fitting top and emphasize a small waist in order to counterbalance the volume of the skirt could be a nice buy for the right person just be aware o
many internet reviews note that byron lars dresses run large and suggest that women  and under should size down and go petite i am  and  pounds and the  petite size was too snug across my back and too short when i sat down when i stood up i had to pull the dress down as it would bunch up around the hips therefore the size  regular ended up being a perfect fit no alterations needed i was searching for a dress for an upcoming wedding and for vacation and kept coming back to thi
this sweater is so much cuter than the online picture makes it look i think the model is wearing it too large anyway this runs kind of big so size down its kind of short in the front but it hits at a nice flattering spot love it
i love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model in reality the cut is more straight i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively if i sized down i think it would look better but im concerned that my shoulders will not fit the fabric is   wool and a bit itchy where its not lined the lining is a jersey poly blend the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat other than the b
i recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy if your body is more like the model this is a flattering dress for reference i am    and ordered the medium petite perhaps if i bought the nonpetite version or sized down maybe it will
this kimono is absolutely wonderful i originally purchased it for an upcoming beach vacation but have also found it to be a great piece for my wardrobe in both hot and cold weather goes with pretty much everything highly recommend
dress is pretty i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings nice but not nice enough to keep i am returning 
i couldnt wait to get this dress from the online order the fabric looked so interesting to me  linen appliquã© pockets raw neckline the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion its like a little a line tent the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head im going to return it and try for a medium for reference i am    and usually wear a six or a small
these are a beautiful color but run large i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me they are very low rise so i dont think ill be trying the smaller size cant even imagine them being lower also they are cropped thats hard to tell in the picture
i tried this dress on in a  and a  a  is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea the  fit in the outer layer however as the previous poster mentioned the lining is super tight i couldnt even pull the  lining down over my hips the  was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining not sure what when wrong here but its a shame because its a really cute dress
im not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small in my opinion it runs pretty large i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small i do have a small bust  and skinny arms so maybe thats why regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket

i tried this on in the store and came online for the petite size the length was fine on me its only the sleeves that would be better for me in petite this cardigan is very cute the dots are a bit more artylooking in person than you can see here  more like watercolor or ink spots which is a nice subtle touch i put runs small just because i think you might want to size up if you plan on wearing much in the way of layers underneath the merino wool is not itchy it is nice and soft i
i absolutely love this light soft cardigan i dont think the pic does it justice the black longer blouse takes away from it i wore it to work with a white button down and received so many compliments only wish it came in additional colors
i was too late to find my size in petite boo i tried the regular sizing and it was hugea total tent i am  about  i tried an xs it was gigantic to say the least huge everywhere i love that the fabric is thick but yet doesnt feel heavy or hot i think it would be the perfect summer dresscould wear casually or dress it up dont need a slip what a plus for a white dress i definitely needed a petite size and most likely from the size of the xs a pxxs really i know i have w

i have been looking for a black dress for a few events i have coming up this winter and have not been able to find anything suitable i have tried a few things from free people but being  everything there is just too short for these particular events when i saw this dress i had to have it it has the same feel as some of the free people dresses but the length is so much better the dress itself is sheer and not intended for extended outdoor wear but really beautiful on dress up with som
very nice polkadot pattern i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans it is a timeless classic
this is a cute fun addition to my wardrobe especially since i am a polka dot fan it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it overall it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants jeans and with dressier black pants for work
"the overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends intherefore i think the dress benefits from being styled  i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry this dress is more casual with its fringes  the jeans like material  although softer than cotton as well as the loose pullover style it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket casual sandals or even sneakers i have a  c chest and the l fits almost too loos"
"i really like this dress but after looking at the photo it doesnt look like this well at least on me granted i am  so that might be part of the reason but this dress is definitely trapeze style i love the look but am cringing at the thought that someone is going to think i am pregnant because of this a belt is a must plus it is the only way to achieve the look in the photos because it is a lot fuller in real life another nice touch to this dress is that versatility with the ru"
i love this cardigan i purchased it in the cream color however it did fray a bit after washing it other than that i think it was a great buy though
first this vest is made by elevenses i love this menswear inspired vest its simple and structured however its long on my  frame the price is also a little steep but it will add a nice touch to a simple outfit i plan on taking this to a tailor to take an inch or two off the bottom
unique vest modern chic i especially like the color block one the collar part i know it will become a staple in my working clothes and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes i dont think the back of this vest is of bad quality like another reviewer said overall its a hightquality piece
already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt great fun shape very flattering however the  panels were sewn using some type of hardplastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down you can literally feel it through the liner and im concerned that over time it might actually rip it very poor attention to details
"i tried this on at the store in black the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft but i would disagree with the previous reviews  i dont think this is flattering on all body types ive got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist it drapes straight down on the front so if you have a larger chest you end up looking like a football playeri think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest this would be very flattering"

this dress is adorable i purchased it in black and white to wear to my daughter s bridal shower i received so many compliments it was comfortable stylish and best of all wrinkle free i actually ordered it online and when i got it the dress required no ironing of any kind love it i think i may have to get in in the red also
i just purchased this adorable unique looking sweater at my local retailer store and absolutely love it as soon as i saw it i knew i had to have it it is super soft tts so i purchased it in my regular size small and it has the cutest pockets ever the little black buttons also add to the look but the black snails on the pockets are whats really so sweet on this one though im not a fan of snails in my garden ill make an exception for a couple of them making a guest appearance on this swea
i love this top the fabric is soft and a silky lightweight  perfect for summer i feel it runs a size large im   with broad shoulders i usually wear a medium but a small fit perfectly
i ordered the greenteal in size xl the fit on me doesnt match the model it looks looser on her i think it runs small at least in size xl it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt its a beautiful color of green too i think the vneck is too low so i wear a tank underneath this also helps with the transparent panels at the shouldersback my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s

i ordered this top in the white and cream color combo and love it so much the buttons in the back add a sweet touch  easy top for fall spring easy to throw a cardigan over and summer i ordered a medium but probably could have done a small classic retailer
well i wanted to love it and it was just too much i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be i also feel it should be fully lined it was not the exterior wool and pattern is very nice maybe if it was lined a smaller size would have worked better but for the price i needed more i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up i realize this isnt in the picture so no expectation but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines

this sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small and short it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on like i said great slip but id recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model
i have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute comfortable cotton undiesuntil i found these these fit like a charm are incredibly soft and dont ride up at all sizing in spot on plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style  yay
this is adorable light and breezy i felt it fit true to size leaning on the smaller size of a true fit i am normally an xss and went with the small fitting as it does on the model its a lightweight  cotton not a lot of give the v has a tendency to pull and probably will need a securing stitch which was obvious when it arrived from another store  i think wearing it with a cami is a great option considering it is flowy on the bottom and it is a thin cotton overall great summer t
love this sweater i almost passed it up online because i didnt notice the snails the sweater is navy and the snails are black they are so cute and such a fun and unique little accent the material is a moderate to lightweight sweater the length was perfect i have inadvertently purchased a bunch of cropped sweaters this year  this one is not cropped  yay the sleeves are actually a bit on the long side i sized up a little with the idea of wearing it over long sleeved tops i am typica
this sweater is way cuter in person the picture online does not really show the adorable contrast of the snails to the rest of the sweater also it looks like they photoshopped out the fact that the buttons run the whole length of the front really cute and soft not itchy highly recommend
it runs large but thats okay its great quality and super super soft i love the way it makes you feel so comfortable very disappointed the clip fell off
"i bought this during a  off sale which made it even more worth the price i would have purchased and kept it regardless but just got luckylooking at the pictures online i thought the coat was going to be red however when it showed up it is more purple i still like the color and did end up keeping the coati do think the buttons are sewn on well but i was surprised it did not come with additional buttons in case one gets lost these are very unique buttons so i cant imagine it woul"
this robe is such a pretty design very flowy runs slightly large in my opinion but was so cute i decided to keep it
i purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it online and ordered it in my usual size petite  im   and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on i immediately adored all the different prints on this one the length the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter its a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well also
"i really wanted to love this dress but i think the proportions are very weird im  and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a  in more structured dressesit runs small throughout and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work the front is nicely detailed but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing i tried on three different sizes   and they all pulled weirdly at the chest theres a little slip that goes with the dress w"

this was such an adorable print that even though it was a bit pricey i decided to splurge alas the fit just wasnt good it didnt look good on me and bunched up in all the wrong places sadly i had to return it ive bought swimsuits from seafolly before and recommend the brand due to the high quality unfortunately this particular style just didnt look that good on me
dress is made from a lightweight linen and is lined with a separate slip high quality with nice details and tts sleeves are average length length of dress feels appropriate on my  frame hookandeye closure at chest area to keep buttons aligned is a quality detail i think this is a lovely dress that can go from work to play
i am  months post baby and still have some body selfconfidence issues i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive this swimsuit does the trick makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat love this suit

this dress is a potato sack from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird and its huge on me so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not also the fabric is strange not at all what i expected im so sad  i was really excited about this dress
i think the description and image might be slightly misleading and is giving this dress a bad nameits not a drop waist dress as indicated in the description its a swingy a line silhouette more fitted in the bodice and swingy as it its bells at the hem which i find flattering another discrepancy is that the brand is hd in paris not glamorous however i happened to find an online return at my local store and liked the print so i tried it on and fell in love with the  retro vibe and pr
this dress runs a bit small in my opinion for reference im a  c and usually a  the medium is tight at the bust the material is beautiful but it looks like a petite cut on me the sleeve and overall length are too short and im going to return it
its the print that attracted me when i was in the store it is beautiful but i fear it demands darker skin and hair if you have problems with yellow then dont buy i dont mind the transparency of the fabric because it is not noticeable if you wear a flesh colored cami underneath because the fabric is light and the shape boxy it is meant to be flowing so i purchased my regular size if you have small breasts you would probably prefer a smaller size i only wish the blouse had been a litt
i just purchased these joggers online during the sale and bought them in my usual size small and they fit me tts im  and just bought the regular and the length on me is perfect these arent super thick or anything so i think theyll do just fine during the spring and summer months when i just need a pair of pants to put on really quick or just to lounge around in i find these quite comfortable and like that they have pockets too
i love these pants so much and have worn them so many times in a week they are comfy and causal but still chic and presentable these pants run true to size and are great for so many things running errands working out lounging around being casual and cool etc etc etc after buying these on sale and loving them i knew i needed more and purchased two more pairs i definitely recommend these for anyone who wants both comfort and style
i absolutely love everything about this top i got compliments the first time i wore it i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer the neckline and sleeves seem tailorfitted for my body i dont often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect lengthshape to be incredibly flattering theyre in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regularlength the neckline is equally perfect and hugs my curves beautifully wit

i absolutely loooove this skirt its just as depicted super comfy and warm got tons of compliments wearing it its just adorable the colors are really rich and the design if the skirt made it avery flexible to wear with different styles of tops and sweaters highly recommend

i ordered this pants in white and black i read the reviews and werent that bad i am  and  lbs i got them in size small they are way too big the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe  or  i have to returned them quality is ok looking on my opinion
fits perfectly i dont think this is too long and im a shorty great style  wish it came in more colors  i would definitely buy again
this is a fantastic sweaterreally soft great details but its huge im generally between an xs and a s at retailer and most always an xs with pure  good but this time even the xs is huge i wish they offered this one in an xxs i love it so much that i may keep it anyway its really comfortable and i love the style looks decent with my arms down like the models pose but when my arms are lifted out to either side it really looks huge ill have to think on this one
this shirt is incredibly soft i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back definitely size down the sleeves were a little snug but sizing down will help with the length and the bust my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over anyone can see down your top so be aware otherwise the top is great and perfect for summer
i absolutely adore this top the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews i am glad i did so i have broad shoulders and muscular arms and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders however it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material therefore i feel a large feels like a medium in the
yes  may feel like a lot to pay for a tshirt but this is one is worth it  i can wear this with everything i bought this in grey and the quality and style are just right to pair with a high waisted skirt or black skinny pants to wear out at night or wear with regular jeans and a cardigan during the day one of the best retailer purchases ive made in a while
love this top the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee it makes it easy to dress up or down the length is great not super long but not too short i ordered a medium and it fits well not tight and isnt baggy the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and doesnt feel stretched over my belly  or anything nice silky weight
"it was a little on the thinner side fabric a little more sheer that i would have liked i actually prefer that it doesnt have the straps in the back i didnt order it before until i read the reviews fit loosely the shirt is comfortable and the back is beautiful love bows tbu the front was just ordinary for the price even on sale i didnt feel i absolutely needed it but if you are looking for a hite tank it is pretty cute ivory not pure whitexs  lbs  dd"
i bought the mauve color and its very pretty i felt as though sizing up was a better choice im usually an xs or a small and i went with the small i liked the length of the small better the shoulders add a cute look to it
"i bought the lavender in my normal large the fabric drapes wonderfully and does not cling to my midsection the texture of the fabric is much more interesting than the photos online show there is beautiful shimmer tot he heather in the color in my lavender shirt there is pinkgraylavendarwhitesilver depth to the fabric i plan on getting at least two more colors i recommend washing all shirts like this in a nylon bag in the machine then line drying i have done this for years with al"
i ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top while they are the same price they arent even close in quality this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen the trim pocket and the laceup tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didnt lay right and the tag sewn inside was sewn with red thread and showed through very visible i don t think it would hold up after many washes i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev
i ordered this in a l online and wasnt a fan when i received it the colors are pretty bright but they also look cheap in my opinion it also had an awkward fit because of the material there is no give at all it was really tight on my chest  for reference and it was also pretty short and im short it barely hit the top of my pantsand im  back it went
this duster is very nicely put together and is midweight im not sure its worth this price point but its not cheaply made either the colors are as shown on the website to a t the length is also as shown i am   lbs and  and the small is perfect i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect colors are dark teal salmon and gold this is a three seaso
i saw these in the store and was smitten ordered online and have not been disappointed love the pattern the feel and the fit comfortable fun and interesting the regular length ones are definitely fulllength on me but not too long i might have gone with the petite length except that they didnt seem available but am perfectly happy with the regular length
i was fortunate to buy one of the last petite mediums in this style the knit is soft and comfortable and doesnt seem likely to snag there are a variety of stitches through the upper areas which add subtle differences the colors are fantastic this will be great for the cooler months it looks fabulous with denim
this sweater is so unique not for the faint of heart but its beautiful hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired the colors are saturated vibrant love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back the front material is slightly stiffer i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but im willing to overlook it will be a great sweater for the holiday season wear it with a skirt jeans skinny cargos endless possibilities
i normally wear an xl but could only find this instore in size large the blouse fits nicely but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size the blouse itself has a nice drape to it the black railroad tracks look very pretty in person and add a nice detail the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl

really fantastic shirt ordered multiple colors and will keep them all the gray especially looks a bit boring online but is gorgeous in real life it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty neckline is interesting wish the front was a tad shorter im  but dont think petite will work really really great shirt
like the idea of this shirt so much but the neckline was still way too low the top of my bra was visible wishing the under layer really covered as no way im going to another layer to an already layered shirt might just be my body type so might work for someone else but sending back
i adore a well made and well fit tshirt tla always delivers this one is no exception fun swingy and light the tie on back is a fun little addition and the length is perfect im  and always prefer longer tops the swing in this one gives it a great length love the colors but decided to stick with basic white id love this in black too highly recommend
i love the print and design the photo does not do it justice i fell in love with it in the store but could not find my size i ordered my size online but it was still small and short it came up to my waist and was tight in the shoulders and waist i really wish it wasnt so small i love love this top the colors are vibrant and shiny totally my style i highly recommend it if it fits
this caught my eye in the store because of the beautiful bell sleeves so i had to try it on i tried on an xs and small to see what fit better for me i am  and about  lbs the xs fit better i usually do take an xs in tops i wore it out recently with a pair of distressed jeans and it looked great as with most of the items you see online it is always better to see it in person as the pictures do not do it justice the material was nice and flowy i did not feel the neckline was too low
i really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining so its a bit see through under the light also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt i just think that with this kind of price the skirt should come at least with the lining otherwise its beautiful skirt flowy and very feminine
super cute tshirt keep in mind to is fairly long
i washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt i dried it on medium i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly i loved the color lilac fit and style when i received it and immediately put it on so sad about the shrinkage for a  shirt i expected a bit more retailer should suggest air drying the shirt so bummed and disappointed i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time

i ordered this top despite the other reviews and im very glad i did it is adorable well made and very flattering i am usually a size xs or  but based on the reviews sized up to a  fits perfectly not snug at all highly recommend
i just purchased these pajamas online and they are very pretty in person i found them to be tts in my usual size small though a bit on the long side as im only  i dont mind a little extra length though because these are just to loungesleep in i think these soft pjs will be great during the warmer months as they are very light weight and comfortable youll absolutely love the print on them and wish there was a matching top

i love this dress it is amazingly comfortable and flattering i would think to many body types i have a more athletic petite body build and this dress gives me great curves i have already received so many compliments while wearing it out the best part is i can wear it to work im a teacher and then wear it out by easily dressing it up
the back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt it is very visible and looks terrible  especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt do not recommend
i was bummed about this top detail on back is pretty even so not worth it im usually an xs im   lbs and it fit true to size guess i had higher expectations im feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person
"made by dawn suits are the bomb the bottom is a tiny bit cheeky but not thong territory just enough side leg to be seriously sexy the quality is fantastic soft with nude lining love the retro feel to the high neck top enough support even for my  so comfy i forgot i was wearing it at lunch the normal triangle tops cut into my shouldersneck and this style does not amazing quality and well worth the pricefyi large top fit perfectly but i needed a medium bottom"
the dress is lovely my only knock on it is i didnt really feel like the top and the skirt matched in terms of level of dress i guess the top just wasnt fancy enough for me but it is a very beautiful skirt i wish it was in a tea length the fit was spot on
i got a medium as i usually wear that in everything i am a  and this pulled a bit across my chest and back it is a cute idea but the fit is off for my body i am  and hits me shorter than shown on the model so hits at an odd length i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me the teal blue color is beautiful the pink is more a blush and washed me out the grey is just grey i bought three thinking this would be my go t
cozy and beautiful  everything dreamy sleep pants should be great for gifting make bedtime feel a little more pampered
bought this cardigan on a whim as a birthday treat pre myself love it i get a compliment everyone i wear it the quality is great fits great with a roomy feel
i got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater it is extremely soft and warm but not bulky at all it lays really neatly which is why i think of it more like a coat this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring keep in mind though that this does not button  theyre just for show

"love this jumpsuit i was rather apprehensive as i didnt think it would look as good on me as on the model but i am totally smitten with it very flattering especially if you have some bumps and rolls i ordered in a medium  and  lbs and it fits perfectly definitely recommend to order down as im wearing it to yoga i wear a sports bra underneath that also helps with the very deep and open back to cover up a bit more highly recommend the top hits in all the right spots to make one"

i first saw this sweater coat in the retailer catalog that i got in the mail i thought it was beautiful so ethereal i never thought that i would own it though because of the initial price i never thought it would make it to clearance to my surprise it did and then went the extra  off i took the plunge i followed the advice of the other reviewers and ordered a size down a small i am glad that i did i still feel like i get the oversized wrapped in warmth feel it is not a figure fl

the blue color is beautiful and what attracted me to this sweater the draped front is very flattering and the fit is true to size unfortunately the banded hem creates a pouching effect that is very unflattering i really wanted to love this sweater but just cant figure out how to wear it without poofing i think this is the reason it is tucked in in many of the model shots it is still a pretty sweater and it may work with for some
i just received this today by mail i am going to keep it as the reddish color is really pretty it is very lightweight and will travel well for my summer vacations however my first observation is the same as was noted in a previous review  not quite sure how to keep this dress in place  as soon as you move your arms around the dress goes out of place  and it slips back onto your shoulders  hopefully it will work out will try a couple more times before i make a final decision i think
"i agree with a prior reviewer who stated this seems overpriced  it is its very lightweight and not quite the quality i would expect for the price the washing instructions tag was sewn in all crooked  really i ordered the black as i was hoping to wear this to a dressy though not formal event but i am not sure it works on me i think it would be a really fun summer dress option in either of the  colors the blue looks really pretty onlineit is very cute but definitely runs large"
loved this sweater coat the first time i saw it onlinethen the priceyikes the style color and fabric design is beautiful waited for it to sale and then hurray an extra  off to my local store for a try on as i would not have wanted to even try it at the regular price it is wonderful it runs very large i went down two sizes to achieve the fit i was looking for from a large to a small in my opinion the product shot model is wearing a size too large even sizing down it is not t
i agree with the other reviewer this is classic retailer oldstyle quality the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloonfit of the waist i usually choose sm in cardigans for ref   lbs  but even the small of this sweatercoat dwarfed me i think it just depends what you are looking for unique it is and certainly lovely
im surprised to be unhappy with this reading all the rave reviews but i had a different experience with it the cut is funky and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture i think if youre very slim this may work well but for any curves or hips not so flattering imo i think its a pretty jacket but not for me its going back and ps i paid  for it and see its on sale for about  that just a week later the discounted price may be a good de

when i received this dress in the mail i was thrilled i loved the color and the style although a bit too much material but comfortable when i went to show my husband the dress his first comment was very sexy i can see your underwear and your skin i dont understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it
this is such a lovely piece i usually wear a medium in moth i am  pounds and  the quality is exceptional i highly recommend this sweater coat
this dress is so beautiful i am   and smaller on top larger on bottom size  is perfect was worried that it would hit me in all the wrong places happy to say it does not wore it for the first time yesterday and no lie i received no less than  compliments from strangers just walked up to tell me how great the dress was colors are so soft and beautiful would buy in other colors if they had it i can see myself wearing it to a casual dinner to a wedding our just to feel special on
this sweater is very pretty but the material is extremely thin the blue was ok but the white is nearly seethrough the design is unique but unless it fits really well the bottom hem where it crisscrosses can bunch out in a weird way i got my usual s and it was rather loose causing this to happen i suggest you size down if you want it to look smooth like it does on the model
i was very excited to get this dress in the mail i wasnt sure about the sizing because there werent any reviews written yet i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine but there was just so much fabric below the bust i love that its different but i think youd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you it does not flatter your body at all
this dress is beautiful i love the collar and tie neck detail i decided to order up a size and am very glad i did i normally wear a  or  petite and ordered this in a  petite it fits perfect with a little roomnot snug at all which i like the description says its a slimmer fit so im happy i ordered the size i did im excited to wear it and add it to my wardrobe
these are the perfect combination of comfort and beauty i highly recommend
this is the best dress i received it last week and have already worn it three times perfect fit casual and so easy but the length and front details make it so fun thicker than many other tshirt dresses but light enough that i wasnt overly hot on super warm days def recommend
i recommen only becuase i like it on other people but not on me the pull on style didnt work i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist but the waist wasnt elastic enough to pull up i have lets say a booty i kept hearing hte stiching give it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae i am  and it stuck more out than on the model nice idea btu not for me i am  lbs
i love the way these pants feel on they are so comfortable and breezy i love that i can feel cool in the summer without showing a lot of skin i purchased both colors both are very nice looking that said im not sure if i will keep them they wrinkle something terrible im pretty casual person and it even bothers me it probably wouldnt be so bad if there werent pleats in the front after sitting for just a few minutes the pants look like a disaster in front my husband said its not ext

loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on its a gorgeous shade of blue denim not navy with some light tiedye streaking along the top and sides which add interest the bat wing feature is a little limiting i wont be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me as for the material its an interesting blend bc it isnt soft or rough some may say its itchy and some may say its soft to me it isnt either its merely smooth enough which sounds terrible it
i am so glad that wide leg pants are coming back i love this style  so flattering the color on these blue is rich and unique and the fit is exactly what i was hoping for i wanted them loose and low waisted and they are perfect i am   lbs and ordered  petite the length listed at  is spoton with flats no tailoring needed i previously ordered these in white in  r they also are good but a little too loose and will need hemming def recommend and hope retailer keeps this st
"love this dress im wearing it as a bridesmaid in a fall casual outdoor wedding i think its fancy enough and can also be dressed down later im  tall and skinny with large breasts and this dress fits beautiful not too much cleavage its not real lace but no one could tell great quality and nice weight to dress great for dancing and spinning"
these culottes are fun i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs in my opinion they run big i am usually a small   waist  hips pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend but with a longer tank or shirt they looked fine the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down so far wrinkling isnt a huge problem but well see i am   tall and these fall about the same place on the modelmid calf they looked grea
i love this skirt i have it in black and when i saw this color i was so excited to add another one to my wardrobe these skirts are made  well its not flimsy at a all the actually color is more of a light aqua blue so if you are wanting a baby blue might not be for you
i tried these on in the store and instantly fell in love with them  they have an elastic waist which for my shape pear can sometimes be bad but these pants dont cut me off or accentuate the fluffy parts but lay nice over my belly and legs in a flattering way they do have a slit that goes the whole way up the leg that the picture doesnt show but the underneath piece of fabric wraps around your legs so i think it would be hard to show too much i bought a medium and they hit lower on
its just ok very thin and feel like it might say and stretch color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted
this top is super cute and colorful admittedly i have not used it just as a pajama top because i think the world deserves to see this piece of art super comfy and i recommend this for everyone in most shapes and sizes

" ive been waiting forever for these to finally arrive i was a bit disappointed im  tall  lbs and  my normal size  fit me perfectly if a bit loose they fit a lot like the hyphens the legs are short and wide they hit me at the ankle which made them look like high waters on me the legs are very very wide and i didnt think that was flattering on me same comfy fabric and fit as the hyphens except the front seemed to dip low at the waist i"
purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing helpful for visitors and children  i purchased a s as it does run a bit large
im being eyeballing this dress for quite a while finally i decided to jump on it and i was so ansy to receive it in the mail finally arrived and some how wasnt what i was expecting the front part has  pieces of fabric attached to the sides of the dress that wrap around your waist making that effect you see on the model to be honest i didnt like that at all i think they ruined the dress with that the dress is very comfortable feeling the fabric is super soft i can imagine wearing this
"love love love these pants i have yet to remove the tags and wear them but that shall happen over this weekend the fit is comfortable and while the pants are not oversized they are very generous in the mthat i purchased the colour that seems to confuse more than is few is really a great combination of a black or navy stripe depends on your lighting and opinion here with tobaccokhaki on a white ground the pleats at the topjust add to the great design and i like that they sit"

i have been on the hunt for a black pencil skirt so i decided to give this one a try based on the previous review i love it i didnt size up went with   in waist   ish inches hips the waist is fitted the stylist said when she tried it on it pooched but i didnt feel that way on me i had a simple tshirt on and it looked so cute the petite length was also perfectly on point the lace part hit me above the knee and the lining a little over that  perfect and flattering
i love these jeans the fit is much better than the white pilcro hyphen slit jean which is cuts lower nice weight not to heavy and not too light in weight these look terrific with the vanja peasant top in the yellow print a darling outfit the lace give them flair and dress them up so i can wear them to work highly recommend
"i bought the calia tunic in blkwht and in red motif i love the black and white one the cut is flattering and stylish comfortable you can dress it up or down all good the red motif is cut differently the neckline is very low the shape is different from the black and white one i am not sure why but i returned itneither shirt is as long as the one pictured on the model i would recommend the black and white one though"
"i love bowsthis dress is very cute and flattering while being comfortable it may be sleeveless but i think with the right boots and cardigan it can be brought into fall easily color is a nice green i tried on both the  and  and though i loved the fit of the  better width i preferred the length of the   otherwise not much difference there i think it is well worth keeping it even though i dont need yet another dress material is pretty comfortable too back is lower"

ditto on the oversized comments am generally a large in tees and sized down to a petite large and probably could fit nicely in a petite medium the stitching on the neck and front design are adorable a bit long but great potential for layering to showcase the writing on the collar or cute design on the front  think its a keeper
i bought this in the black and white and like it a lot i typically wear an xs or s and purchased the small glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth its a little low cut for me but ill wear a cami under it
i wasnt sure how the fabric would be since i ordered it online but i wasnt disappointed its got a lot of movement which makes it really comfortable while still being cute its a little longer than i anticipated but i dont mind that it just gives it a little more versatility also it has pockets i love pockets so maybe im a little biased
i got the orange motif skirt in s im  and  so it fits snugly but doesnt need hemming which is great when youre petite i love the design and that it has pockets but its a very full skirt and seems to visually add a couple of pounds to your middle if you have a shirt untucked over it but its beautiful worn with a tighter shirt tucked in the color is more red than orange to me as well which is a plus
this was my favorite piece in my order it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors they dont i voice the other reviewers opinion get more colors in of this style i would order in a heartbeat i plan on wearing this to work its freezing in my office but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look the material was soft woven tightly a good thing and well made good one retailer definitely a keeper

i was so pleased to receive this dress after purchasing it online  the color is vibrant the lace is beautiful and it is fully lined fit is true to size and its a fit and flare dress so flattering for most body types i could dress it up or down for lunches or weddings so overall i think its a great dress for a great price
despite other reviewers comments on size  i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it im typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit id said for more for a b if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it a final comment on this suit  it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed it was reticketed and it didnt really feel brand new when it arrived

i love this suit and have gotten so many compliments on it i weigh  lbs and ordered a s typically i order xs but am glad i went with the size up the coloring is beautiful the legs are high cut  flattering the top has no padding and shows a seamless result highly recommend
these are really stunning they look exactly like the picture with the pattern matching up perfectly at the seams i love the mirror image pattern theyre just a bit snug where at first i thought i might not be able to get them on but once on they actually fit perfectly so i think thats actually how yoga pants are supposed to fit im   and i got the xs
i purchased this for a recent trip with my friends and thought it was worth the price the swimsuit is comfortable yet flattering and all the patterns are really unique i received a lot of compliments about the swimsuit the one downside was that the fabric hook for one of the straps broke so i had to sew it back on other than that this was a great purchase i recommend this to anyone who wants a very whimsical but comfy swimsuit
great quality and works in many ways highly recommend
i wore this to a gala and i plan on wearing it over and over again the dress is very comfortable and looks polished i wore this dress for  hours and did not want to take it off the embroidery is beautiful and appears to be well done i am  and the dress hit me  inches above my knee i highly recommend this dress i received so many compliments
this dress is gorgeous but if you have a larger bust size i would not recommend it unfortunately it was not available in any nearby stores and i had to order online the low cut looks cute on the model but realistically with a chest it ends up looking a bit too revealing i am bummed because the dress really is beautiful
this dress is well made great fit perfect aline the bust was lower cut than shown in the picture but it fits well even with a large chest completely flattering and i would highly recommend
this is a great dress i feel like it hides any imperfect spots including some armpit fat or belly fat i have gotten several compliments on this dress because the stitching for the flowers is very high quality
i got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person but its not too much of a difference this is a really cute thong and if youre just trying to be sexyromantic then i think it would be fine and theres nothing at all wrong with it however i like to wear thongs just in general because i think theyre comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines and this is definitely not the most comfortable the front pattern

this is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress really love it however theres no way that model is   in the photo because im  inches shorter than that and the dress is  inches shorter on me its really not a dress its a tunic im happy with it because its so pretty but i did think i was buying a dress i just wore it with leggings and im happy with a beautiful tunic
"interesting slightly transparent fabric neckline is not so open as pictured body is boxier than picturedwould recommend as a maybe"
this dress is lovely in person light rose color and quality fabric im a  and had to go down from my usual  to a  to get a proper fit in the bust and bodice the full skirt leaves plenty of room to size down if necessary this would work best on someone with a larger bust and small waist but because of the cut i recommend trying on before buying if you are smaller busted the front tie can be adjusted slightly to get a better fit the skirt portion is unlined though the fabric is thi
i love this dress i didnt think that i would feel at ease as it is very formfitting but it is so comfortable and warm it is dressy yet casual i have received many compliments

i love this dress length falls as shown on model im not sure if this fits true to size or not i am normally a medium and kinda wished i would have ordered a large i find that the neck is too tight and have to loosely tie it also the lining is smaller inside and it ends up causing the arm hole areas to roll inwards so i feel like the back end up being sort of cape like its rather weird the large may have too much material though but overall i still love this dress minus those few fla
im always looking for easy casual items that will withstand being washed a million times and i think this one will fall into that category its a nice thick knit  durable yet soft and sooo cozy length is fantastic for leggings ill basically live in this on weekends
i tried on the xs in store i typically need petite and it was a great length for me i think petite would be too short for me to wear to work the xs was a little snug on the waist but the rest of the skirt fit perfectly so though it was snug i think i would still buy the xs stretchy band the cream colorivory is a nice summery color not seethrough unless you have dark unders flirty and overall nice and airy for warm summer days  lbs  inches waist

although true to size i sized up to improve pocket placement and for a longer and slouchier fit like on the model the pockets in my regular size were almost too high up and made my midsection look bunchy
i would buy these pajamas in every color if offered they feel wonderful to the touch and even better on
i bought these for a trip to the caribbean i sweat a lot if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat i will spare you the photos
joggers are my new style this springsummer i think i love the simplicity of this style the cut is perfect very true to size i like the longer length  perfect to wear with kitten heels flats or slip on canvas this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit
wanted to love this love rompers but the opening between your chest was oddly designed it was gapping and certainly couldnt bend over without showing lots fabric seemed heavy for the summer all in all it was too full made me feel frumpy
i was very happy to see these longer length shorts i have  pair of the shorter ones and loved them last summer so i ordered them immediately i am curvy and wear a  in pilcro and ordered the navy which is a lovely color and will go with everything i think they fit great and i like the fact that they are a looser style i will buy more when they go on sale
love the texture and color of this tunic it does seem to run large  i could have probably sized down to a pl without an issue i do agree with other reviewers that the pockets are strangely placed and add bulk im going to have them removed overall i really like it and have already worn it multiple times
i am very petite however fuller on top  this top looks fabulous it is cut in such a way that every part of your body looks slimmer goes with jeans dress pants of skirt i highly recommend
i grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress and it left me puzzled  the print was pretty but no amount of tailoring could save it for me  it was wearing me  maybe it could wear three of me  i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners by making a garment without details no installing more time consuming zippers buttons or snaps and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it
yikes there is a whole lot of skirt here i am  weigh around  lb and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing depending on the designer this skirt balloons out from the waist on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking the skirt is very long hitting way below midcalf there is also tons of material  creating a parachute effect definitely returning
i love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their  off sale i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isnt even silk or a better material but once i got this i was so disappointed i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloontent on me i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way i dont even want t
love this dress i think i scored the deal of the year with this one found it in my local retailer store it had been in my save for later forever but i couldnt bring myself to pay full price then it sold out in my size online i was in my local store browsing the new items on sale with the additional  off and there it was  and only  and my size i picked it up noticed the cut outs that are not very apparent in the online photos but it back picked it back up put it back
at  i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off the colors are so pretty for summer but there is just too much fabric i felt like i was wearing a giant doily however there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this
really beautiful dress too special for me as a guest at a wedding i think this can be used as a wedding dress in an informal intimate wedding it is shift dress so not accentuate your body which is to be expected it is running small with my athletic body especially up top the chestarms are tight i could have gone a size up but the body might be too big i unto lately returned
when i received this top i thought it was even prettier than the online picture the colors and beading are more vibrant in person it is a full cut and does have an elastic band at the bottom but i liked the way it looked on i ordered my usual size m and it fit me the same as it did the model in the picture it is pretty shear if you wear it to work or during the daytime it will need a cami however in evening lighting i dont find it to be that see through and i feel comfortable wearing
"havent decided if im going to keep this dress yet it arrived torn at the seams but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted in my opinion it is not worth full price i would say it runs tts im between and  and a  and the size sp fit perfect however the petite size runs pretty long it says  inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with  inch heels mine may have been a wrong size marked issuedress looks exactly as in the picture"
this top came down to my hip bones but i am shortwaisted the shirt definitely fits shorter than in the photo the measurements listed for regular seem to be a bit shorter than the  l measurement i got when i measured it i think the quality is nice and though it could likely easily snag if youre not one who is used to wearing delicate clothing i didnt find this top to be flimsy at all for reference i purchased a l and the fit is more formfitting on me than it is on the model but n
i dont know what it is about this top but i was so drawn to it when i saw it in the store its totally see through thats the design and i think its great i wear a cami underneath but if youre more daring or you spend a lot of time by the beach you can get away with a nude bra or bikini top this definitely runs small im   and usually wear xss but felt most comfortable in a medium the body isnt tight or anything its just on the shorter side especially if you have a longer t
very soft and comfortable great for girls who dont usually like shorts because of biggermuscular thighs i would say these run large but not drastically for reference im usually a size  on the bottom and i got a small the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house
the pattern is pretty subtle almost looks like one color so it is more versatile as i would have originally thought the fabric is so soft the collar is removable but i love the look with it on the way it closes is  lobsterlike clasps so you can wear it closed or open sizing is a bit big as in the xxs p fit me perfectly didnt even try on the xs p this will keep me warm and looked nice with a pant outfit i tried on as well as a dress recommend sizing reference  lbs  
i bought a size s in the navy and m in the neutral and both fit i usually wear a small but they only had the size m left in the neutral the m is a little big but the extra room fits the flowy bohemian style of the blouse so it works i love this top and am glad i purchased it in both colors definitely recommend it
i love that this top is dressy yet comfy it is perfect for work and relaxing with friends after i recommend purchasing this blouse
i love this dress the pattern is unusual along with the mesh cutouts im a sucker for mesh cutouts it does look a little bit like a maternity dress but eh who cares let them think what they want i recently wore it to a casual outdoor wedding and received many compliments i knocked off one star for quality because the back of the dress where the zipper stops needed to be reinforced by hand to keep it from ripping this is a common problem i have with retailer dresses and no im not trying
this blouse is perfect for semi dressy occasions silver ribbon adds a nice subdued sparkle accent and no need to add a camisole due to the nice lining
this maxi dress is exactly what i had in mind the fabric is very comfortable the print is very nice perfect find
beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on as the other reviews state it is short and wide i like the top so much i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box 
these pants lived up to expectations the fabric is very soft and did not wrinkle in the dryer i am normally not a big fan of cropped styles but love that these have the gathered leg and can be styled dressier or casual i thought the cargo pockets might stick out too much but they lay nicely i feel i will get a lot of use from these and the best part is they are not constrictive and they are super comfy
"in my opinion for this amount of money the dress needs to be something really different and this one isnt it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality summery material dark color flirty and funbut overly conservative up topinitially the top portion is extremely sheer youre saved a bit by the extra fabric at the front but it still seemed odd that the top isnt lined  particularly for a dress meant for wintertheres too much going on up top th"
this dress is absolutely lovely from the neckline to the fabric really feels like a well made dress i will say that it ran larger than i thought though so keep that in mind it is more of a shift dress than the pictures suggest still gorgeous though

i adore the tiny brand blouses this one is lovely and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy embroidered material very pretty indeed this probably is equally stunning in the nude color but it doesnt show well somehow online the navy is certainly amazing and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off the large fits me perfectly although i am a medium in most all other tops    
"i really wanted to love this coat it is well made and unique i usually buy the petite versions but they were sold outhowever i went ahead and purchased a regular size because i wanted a second winter coatsadly it looked more like a cocoon coat on me it stuck out at the back probably because it was not a petite it pulled across my chest like shoulders were too short for reference i am  feet  and a i didnt mind the fluffiness of the top portion and the tie is useful for"
"i should have paid closer attention to the other reviews i could barely get this blouse over my head after getting it on the armholes too are very small the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck i tried the small but think a medium wouldnt have been much better it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair if you have a tiny head and pencil a"
"the orange version is very nice bright but not tacky the fit is super flattering and i love the crisscrossed hem the top part is also flattering on the shoulders halter but need a strapless bra the  fit me well no need for petite on that one might be too short for me  in waist  lbspattern is also gorgeous recommend"
this top is very pretty but it fits funny its boxy and doesnt hang well i feel like you could almost wear it as a  i tried the small  the small petite they both fit the same too big and too boxy but the petite was shorter i am    i preferred the regular length but if you like your tops to end at your waistband then the petite would fit too i still really like the top so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale
i am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big its meant to be a relaxed fit but it sagged under the armholes because the bust was way too big some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size i got on here to reorder in a smaller size but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days
beautiful summery dress with bright fun print i think this was well worth the sale price i paid it lays nicely and is flattering i went down a size from my normal  to a  however as other reviewers have said the arm holeshalter top is too blousy and no matter how tight i tied it or type of bra i wore you can see bra on the sides im going to get this tailored and then it will be perfect cant wait to wear this on my vacation
"well i just love this dress great material beautiful coloring perfect length true to sizei love the pleated neckline i feel like an old hollywood beauty in this dress great one retailer"
i never ever buy anything full price when it comes to retailer shopping love their stuff but way over priced so i patiently watch and wait this dress though i couldnt do it i had to have it i think it is a fabulous addition to my summer collection and i look forward to wearing it in a few weeks to a july  get away get it while you can
i didnt notice this online but it caught my eye in the store the colors are bright and beautiful i wear a  or ml i tried the  but the bust was too big i wear a  i ordered the size  and it fits perfect im so glad i saw it in the store i think it makes much more of an impact in person than online
i love the color which is eye popping without being gaudy i am    and got size  it goes beautifully on my slightly brown skin the length is just above the knee and the fold of the dress in the front adds that extra touch of oomph it does have wide arm holes so a bra even a strapless one could be tricky although it wasnt a gaping hole for me i think i could wear it over a green bikinilike halter bra and take care of the arm issue
i loved this dress when i saw it mostly for its emerald color i am tan with brown hair and features so green is a good color for me the quality is very high with detailed embroidery and thick fabric the dress comes with a slip which fits well but i dont think youd have to wear based on the opaqueness of the fabric the dress fits true to size but the cut is gracious through the hips this is a relaxed fitting drop waist dress
beautiful in person highly recommend great quality beautiful design flattering
"i am not quite sure what to think about this top color is nice cut iis pretty but the material is denim denimit would probably soften with wear but the deal breaker for me is that i have a vein in my neck that pops out like crazy when i wear the top if i release the neck it goes back to normal not that it is tight but apparently it blocks flow somehow so i passed i tried on regulat  and it was fine at  lbs  dd chest"
this top is adorable in style and fit which is why it breaks my heart that i cant recommend it the embroidery snags so easily when i wore it i ended up with several tears in the threads leaving the pattern a bit of a mess it snagged on my rings my watch and my purse i returned it because of this its really too bad and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn simply because it would last a lot longer
i think the orange top will look great in the fall as well as spring im   and its a great tunic length on me its really pretty and i love it snap it up on sale
i bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic but it was really huge on me i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large it was very long as well and i am  tall i am normally a size  to give you an idea i would recommend it but it is going back for me

the lace detail on this blouse is beautiful i love that it is cotton and it has a detachable camisole which is a nice touch unfortunately this didnt work for me as i found it extremely unflattering the gathered material just doesnt work if you have a large bust it made me look enormous which is never a good feeling i recommend but only for tall slim types with a small bust
this skirt is so cute the fix print is really nice its a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe
"i love how unique this top is especially the buttons that run on the backit is cut boxy but i think it works because there is so much other detail going on the fabric is comfortable and the stitching on the inside is not irritating"
"i tried the  and felt it ran a bit big im   about  and expected to take a  the  was ideallove the concept but thought the material was too stiff to be a swing tank the pleats in the back poke up when you move or bend as if youve got little horns coming out of your back i think a chambray like cloth and stone produces might have rendered this super cute design better imoit has a trapeze shape i wouldnt plan on tucking it infinally you mightnt want to"
"i wound up returning this shirt because i ordered the wrong size so sad i should have sized down im tall and long waisted but slight on top the shirt is gorgeous and the detailing is perfectly done id definitely recommend trying this one just choose your size carefully"
"this shirt feels so special it is mainly t shirt material so i will be dry cleaning to make sure it keepsits shape and delicate feel the stitching is so beautiful ill wear this with jeans and even my navy pencil skirt for work so cute"
absolutely love this top ive been on the lookout for a cute cotton top something thatd be ideal for summertime this beautiful piece doesnt disappoint the color pairing  white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery  looks stunning not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a musthave highly recommend
these are my favorite jeans the fabric is soft but has a good amount of weight to them all the details reflect a high quality jean i usually have a very hard time finding jeans that fit my backside and thighs well without a huge gap at the waist these sit lower on my hips no gap and plenty of space for my butt they do run a bit large though i have a  natural waist and think a  would have been even more perfect
i love this top i got lucky and found it returned at a store always always check the found and collected racks ladies it was a  and i was a little worried it would be much to large but it fit great i like that i can wear something under it or on its own i didnt fit it too short but im a little under  and roughly  lbs  highly recommend
cute skirt and print but high waisted also was more snug so think it runs a tad small i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture but it looks goofy because the waist is so high also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower the models arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her im  so might work better on a taller person sending back
gorgeous color flowy fabric unique design  this top is a winner i dont even mind that ill have to wear a strapless bra with it a little bit on the larger size but not too big in my opinion

love this saw online didnt place the order and when i came back it was gone retailer restocked so i got it second time around ordered the red option this shirt is beautiful sometimes the online photos dont do the piece justice but this time its even better in person the embroidered detail is gorgeous the fabric is light weight and the back of the shirt has button down panels that are almost linenlike in look and feel the fit is just as pictured imo bringing this on vacation with m
a wonderfully heavy weight piece opposed to all the swingy chambray of summer this piece will transition wonderfully into fall the only disadvantage is a relatively high neck which looks lovely but can be a little restrictive at times highly recommend
i am normally an xs or s in tanks so ordered the size  looks pretty much on me as in the pic love that its a cotton denim but it doesnt have any stretch love the look  the fabric but the neck area feels slightly restrictive in the front  i think it wld creep up  pull on me when wearing fabric is slightly stiff  the flared bottom just sticks out armholes do cover the bra  length hits at the top of the hips on me going to return the  but will try the  if the local store has it
really gorgeous print i purchased these to go with the top also recommend it as well and i love these i have a larger behind and its nowadays it seems to find swimsuits with full coverage without feeling like a diaper  these are it there is elastic at the leg openings so that may be uncomfortable for some but i found no problem with it for reference i am usually a   in pants and i purchased a medium
this is such a lovely top but so very big and billowy makes me wish i were taller then i think it could work there is just too much extra fabric all around so sad because it seems well made and is very beautiful too bad it doesnt come in petites or even an xxs even with my hips it was just too much
i love this top usually i prefer neutral colors but i looked at every one of the colors and fell in love with the pink i think it looks the best with the embroidery at the top i too love this cut on my shoulders for summer i would definitely recommend this top i bought an xs and its perfect this shirt made me feel like twirling i love it

these are extremely soft but do run about one size too big with one exception the opening to pull your feet through that bag nicely around your ankles is soooooo small that you have to work to pull the heel of your foot out for me these are dual duty pants casual wear like to the grocery store or coffee shop trip and second as great soft pj bottoms though the ankles are small they do not feel tight at all because the fabric is really that soft they work well with both my sneakers and clas
i loved this dress in the photos and couldnt wait to try it on in person the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it i didnt mind too much but it didnt look like the dress the model is wearing i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my  frame which was a plus i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap not something i would expect from
love the fit and style of this maxi have gotten many compliments however my toddler grabbed the dress when she was falling over and it pulled a bunch of threads out and made the fabric look puckered and worn in that spot for a toddler to do that makes me feel like the quality isnt amazing also the waist part itches me
and the bottom looks like a tutu first i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly second the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt finally the color on the green one is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint back it goes
"given the price i was pretty disappointed by the quality of the fabric the dress falls nicely and fits well but the fabric is cheap i have another maxi dress that i bought for like  bucks at store on the boardwalk and it has the same fit and fabric  i expect a lot more from a dress with this price id recommend only buying on supersale"
i cant get enough of this dress this dress is everything from the flattering fit to the colors and pattern to the design and to the quality this dress really has it all this is worth every penny and in my opinion a great price for a versatile high quality dress the material is that super comfy stretchy material which is perfect for everyday it is a no brainer and easy to throw on im so happy it comes in petite as the xsp length fits me perfect it hits at the perfect length for a
this sweater is stunning it is extremely well made tons of tiny little embellishments that get noticed even by the most discerning eye ive received so many compliments on it if you want it to fit generously or with extra roominess i recommend ordering one size up it fits true to size
ive read the previous reviews about this dress and was hesitant to order it but im so happy i did i can definitely understand why certain reviews are saying that the fabric is cheap it is an extremely thin material as well as a thin lining  however i think it depends on the person because neither of those things actually bother me i get hot very easily so i appreciate the fact that this dress is very thin and flowy  i think its extremely comfortable and looks very cute on  the zipper d

the texture mixed yarn and beading make for a lovely variation on the fairisle as other reviewers have said the length is not as long as it appears in the picture the color is a very dark navy almost black the neck opening is larger than a standard crew sweater but lays mostly flat the overall look is boxy im  and normally wear a medium in retailer sweaters i changed to a large so it would be longer and have a roomy drapy feel
i love this top so much online i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online also this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest it looks nice and drapey on the model when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top thanks to my  looks more like a swing top im sure its a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest
this sweater is absolutely gorgeous the design and structure might make your shoulders look a little bigger but i absolutely love it it has a little boxy shape but i feel like it goes with te style love it get tons of compliments every time i wear it
picked this up in the store today but didnt try it on first it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on there is wonderful detailing but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about  bs to my frame such a shamereally wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l
this dress is just beautiful  color fit length style stretchy fabriceverything about it seems to flatter all body types it also passes the armhole test  no issues there the back closure detail adds a little something special to it i tried it on with black leggings and a black leather jacket just for fun and it looks surprisingly cute for multiseason wear is it overpriced absolutely but so is  of the stuff at retailer i will be keeping it anyway though because i think its a tr
i did like the dress but dont love it i think it would have been better for me if it were snugger the xxs petite was still loose and i found that there are so many dresses with the similar fit i decided to pass i also do like both colors the brown is a better choice for me on my skin tone warmer but both are nice i am  lbs   in waist
love it this suit is high quality and comfortable its a little tricky to get on but once its on its perfect i have a small chest and the fit of the cups and twisted fabric makes me feel totally comfortable i usually wear two pieces in fact this is my first one piece since i was ten and i love it
this is a very pretty top  flowy wo making you look larger a nice blue and a good transition piece but the upper arms are so tight on me id say i have pretty average arms  definitely not super thin but not large either i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it but sadly i just dont think the material will be very forgiving if you have truly thin arms i think it would be a great top maybe sizing up would also work but for me at least i think it

i am not one to complain about things being cut too big as i generally dont mind lose and flowing however this dress is very bell shaped and the fabric is just thick enough that it doesnt really lay well at least not like it does in the photo i bought the earthtone color way and i felt like i was wearing a macrame version of the liberty bell it is also a lot shorter than i was expecting if it werent so short i would try sizing down it is very good quality and the slip is super soft
i ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color looks great with my blonde hair the bell sleeves which are all the rage right now add to the feminine look i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look
i absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit i first saw it on blogger amber fillerupclark barefoot blonde and i knew i had to have it this is the first one piece suit ive purchased in about six years ive avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy and the monokini look just looked odd on me i have a smaller frame and a larger bust  so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge i am a size  but i ordered a size  after reading reviews
first off this runs very large im normally an  and sized down to the  but probably could have done a  it looked like a tent on me the top part is lovely i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now
i got this top in whiterust and it is darling the lining keeps it from being too see through the bell sleeves add style without getting in the way thanks to the shorter length i get many compliments each time i wear it i am   lbs and take xs fit was true to size
this sweet dress is perfect for fall and spring because the knit is not too thick the drape allows layers and the colors are very versatile  the style is loose if you stay tts but will be a slimmer fit if you size down  if your body habitus is super slender definitely size down  the liner slip is soft and the back side of the knit is a bit scratchy  i think this dress is beautiful and best of all forgiving  im happy to have tried both colorsthe problem is picking which one to keep  m
love this dress i wore it with black boots and got so many compliments super comfortable  i feel like this dress will never go out style
i am a huge fan of tracy reese because her dresses are works of art great quality and super wearable for both work and play and this is no exception i purchased this dress in regular xs im    waist  hips and it falls right above my knees for the office or more conservative setting i add a belt and a sweater otherwise i wear it alone for a carefree look i chose the regular size because the dress is voluminous and it gets about an inch shorter when i belt it and it looks
i like this dress the floral pattern and little red beads others may think it is baggy however i like this type of the style
the dress runs large so if you go down a size you will be fine looks awesome on love it would definitely recommend
i ordered a small im usually a petite small i like my tees not fitted i will exchange it for an xs soft it has like the look of a seam down the middle of the back i barely noticed it i think it makes a plain tee shirt a little unique good quality  percent cotton its a white tee soft
"just received my second pair of pilcro legging jeans having bought them last year as well great for work girls night out date night so comfortable with lots of stretch fortunately they hold their shape and dont stretch out they feel like pjs but are nice enough for work my pair from last year have held up well colorwise however some of the leg seam stitching unraveled hence the reason for  stars in quality hopefully these will fare betterregardless i highly recommend"

i tried these on as i needed bottoms to try on some tops and i was wearing a dress but ended up liking them the fit is snug but comfortable they didnt ride up and the denim is supple color is nice too looked really nice with a swing tank that i half tucked i have muscular thighs so shorts are not an easy thing for me anyway recommend tried on   lbs  inch waist
i love these shorts i dont understand why they arent sold out yet they are buttery soft and fit great i usually wear a size  and these are true to size they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even love
ok so this is true to size i recently had a baby i gained a lot of weight am in the process of losing it and took the risk of buying a jumpsuit online i am  with a long torso short legs and a big fat butt so buying pants especially rompers are almost impossible lengthwise this fits me like pants the draping is so flattering and the color combination is splashy but not loud i had to review this as soon as i realized it fit i dont think ive ever been so happy with an retailer pu
i was very excited to find this jumper in a store to try on the small was huge im   the xs was better but perhaps a bit short in the upper body making it feel tightstretched against my shoulders i love the print and style and would have bought it if it was  less however at the current price it needs to fit perfectly which sadly it did not
this is a very nice blouse usually i am size  bought size l and it fits very well would not size up the fit is very forgiving hides tummy i like the vneck fabric does not look like polyester and of good quality the blouse is versatile looks good with skinny dark or white jeans recommend
this is a lightweight sweatergood for the office and summer evenings  here in so cal its a good weight sweater year round  love the lace trim  runs a bit large but not too bad  color is a light cornflower blue not lavender  this works for me but if youre looking for a lavender sweater you might want to think twice
i was surprised when my friend tried this on they dindt have my size in store so she did how uch materil there is on this top it is very beautiful but might be too much on a petite frame the back is almost like a mini train which is pretty ocol in my opinion great colros in person too yes a tiny bit of shimmer 
this top is so pretty in the photos but it just did not work out for me it is more of a pale pink color than offwhite like in the photo and it just hung on me weird i felt like it was true to size but made me feel very boxy i can say it was very well made so maybe im just not the right body type for it for reference im  and  the small fit perfectly but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect but ill sa
i would give this top a  it is a very pretty top i love the embroidery but runs a little short for my taste it still meets past the top of my pants but barely this is why i didnt give this top a  i am  so i think for a petite person the length would be perfect
i like the look and fit of this shirt can be dressed up or more casual i got the purple motif although i also like the brown and think that with all of the black in there on the brown one it would give a dressier look i usually wear small from retailer although this is my first blouse from this brand  ended up getting an xs regular i wanted the sleeves to fit at  as shown in the pics but still be loose i had a ton of extra room in the small and the sleeves hit at wrist bone
i love the look and feel of the material but it was way too short  i dont even have a long torso sadly its going back to the store
this elegant tank made me feel as if i had been transported to downton abbey the velvet trim and the lovely embellishments of sparkle have an art deco delight the swing of the fabric was playful and flattering its easy to dress up and dress down fantastic top
this shirt is much more flattering in person if i hadnt seen it in store i dont think it would have caught my eye i like the mix of casual and dressy this top has i got it specifically for teaching the one thing i noticed however was that the first xs i tried on looked very big on me i tried a second on and the fit was much more flattering i highly recommend that you try on the specific blouse you plan to purchase before you actually buy it im glad i tried a second on because i th

the fabric of these pants isnt like regular denim rather its soft and velvety in texture more like a chino i love the dark saturated olive green the pocket placement is very flattering on the rear normally i wear a size  in premium denim and size  in paige jimmy jimmy jeans however in this particular pair i needed a size  i definitely recommend sizing down
this tee is a great everyday staple  it is comfortable and it also drapes very well  i am     and i got this in xxs regular  the length is perfect for leggingsskinny jeans and it also looks really cute with a side knot in front i have this is navy green and black  the navy color is brighter in person and in my opinion looks better  you cant go wrong planning on getting the grey and pink one as well
i feel like a pessimist but then again nothings perfect the only thing wrong with this stunning sweater is no button or snap so it just bags open love it tho
this sweater is beautiful it fitsdrapes nicely is a gorgeous color feels soft and is comfortable to wear im generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium the sleeves are pretty longi have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand but thats all rightthey look fine rolled i highly recommend
i wanted to love this top its gorgeous wthe beading and velvet however it really goes with nothing im tall and slender the top felt a bit cropped when i tried it on very wide flare shape but that wouldnt make me return it what is making me send it back is the color the grey is gorgeous but the fabric is a buttery yellow color i think i was picturing it more cream i dont know what in the world you could wear this with grey pants a grey pencil skirt it looks terrible
"im one of those people who is juuuust right between being regular and petite sized so i have a hard time with some longer tunic styles this tee is pretty fitted though the shoulders and bust which makes the rest of the top kind of skim over the body i like that especially for those days where i feel a little bloated or like i want to hide out a bit the fabric is very comfortable and not sheer the little stripe down the back is a cute detail and its in a slightly contrasting fabric w"
this shirt fit really really big i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l if not a medium sadly its going back  otherwise its high quality and a beautiful design
"i had a feeling this might not work for me so i decided to try it on in the store just to verify i was quite right im a tall gal with a size  and it just billowed out and made me look wider i normally wear a size m in tops and even this was a tad looseif youre petitesmaller framed this will probably work for you if youre tall and busty this doesnt do us gals any favors in my opinionit is a lovely top and i loved the velvet trim at the bottom the inner lining was decent"
cant wait to wear this out for the holidays very comfortable and versatile  looks great with the vegan leather moto pilcro pants or any black skinny jeans for a more dressed up look  i was originally going to pair with dark gray pilcro but the black moto with black heels looked really great in the store dressing room beading is gorgeous and well done velvet trim makes it luxe in my opinion love that you dont need to pile on anything else to look polished  top speaks volumes in and of

"i recommend this product but with the following reservations the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit i love the fit and make of the jumper but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day this is still happening after several washes which makes me feel disappointed it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely"

this is a cute dress but not for me  i think it runs very small  it is super textured so if you dont want to add bulk aka pounds to your frame this probably isnt for you its too bad its online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first im sure its probably adorable on smaller thinner people unfortunately mine is going back

i needed an outfit for my sons christening  weeks after he was born one thing i have to keep in mind with purchasing items now is how well they work for easy breastfeeding this jumpsuit was perfect dressed up with a cropped tuxedo jacket cute shoes and jewelry i felt so chic and not only did it fit my new postbaby shape but was awesome for nursing him when needed i felt comfortable all day and look forward to dressing it down for less formal occasions the material is so soft and i
looks cute on not super form fitting more of a flow fit love the detailed stitching so cute floral pattern is fun not too busy i loved the pockets there is a bit of extra material but if you expect a flowy fit its still totally lovely i was worried about tightness in the arms but not a problem at all i love this dress lining makes it feel really well made
i have long arms and they are not really small and the small fit me well i think the fact that i have broad shoulders made this top work for me definitely a keeper i am surprised that the arms fit me though because i often experience sleeves that are too tight when trying on tops im glad that wasnt the case this time around im   depending on my appetite
"these socks feel amazingi have them in both colorsyou would be surprised at the softness of these socks yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me i feel like these would last a long time with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spathese socks are softthese socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li"

the medium fits perfectly its not too long or too short the feel of the fabric is soft and not heavy at all i love the detail in the bird too it bright and colorful overall a great buy
i ordered the cream colored duster after purchasing the grey one in store i loved the grey one so much i had to get the other color i love the length of the item i am  and dont feel like it is too short for me to get the look it is light weight so i did not get too warm in it and will be able to wear it much of the year i did wear it open as i feel that it runs a tad tight on the arms and torso when buttoned however i prefer the look of it worn open so that was not a problem for me

its like a coat for your legs and lined with some silky fabric the only flaw is a slight bulkiness where the fly hooks up  i am a little sad that they dont have a petites because i think this is proportioned for women  and over and i am only  also not recommended for anyone with a tummy pooch so tall women with somewhat flat abs  snap it up its a fabulous look for you
great dress  fitted but flowing  i like the colors and think it will easily grams iron to fall  i am  ft  d  waist
bought this in cream in my usual     it is a very flattering summer weight cardi which will work well with jeans and maxi dresses this summer i would point out however that the sleeves are very snug  if you dont have thin arms then you may have to consider sizing up i stuck with the xs even though i had to carefully pull the arms on because the s was just a little looser in the back the sleeves are meant to be form fitting but i think they have been designed a little
the colors of this dress really caught my eye i was hesitant to try it in the store because they only had a size  and im normally a size  when i tried it on i was pleasantly surprised that the dress fit around my hips success but like the other women that commented there was something funky going on in the midriff area the dress didnt accentuate my curves the stylist was available at the store i was at so she recommended that i belt it to add that extra umph the belt definitely di
i bought this in both the navy a more saturated blue in person  gorgeous and green but both are going back it fit everywhere but in the upper arms even across my chest and i usually encounter the opposite i think it might just be the way its cut across the shoulders that dont allow for much movement so while beautiful and so incredibly soft it has to go back if you have slender arms i think it would be a great fit

i bought this dress to wear to work in my second trimester the shape is perfect to accommodate a baby bump while still flattering the top definitely recommend for any pregnant women trying to avoid true maternity clothes
the cut of this piece is great the quality of the fabric is terrible i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length so much that i can no longer even wear it i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces this didnt hold up to one wearing let alone one season i recommend strongly against it
the design is very cute im glad i listened to reviews bc this blouse definitely runs at least  sizes small maybe  i bought the blue and its more of a navy blue instead of royal blue at the sale price and additional  off my daughter is an employee i didnt mind paying  
i was eyeing this one for a while based on the style and other reviews i did order one size up i think it would have been too small  in my regular size i do wish it was a little longer too the back is fine because its longer its definitely wearable though i wouldnt recommend it for a work function if youre a bit taller despite all of that i really do like dress its a new favorite i ordered the blue  love the dot pattern i wore it with brown booties and it

"this is a beautiful dress but the fit was strange i have a small waist and larger hips i generally wear a  in a fit  flare style but styles like this i generally wear a  for my hips even in a  this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top halfi really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips it really is pretty"
i purchased this dress in the green and while the print and material were lovely the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top the billowly bottom made it look like a bag i am   and  waist and the size  fit which makes me think this runs large ill be returning this dress
do not buy i used my  discount on this what a waste my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand i should have gotten a small i dont think that wouldve helped it was so awkward looking nothing like the model it made me look as if i had gained  pounds it was waaay longer in the backlike a mullet the material was really thick it is more appropriate for fall i had high hopes for thisto dress up or down it was just so ridiculous
"i think this is adorable and am so excited to have bought it it is really flattering i love how it hangs its loose enough without being unflattering at all its a little retro it feels really soft i hope it holds up well im  and and  i got an xs and it fits perfectly"
beautiful white denim pants the fit is perfect fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom very classy and versatile cut paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception will be getting them hemmed but i dont mind because they are perfect
i hoped from the picture that this would be more of a straight down sort of fit retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them however the top had too much of a flare out bellshaped vibe i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer but this top would be too sacklike and billowy with those i think it would only work with jeanstrousers my final objection was the arm holes  the way they are cut
really enjoy this pullovers arm detail i got the purple which was somewhere between aubergine and garnet i think this will easily go with black pants to wear to work or a fun skirtjeans
"pros fits tts i tried on a size m and it fit well for my  and hourglass frame the cowl neck gives it a nice touch of class love the pop of yellow not too showy and yet cute and fun fabric has a great feel and stretch to it forgiving fit  will go with many outfitswore a nude bra and had no seethrough issuescons does seem a tad delicate easy to snag due to being a knit but otherwise solid construction unlinedrea"
i love these i adore tracy reese and these are my favorites they feel like pjs fit true to size and are just perfect for work im a teacher or for going casual very lightweight and not too hot for texas summers
first things first these are not black and white as the photos suggest they are beige and black which was a disappointment when they arrived i can still wear white shirts with them but had they actually been bw i think theyd be more versatile in terms of possible shirt colors that said they are wellmade and the waistband and pocket detailing is nicely done i love loosefitting rayon pants and these are just that mine fit a little looser than the models fit i ordered a small and

"this top has a lot of potential comfortable easy to wear but its cut too small in the area above the bust i tried the top in small medium and large i usually wear s or m in retailer tops and couldnt get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling you can see it on the model too  that space right above the bra near the armhole i think youd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom i tried the green in the sto"
i love this top it fits perfect and is of great quality i ordered the pink and love it so much im getting the navy one colors are so trendy as well this top is so much cuter in person hard to tell the detail online definitely recommend to others
i saw this dress in a store the other day it is so cute in real life i dont think the pictures online even begin to show how cute it is on the dress is wellmade and it fit perfectly in fact it is quite flattering i am so happy i saw it in the store even though i am big online shopper i would have passed on this dress if i only saw it online but dont because it is worth every penny
fit is just like stet in my opinion
i have been stalking these pants since they first showed up on retailers site i have never even tried on anything like this before though so have been waiting patiently for a review to get an idea of what they might look like fit likeetc sale plus  off was incentive to take the plunge without a review though i am wearing them right now and they are so comfortable and pretty and justeverything summer perfect i am not a shorts person generally wear skirts and dresses these are
i cannot speak more highly of these jeans i am a standard size   and have never been able to purchase a pair of jeans and wear them right away i always have to hem them by massive amounts these jeans are so flattering the wash is amazing i have worn them with cute ballet flats and tall boots so far but i think the possibilities are endless i am petite but in a curvy way and i havent felt these great in a pair of jeans in so long the wash is great for dress updress down i have
this is a super cute top that is a fit and flare design i think the stylists wanted it to look more straight hence the odd model shots but this definitely has a flare to it it also has pockets it feels a bit artsy to me which isnt normally my style but the pink and white is just very feminine and pretty i would say it probably runs a little large because of the style but i have larger arms so the arms were a bit snug in my normal size but i didnt want to go up in size as the rest fit
the stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint  the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model  it also has pockets which is a bonus to me  i normally wear a  but bought a  in this dress  i am a  and i felt the  was a little tight across the chest  otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size
this is really a gorgeous blouse the design is very feminine and elegant and fits true to size i didnt think it ran short and the material is light and airy it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a  when it was available for a quick second it was def worth the wait a gorgeous top
this dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away i am a size  petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit if anything i might have to size down i purchased a  petite in this dress and i couldnt zip it all the way up it was as if i was trying to get into a  petite  i dont even think a size  would fit there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received even if the fit was perfect i didnt
this is just the cutest dress on i love the way the plaid comes together in the seams and the fullness of the skirt i almost didnt order it but then i left something in my cart too long and it was gone this was my next choice i havent had the chance to wear it yet but the wrinkles pressed out beautifully and it is hanging in my closet waiting for an event i will wear it without a bra since even with my strapless the bra shows in the front i think if you want to wear a bra it would be
love the luxury feel so soft perfect for day out im  and the fit is just right not too long or short dalls right at the shoulders too
this bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like im not wearing a bra at all except i have the gentle support i need the material is very thin and the pink color is see through so not recommended under a white or see through shirt perfect for sleeping or lounging in
i loved this dress immediately it is soft to the touch and super comfortable i will be wearing this so much this summer the arms are true to size and the body is flowy and roomy but it is still flattering highly recommend
i agree with another reviewer who said to get these while you can the fish print is adorable and you cant beat the style and uniqueness for this price i am   lbs with long legs and a thicker waist normally wear size  in pants and purchased these in size small i would definitely recommend sizing down the mediums fit me ok but the small was more flattering overall while still being roomy and having lots of flow cant wait to wear these
this dress fit me like a glove and its very pretty on but the fabric looks and feels very cheap in person it didnt look like a dress i spent this much money on the lining is a very silky thick polyester that doesnt seem like it would be comfortable in any sort of heat the lace overlay has this strange fusing kind of material between the pattern that looks so cheap i love the idea of this dress but it just isnt worth the money in my opinion so i returned it

i love this jess i got it in the blue gray color and i think its going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft im thinking that im going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well
since these are high waist pants i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit im   lbs and ordered a size  but it was much too large i love the style of these pants a lot they look great if you have long legs the size  ran about  above my ankle higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great
this sweater is very comfortable and soft unlike other reviewer i did not find the lace to be itchy im  usually size  decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted its easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy not sure how its going to handle the wash
i bought this in a medium at the store usually a size   and bought one for my daughter who was with me in the coral color shes  months pregnant  and bought her a small it fits fine below the belly she loves how comfy it is my other daughter saw them and i had to buy her a pair as well  so we were hanging out at the hotel on a girls weekend and wore them at the pool and even to sleep in i think you can actually dress it up and wear it out and about as well i did see that a
its navy and redthe photo looked black to me so i couldnt use with black skirt that i had planned to pair it with but its cute with jeans and maybe white shorts next summer the front gapes open when you sit down so ill either have to pin it or sew a snap there unless i want the world to see my bra also a little short waited for meim  so i wish the wrap hit a little lower but not enough that i didnt keep it it is flattering blouse the shoulder ties add a little extra flair
so cute great for over a swim suit or walking around town got these on sale xxs fit perfectly fabric is very soft pom poms add fun styling
this product is the best if not the most excellent garment i have purchased in years i feel like a model even though i am full body lady what gorgeous piece of clothing
"im still on the fence about these i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker they just feel too flimsy and too much like im ready for bed i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasnt wearing pjs i just cant get past that they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer loungeweari ordered the small which fit fine i wear  in retailer pants i got the p"
the front and back of this square sweater are the same and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like its on backwardsthe lace would be nice but its itchy and the sweater is cropped so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body the  sleeves make it look small and fitted but the body shape is bulky just couldnt get it to work
these are not only comfortable but so cute they are something you dont see on everyone else and people always comment i get so many compliments or inquiries every time i have them on the materiel is lightweight and flowing i love these casual beautiful beach pants i got a small my usual size and they fit great   lbs i wear tee shirts bathing tops coobies any kind of top looks swell get them while you can i got the peach and black color
the fabric is very thin i have seen this comment on several sundry reviews but its hard to imagine how thin the fabric is until you see it in person i could put a cami under it  but it was also rather short on me i dont usually have trouble with shirts running short and can even sometimes wear petite sizes since i am only 
i just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length i got a small and i am  the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me i love the soft material and could live in this dress such a great staple for my closet
this was an impulse purchase for me a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring this one did the trick i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day the jumpsuit is l
this is not your basic white tee the ruffle and seam down the front add visual interest cute alone or paired with a sweater and statement necklace
i was looking for a dressy shirt i could wear more than a few times i have a reunion tomorrow that i wanted to wear this to i went into a store and saw this i immediately thought this was the perfect shirt i saw the price tag and decided not to get it i looked several other places and i kept coming back to this shirt i think if it wasnt displayed in the store i wouldnt have wanted it so much it is so much more beautiful in real life the photo doesnt do it justice i ended up orderin
im a big fan of left of center as a brand and this top is definitely a winner  the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tentlike highly recommend
i bought this vest to add more versatility to my wardrobe i love it i got it in navy and since it is one color it goes with a lot of different things  tanks long sleeves short sleeves pantsskirts etc i like the bow in the back and the vest makes a plain outfit look much more elegant and exciting the vest itself is a little longer than i would have liked
makes me feel like a sexy ice skater true to size i am  and  lb and both the small and medium fit i kept the medium love it
i loved the look of this tunic it is made well and very pretty it was so big and heavy i had to return it i think the small in this would be too big
absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding it is so well made and luxurious i feel amazing in it even more gorgeous in person
i think of tracy reese as running small and usually size up but the  was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage so you need the right bra
i give this sweater a five star review i am always thrilled to be able to add a cardigan or caccoon sweater that is a color that is different than black or whitethis pairs beautifully with so many of the shells and sleeveless shirts that i have from retaileryes this sweater is extremely delicate it didnt pull at all while i was trying it on this will be a great transition sweater
i ordered size medium the fit is true to size the color and pattern work beautifully with the delicate yarns and design of this sweater as other reviewers have stated it is very thin and lightweight in my opinion it serves more as an accessory rather than it being functional as a cardigan worn for warmth when i tried it on i considered whether it would provide any warmth at allsummertime air conditioning etc the answer is no if i decide to keep it it will be for its aesthetic
the fit is a bit loose in the body more than you can tell on the model  more like a true swing style top i feel the arms are a good fit but i ordered one size up from my normal since im planning to wear this as a maternity top arms are definitely a size smaller than the body the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd but overall i still like it the cutout notch at the collar is super cute plus the green color of this top is lovely and i love that its made in the usa so ill be keeping
a must have sweater with great details it can be a star piece with leather tights or very long flare jeans i recommend platform booties for perfect body proportion
this product is awesome im a tall lady with wide calves and thighs and these socks look and feel fantastic on me they are tight enough that they dont wind up sliding down around my ankles but not so snug that they make my legs look like sausages i would recommend this product to all of my girlfriends

this dress did end up working out for me however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a medlrg chest andor broad shoulders the fabric is light weight nice for summer it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be drapey i kept it
i love the idea of this top  i had reservations when i ordered it dt the large armholes but i envisioned wearing my cute cropped pilcro jean jacket with it  it turned out to be a disappointment  the armholes are gigantic and the sweater itself did not fit as on the model  the front was much shorter and wider and basically stuck out from my body  for reference i ordered the xxsp  sizing up might have lengthened the front but would have exacerbated the armhole problem
this is a beautiful lined jacket with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono it hit me at the high hip not low hip as shown on the model given how structured it is i dont think the one size will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit
im sad i was unable to get an xs as the small is somewhat big on my   frame im keeping it for the sale price though when i put it on in the store i got so many compliments from other customers who went to find it i think it is meant to run large and honestly i still think even with it looking big it still looked better in person than the model i would recommend ordering it if you can and dont mind pieces that drape like this

this is adorable and unique ive tried shawls and ponchos before they usually swallow me up this sweater has that type of feel but isnt so much fabric goes with everything
this is such a great top  it can be easily dressed up or down i love my tops flowy and this is just that i have a larger chest  and the flowy nature of it keeps it from being too short up front even though it has eyelits in it it can be worn without a cami underneath as long as you wear a good nude bra itll be a great sweater for all seasons im even able to wear it to work highly highly recommend
i thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncholike design but the sleeves were a bit short on me and i thought it was a little pricy i decided against it for those reasons but if you dont mind those things then you might like it its definitely worth the try
the look quality and feel of this jacket is perfect it does run a large so i would order a size down i definitely worth every penny
this dress has a unique watercolorlike pattern and design and is silk but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip the side slits come up high almost to the hip i am  and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i dont wear a belt if i belt it the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo
i was on the fence about this dress because even on the model its a little bit frumpy but it was so pretty that i tried it however on my short frame its even frumpier the quality is very good the fabric is soft and its lined the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin i am   lbs with largeish hips and i ordered a  but even the petite was too saggy i needed a
i tried the bw one in the store liked the look and feel of it fabric is soft and comfortable for reference im  and  lbs this dress runs large size  was too big on me  armhole waist length etc im ordering  online hoping it will fit better not a huge fan of the black belt otherwise very happy with the dress
i sized down in this dress from a  to a   the  was too blousy in the bust and it did feel sacklike i sized down and suddenly it looked greatfitted enough through the bust and hips be warnedthis dress has to be pulled over your head the fit in the bust will determine a lot i am tallalmost   and the length was greatsimilar to the model in the photo the cream and black print is gorgeous
"i just bought this dress yesterday in the store and love it im    and purchased the  which fits perfectlyits made of a cool material and is lined which adds to the quality of the dress i love the neutral print and the square vneck makes it a little different than just an average dress this dress can be dressed up or down depending on accessories it also makes a great work dress if you add a little cardigan or blazer very versatile and a great buy especially a the s"
this dress looks better in person the shape is pretty much straight but fits nicely even if you are curvier it doesnt show your imperfections the type blue and white color is nice but a bit see through on the bottom and the slip is a little short came to about mid thigh for me so i would wear leggings underneath i dont think a belt would look good with this because of the shape and if you have curves very cool summer style
im fussy about robes im fairly small size  or  and a lot of robes swamp me in the smaller size this robe fit well and was flattering the material is soft but absorbent the pattern is lovely and feminine without being dowdy the wrap is generousi wear this robe just out of the shower and dont feel exposed
i love the cut of this dress and im rather short i dont think you need to be tall its a nice light fabric that will work well for warm weather it did wrinkle quite a bit during the day but never looked messy i certainly wouldnt describe it as frumpy it has a nice loose  feel and you can tighten the belt to make it more fitted through the waist the belt is sewn on in the back so you cant take it off without quite a bit of tailoring i had no trouble with the bust being too

love this dress  wear it with sneakers or boots  can add a belt or the right accessories to dress it up
in the online picture this lightweight sweatshirt looked so inviting that i decided to order it when it arrived i could not believe how soft and comfortable it felt it was equally comfortable on the rayon tencel and cotton content of the fabric created such a comfy feel that this top is sure to be a favorite for a relaxing weekend or evening i ordered the size  even though i usually order a small in most tops this one seems to lend itself to the oversized look and i was right about t
the color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than id imagined from the photos it has a quilted quality so doesnt drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms i typically wear a size  and ordered the large i think a medium might have been better havent decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return has an artsy cool professor vibe that i like

my personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top the material of the fabric doesnt seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me i wanted to love this top but i did not
"overall the dress is beautiful easy and great quality but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo if that makes sense its not poofy or superlayered but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straightshift shape that you see online here besides that bottom part the fit is true to size but as a petit the extra fabric isnt what im looking fori think it works depending on what youre looking for beautiful though"
"oh this skirt is gorgeous but i feel it runs small in the waistim sending it back and ordered up im happy i did as today its sold outbeautiful and vibrant colors very well made just wish some of the retailer sizes wouldnt run on the smaller side"
ive been wearing these shorts for years i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length the fabric quality on these shorts and many many other retailer items has gone down sure theyre great when you try them on in the storesoft comfortable flattering but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on i wore these several times sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall and a
this coat is fun flirty  flattering i bought it strictly for how good it looks on  its not a coat for warmth the top is tailored and fitted but the bottom is very full and swings there is a lot of fabric on the bottom im not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves  i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me however i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it so keep that in mind the small fit me perfect v
i had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady i have no idea what im going to do when the time comes to wash it though well cross that road when we come to it i guess also  the interior seams are a bright electric blue 
love the way this dress looks online sadly it doesnt look great on me im  athletic build the small fit perfectly but the extra fabric in the hippocket area just seemed to drag me down i really wished this worked for me but i think youve gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off
this trench is beautiful with a lovely swinging skirt that adds a romantic sense of drama and movement  youll feel as though you are starring in your very own film noir movie i wish i could have kept it but i couldnt justify paying full price on a coat that had to be handwashed the label specifies no dry cleaningthere is a lot of fabric on this trench and i imagine that all those little pleats will have to be ironed too i dont have the time for that and for this much money i wou
i love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric its light soft and crisp which is perfect for summer days the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso the waste line is a bit high for me but overall it didnt feel weird or look funny there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with once i tried it on i had to bring it home with me
the cut and color of the dress is awesome however the biggest flaw is the zipper i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper brokesad day especially at the price there also were a number of loose threads i recommend waiting until it goes on sale youll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper
this sweet little number in the mustard yellow has become my fall and winter goto sweater so easy to wear understated and a bit retro looks great tucked into skirts or highwaisted jeans or out and the subtle shift in textures is a nice detail highly recommend and a great price point
this shirt is adorable love the lace detail on the sides but way too boxy for me its a great lighter weight for spring but it doesnt feel flimsy sadly there isnt any shape to help make this flattering it will be returned
shorts dont fit me like they did the first time and ive only worn them twice the material isnt what is use to be it stretches out to fast i dont think i will be buying these again wish i could take them back
very pretty skirt makes me feel very feminine and makes my waist look smaller than it is
im   and tried on pxs ps and xs the portions on the petite are perfect for petite sizes however if you are a d cup keep in mind that you cannot wear anything thick underneath it if you go with the fitted size the sleeves are pretty slim in the petite xs too im keeping the pxs skirted trench because it looks like a dress from the fifties fitted and flared and looks so cute unbuttoned like on the model also unlike some trenches there are minimum details like epaulets contra
"cant say enough about the style of this trench the material is soft and the shape is amazing for all body types the color is great and theres some pretty aqua colored piping in the inside of the coatthe sizing is a little hmmm i ordered a large im usually a  on top or a large mostly to accommodate a larger chest ddd i think proportion wise im more a medium through the shoulders and in length so sometimes i can size down to a medium or large petite depending on the shapewith"
"so a bit of a bone to pick with retailer i am normally a petite xs  chest however the petite sizing was not available online so i ordered a regular xs thinking i could always have it altered i could barely button across the chest huh when i went to return it at the store i noticed they had xs petite on the rack so decided to try it it fits perfect  like how it should i can button fine across the chest and there is a little extra roomi have no idea why the sizing is so off between"

this dress looks better when wearing i am  regular size s or  cup  d and fits perfect length and width in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length  but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily i wish the slip is the same length as the dress i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric i hope it helps
i love this dress because it is everything i have been looking for it is flattering because of the details and it gives the illusion of an hourglass figure if you dont have one i love that it has sleeves because sometimes i just dont feel like finding a shawl or bolero or whatever in case i get suddenly anxious about my arms the green is dark and shimmering almost like lace over jewel tone emerald love

   i saw this dress online and thought it was beautiful but considered not buying it because of other comments that the bust was too small for women with more curves fortunately the lovely blue dress was in my local retailer store and i decided to try it on in a size  i think the dress fits perfectly and i have gotten many compliments including from random strangers i have had no problem with a tight zipper or a low back which is perfectly able to cover my bra in the back th

i feel in love with the dress when i saw it hanging at the store usually i feel bailey  dresses make my body look really round and short ive passed up a few because i didnt find them too flattering i almost even just passed this one up because of my past experiences but i tried it on and felt like i had the body of another person it hugged my body very nicely and i felt like it gave me a shape i also saw all the possibilities it had the store had it styled with a denim jacket i can

"in the photo this looks like a heavy knit top but its not the fabric is very light thin and soft its like a knit nightgown material i said this runs big b ecause im normally a size xl and i can wear this it actually fits me a little less flowy than on the model and i think looks better so to me you can size down if you want this not to have so much flowing fabricthe front crisscrosses over and it will stay together at the top area with movement the two fabric pieces sort of"
this dress is so short i double checked to make sure i didnt get a petite by mistake  im  and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck it fit well on top but  you could see my underwear in the front seriously i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didnt work out
i bough this dress in blue and i cannot tell you the compliments and the looks i get on the street no kidding this is a beautiful dress which has a very feminineromantic quality to it i bought size  and it sits perfectly on my waist i completely fell in love with that dress and especially with the lace work and the design this is a classic piece that is always going to be timeless in my opinion no regret at all to have bought it
this cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops im surprised it isnt one size fits all bc it is very generous in the xss which i got and im a  i can see wearing this all year long even summer cool nights very classic style the picture on website looks frumpy to me but on it is very flattering
i am a short frame with broad shoulders and a large chest which means peplum tops typically look horribly unflattering on my frame not this top the cut is very flattering due to the lower peplum not too much fabric to add to the waistline truly a perfect fit if this top came in any other colors i would buy them all
i love everything about this sweater it is very well made beautiful material and such an effortless way to pull it all together it runs large which was unfortunate for me as i bought the xs petite and i really need xxs in this one but none are left i am  ft tall and weigh about  pounds i can wear a  but not in this sweater it runs very well and i highly recommend it hope they make more in this style it is so fresh looking and so comfortable
i love the look and feel of these shorts  typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that theyre practically made of nothing but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric however they run very large being  lbs and about  i typically buy size  or xs but these looked a bit ridiculous on me with how big they are i tried shrinking them in the wash since theyre  cotton and that helped some along with getting rid of the creases from shipping
this is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors it is formfitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions  i plan to wear it for my sons graduation but i think there are many potential uses for this dress be aware that like many byron lars sheath dresses the bottom part is very tight makes it hard to fit for more pearshaped people the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t
i always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints i think its a lot of fun not so fun to put on but its worth the trouble i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself i also own the mona dress in  but i had to size down to a  for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much

bypassed this blouse online but its striking colors caught my eye at the store bought the olive green color and its gorgeous the color is great for both spring and fall im normally a petite xs at  feet and  pounds the regular xs is a great fit for me not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist material is lighweight and flowey dont hesitate to buy its a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans
this swing tee is amazing i bought the blue one and the color is true to what it looks like online the material is so soft and cozy i am typically an xs and bought an xs however it runs ever so slightly big if i had purchased the xxs it seems like the arms would have been to tight and im definitely not a fan of that whatever the case i highly recommend this tshirt and love its versatility and that i can wear this all year long
this blouse is quite stiff i wouldnt mind the boxiness if this blouse werent so long even if you size down because of the eyelet and the cute hem it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit
this is the second top i have purchased in this design the first being in the navy blue color i loved the effortless swing of this shirt and the comfortable cotton texture that i chose to purchase it in wine and have since received many compliments on both the shape and color this is an easy top for me to put on and feel good within
if youre pregnant congratulations this shirt is for you if youve ever dreamed of being an xxs this shirt is also for you im a  normally a small or medium but often size down to xs in swing tops the xs is ginormous on me although it fits through the shoulders i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides its that wide think flying squirrel what doesnt show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve which makes it look wide at the to

i love the contemporary style of this piece but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me  but if you dont mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms it might work for you the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces
beautiful dress when you look at it on the hanger you think this could be really good or really bad but it is absolutely beautiful would highly recommend it  can dress it up or down

i like this dress because its the perfect shape on me and i think the design is modern and cute i got the red and i really like the pattern and the subtle tulle edging the material is a little stretchy and substantial and theres also a lining i wore it with little booties like the model and tights and a cropped moto jacket and loved the outfit i am short small chest but somewhat broad shouldered the empire waist would not work on larger chested women with hourglass figures
i have been continually disappointed in retailers clothing for the past year i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained soso but dresses like these somehow make the cut it does not make sense since when did retailer exclusively market to older women no retailers market has always been young adults this dress is extremely matronly although the bottom print is nice the hot pink belt is completely mismatched and gaudy i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
i tried these on when they were full price and waited for them to go on sale and was very excited when they did im not the type to buy leather pants but these look like i can dress them up or down and dress them like jeans im a size  in pants but i bought size  i highly recommend
"i usually find maeve to run tts but i sized down in this i am normally a  and got an xs regular to make the length more workappropriate i think a larger size emphasized the extra room at the front tucks  making it look a little maternitylikeit is very flattering on  drapes nicely i got the cranberry color for the holidays and will wear in with wine tights and light taupe over the knee suede boots"
the photos do not do this dress justice i loved it as soon as i tried it on it is good quality and the fabric is not too thin definitely recommend

very comfortable dress and cool for our hot summers i ordered in my normal size medium neckline is cut a little low but not enough to change my mind on the purchase
like the idea of this longer teetunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size  small fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits unflattering how the slits hit me maybe for some one taller  i am 
i bought this dress tonight and i love it the fit is perfect and the color is perfect the dress runs true to size as all dolan products do i ill wear this dress to an interview with tall heel boots love this dress and think everyone should give it a try
im loving these even if they are a wee bit tight im   lbs and they hit well above my ankle as in the photo ordered a  i vacillate between a  and  and am finding a little muffin top spillage even after wearing a couple of times the good news these babies stay pretty well exactly as they come  as opposed to stretching out a ton the denim is durable and stretchy and i would totally recommend them
bought this in navy in the spring and this fall in green i am  and  with very long legs and they are too short to be work appropriate as a dress at least for me i wear both with leggings short boots and a variety of jackets and love them they feel like butter against the skin and are incredible comfortable recommend for reference im about  and an athleticstraight build and bought m in the blue and l in the green go figure

as tshirts go this one has a flattering fitshapely waist yet not so tight that unwanted curves show i bought the striped one in my usual medium and it fits perfect now so will have to be careful when washing if it were available i would have tried the large so if youre a tad senitive about tight clothes i suggest upsizing its a nice weight fabric and the details around the v neck are greatthe v dips just like the photo  approprialty sexy and age appropriate im   at 
i love this tee it has a very flattering fit and the fabric is very soft it runs small especially in the arms i suggest sizing up the tee looks great on it is slimming and super comfortable
i love this simple but stylish t shirt  the fabric is soft and it fits true to size and i knew i would love it even before it was delivered i recommend it
"this is such a lovely dress  and it looks great on like other customers i like the petal hem and the top part which is stretchy is soft and not clingy i think the only drawback is that the color isnt as rich a green as it looks in the pic ive attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposesill be wearing this way into the fall"
i love the color combo look and feel to this dress   and the xs fits as pictured
it is the cutest detailed little white top i recommend this because you can wear it anywhere and dress it up with a scarf
this dress is just as it looks in the pictures shapeless the trick is to add some styling to it add the pilcro dark denim jacket and the headwaters scarf and your all set i had on black seychelle loafers but would pair it with a black dorsay flat the top blue of the dress is a faded sun washed looking navy and it goes well with the black of the skirt i usually wear a  in dresses and the xs in this dress fit well im    this is going to be a nice winter to spring dre

everything about this dress is perfectthe material style and fit flattering and comfortable im  and the length was just above the knee you can dress it up or down comfortable i definitely recommend
i ordered this dress in a  which is my usual size and it was tight around the waist and across the back i am   small chest but broader shoulders and back and curvy butt this dress is beautiful quality and well made but was too snug it was very long to the point where i would only be able to wear heels the belt is cheap looking i would recommend replacing it with something nicer the waist drops slightly below the natural waist and the top puckers over it in the front and back
i am petite but chesty and this dress is flattering it is a loose fit but not tight across the bust line i tried it on with nude shoes and it dresses it up i ended up buying this dress in a regular cut s because i wanted it to not be so short which made it look more like a casual dress to wear with the ocean behind you i think it is a perfect day dress to go anywhere and by changing your shoes or adding a thin sweater or short jacket you can go out to dinner or theatre the picture is a tr
my favorite new dress i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric its very flattering and easy to wear
i was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy  wide and wrinkled looking the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop i got it today and its fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pearshaped i dont normally like that but being thin helps the best part of the top is the
i completely disagree with the previous review i purchased this dress and i absolutely love it i went out for a couple occasions one being special and the other not so special and both times i received compliments all night my husband loves it and that really says a lot i feel the dress runs true to size and the quality is right where it should be runway worthy absolutely worth   probably not but i personally cant afford that anyway im so happy to have found th
this dress looks nothing like the photo the sequins are dull no sheen at all the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap shiny plastic i didnt even try it on because it was so hideous when i pulled it out of the box not remotely worth the price and wouldnt buy it on sale for  either skip
i was very impressed with the quality of the satin this top can easily be dressed up or down i purchased the white and love it the almost full zip back makes for easy on and off i ordered a medium and think it runs a little big
perfect for the change in weather this sweater is very thick and a tad big i would say it is true to size but if youre like me and usually order up in sweaters and outerwear dont there is ample room for layering underneath without being too cumbersome the color is a bit different than that shown it is more of a blush heather with light gray threads intertwined just a note the pin does not come with the sweater the closeup made me think it did but it really doesnt matter the color
this vest is beautiful and exactly as shown in the model shot it is soft warm and drapes beautifullyperfect length on my  frame the leather detail along the edge is a nice highquality touch i will say that it is pretty itchy especially around the neck but wearing a shirt with a collar like it is shown seems to help that issue the dark color is navy in the print not blackoverall i think this is gorgeous but the full price feels a little ludicrousi think i may wait until sa

i just got this skirt in the mail and im absolutely delighted with it id ordered both my normal size and one size up taking a tip from the reviewer whod found it snug but my usual retailer size fit beautifully i do have narrow hips though so maybe its snug on more curvaceous figures the fabric is so soft and supple and ive already tried the skirt with several widely varying shoe styles so i can confirm its versatility it looks feminine with heeled sandals as in the pictur
im happy i bought this top its very cute and almost a little immaturechildish but with the right bottoms it looks classy i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up it washes beautifully will probably not work on large chested women
this top runs a bit small but its very pretty i got the ivory and its beautiful very form fitting it is a bit see thru so i will probably wear a tank under it its simple tshirt material so i feel like it should be a bit less 
i think these are a cute pant they run large in the waistseat area but not in the length im  and this gathered at my ankle i like them even though i have to keep hoisting them up keep in mind the tie to tighten the waist does not stay

i agree with one of the reviewers that the armholes on this dress are big however the garment is tight around my chest area even though i am not chesty and lays next to my body perfectly so this is not problematic i dont feel like they are gaping holes there is just more area there than i would be used to i like the fabric this is made out of it is not quite as soft as i had hoped but it is comfortable i would say it is a medium weighta little more than i was expecting the flare is
this is a cute top but a little pricey for cotton t shirt material the arms and shouldersarmpit feel a little tight but is loose and flowy below the bust it is not as dressy in person as it appears in the photos a cute top for jeans or leggings as the length falls below the hip
i tried on the xs in the store and i dont need a petite in this but perhaps a xxs it is on the shorter side so no great on my muscular thighs if petite whereas the regular size hit me just above the knee the cut is away from the body a bit aline but not fitted the colors are gorgeous but i think this is more of a casual dress like brunch with the girlfriends for example love it it is now in my wish list for alter 
"i bought this dress for my college graduation and its truly gorgeous i love the loose breezy fit but it did feel just a little bit sacklike on me definitely moreso than i expected from looking at the product picture even after sizing down to a small which was comfortable and im usually a medium i ended up pairing it with a small belt really pretty dress just be advised  leaves a lot of room around the waist"
super cute dress  swingy flattering easy to wear the pattern is great and i felt like it was the perfect length for me  though im short so it may be too short for someone taller the dress runs big im usually a  but i got this is a  only complaint is that the pockets add unnecessary bulk
this dress is very pretty and well made it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down
"i ordered this top in all  colors love the peplumlookreturned the green which is actually my fav color but it wasnt a pretty shade of green and i dont think that it was a flattering contrast with the cream especially going into springsummerkept the yellow and the navy and lovethe navy is classic and the yellow is soft and flatteringits a very cute top runs a little large but is very pretty"
just as pictured this little top is just too cute the fit is exceptional and quite flattering another very feminine top and the yellow color is perfect i love pairing yellow with black of coursebut also with reds bluesand it looks great with white pedal pushers i think they call them cropped now a days at any ratethis is a first rate top that i highly recommend

this is a cute dress the quality is very good for a dress of this type the fabric is not too thin and the stitching is perfect i do think it runs a little small i typically wear an xxsp or a  and i purchased this in the regular xs regular xs is typically way too big but i took a chance on this one because i really liked it and i also like my dresses a little bit longer than shown on the models surprisingly it fit well in the chest and the armholes were not too big as is often the case
love this dress i agree with some of the other reviewers the arm holes are a little low but not a deal breaker im   and ordered the xs and it fits perfect would definitely recommend
i wanted to love this kimonoit is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabricnot a soft touch and because it runs small i bought the ml and usually wear a  but i couldnt bring the kimono together in the front for a belting option
just received this dress and i am in love the colors are beautiful perfect for both summer and fall the fabric is very soft and the fringe detail adds a nice feminine touch i was disappointed when i missed out on the first fringe stripe shift dress from holding horses at the beginning of this summer it was completely sold out in my size  however when i saw they restocked the dress in a new color and now lined yay i had to buy it would defin recommend
this looks beautiful and fits truetosize the material has enough weight so that it hangs well this is a very formfitting dress  i wouldnt recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style
i tried this on in the navywhite combination and loved it except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially if you can size it down so it fits you you will love it it is very soft an easy top to throw on feel comfy and look fantastic i sure wish it was smaller 
its a casual dress with a luxurious feel very flowy but the back panel gives it a bit more structure i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps i will very much appreciate it on hot days im anticipating a big of headache when ironing it but i appreciate that its not dry clean only im on the shorter side of average height and it hits me midthigh
i just revieved this skirt and like it a lot they did not have my size in petite so i ordered the regular length  it is very long i am   and tried it with  inch heels and still had about  inches dragging on the floor and will need to be hemmed in this picture the stitching around the flowers appear white but it is actuallly a shiny delicate gold thread in person hopefulluy it will not fray with wear i initially got a white top to go with it and it works but i think a red or navy
"ok so first things first im     and i took a small in this its your typical clothstone fabric and feel sooo goodi do agree that this romper is on the shorter side but i liked that about it it is far more flattering than the modeling photos online it doesnt look that oversized i can see where taller ladies wont go for the shortness but at  thats just not an issue for me the bottom is very flattering and doesnt do that long grandma butt that some rompers"
i actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model anyway i ordered the xs petite for  lbs  and it fits really nicely not too short the material is nice and soft nad looks like it may not wrinkles which would be a bonus the little gold buttons are super cute but you cant really wear this untied so it is pretty much a strictly tied short sleeves are flattering i think i may keep it 
"i saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute tried it on and was delighted the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice  a great nautical look the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly i am a  for reference and usually a size  on top i bought the top and didnt notice until i got home that it is dry clean only yikes i hate that this is a casual top to me"
lovely feels like you are wearing silk and hits for comfort in all the right places still mulling whether the short length is appropriate and if my athleticfull lower body is complimented by this cutieneeded a second opinion to push me over the top and take this home as a summer staple
this is well made and beautiful but it sometimes slides off so i feel like im adjusting it somewhat regularly
wasnt sure what to expect but i like it ordered size large and its a perfect fit the color is a blush beige it falls at the top of my hips i dont think you need a camo under it because the holes are small its a sweater type knit thats substantial but not heavy  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length
i love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch very retailer it does run slightly smaller but not in an extreme way id love to see more styling options for this top because im a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts haha
love thesethey are a lovely gauzey cotton so they actually feel light they do have volume however i dont believe they make you look bulkier though i suppose that depends on body type and how they are styled on top i first wore with a formfitting sleeveless chambray button down that said i sized down which meant the waistband was really too snug and so i sewed the button over to allow more room which is why i gave them four stars they have an elegant retro feel versatile for spring and

this is such a gorgeous tee with beautiful embroidery the colors are exactly as shown and while i take petite sizes at  i like the length of the regular for myself im  pounds and tried the xxs but found it to be too fitted and went with the xs in the end i do feel that it fits tts and that is just a personal preference
looked really cute on the hanger so i took it with me into the dressing room the fabric is super soft and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short you cant tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think youd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer i wish i could pull this offmaybe im just too old for it
picked this up yesterday in the muted teal great shape great color the pink one is way brighter in person and the green i think is more of a forest green each one was a little different super cute good price
"this dress is even better in person than in the photos online the colors are vibrant the material has a nice warm weight to it and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it didnt fall offthe dress does run a little small i think  i normally am an extra small but the small fit me very well"
this sweater dress is very beautiful in person the colors are very fall i actually decided against it only because i felt it was too busy for my personality as for the fit it runs fairly true to size maybe slightly small i tried on my usual medium but i think i would have sized up for a more relaxed look for reference im   lbs and wear a size  this could be quite a stunning piece on the right person
i think this blouse would work for petites it is super short and boxy looked nothing like the fit on the model sad to return it love the print
"i like this dress very much the colors are great and the style cute and casual its perfect with a pair of cognac riding boots and tightsit really is depicted well in the model photo although i think it may be cut somewhat shorter than it appears in the photo i am  and its shorter on me than on the model who i imagine is taller than methe dress is made of a substantial tight knit material i found it to be a bit boxy so i washed and tumble dried it hoping to tighten it up a bit t"

so i bought  of these first in xsp it was actually the regular length not the petite one it did have the problem mentioned by others regarding the arms armpit thighness issue i thought maybe the dress was mislabeled and i got a regular xs by mistake so i returned and order another xsp hoping i would get one with the right length but no the one i got has same issues as the first one why  petite dresses with regular length i think the dresses are defective the print is gorgeous and
beautiful sweater dress nice texture gorgeous pattern however not for my body type im  a size  and i carry my weight in hips butt  tummy area this dress is only slightly a line almost straight and even the xl didnt look flattering on me and the arms are definitely smaller and weird toothere is bunching in the pit area i tried on a large for comparison and it was too tight all over and there was a button missing too this def runs small and i think will be flattering on the
if you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body this doesnt do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest also i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons as several were off some of the dresses
tried this dress in two different sizes and just couldnt get a god fit for me i found the upper arms a little snug and unforgiving if you dont have slim arms it is a beautiful dress in person probably more so than in the photos and a nice thick quality feel it didnt work on my frame but i definitely recommend you give it a try

great maxi skirt that flows as you walk  i can see myself wearing this year round  im  and its still pretty long on me  i would have gotten the petite if it were available  i usually wear a  or  in pants and the medium skirt was perfect for me  so you may want to size down unless you have bigger hips    im not usually a fan of the drawstring waist but this one doesnt add bulk like most do   overall great skirt
this skirt was too big so i returned it but did like it well enough to reorder quality seems average my only complaint is the lining seems too short for the skirt why on a maxi is the slip lining a mini the first thing my husband said was that it needed a slip he didnt think it had one as he could see through the skirt to my knees this is very lightweight fabric but could be worn all year around depending on the leg wear that is worn with it it is a very versatile piece which is why i
first i noticed that the grey was more like a bluegreynavy which i dont mind because its still a nice unique color  i ordered petite size  and although these are very well madesturdy cords and fit at the ankle like the model pictured the thighcalves were surprisingly a bit too tight for me and my calves are s c r a w n y  this cord version doesnt seem as stretchy as some of their other styles so im going back for the standard 
i think i will really love this skirt it is comfortable and has a lovely sheerness to it it does have a bit of a weird long drop waist but it is very comfortable and still manages to be flattering i think this will be a great piece for transitioning to the fall and winter seasons i can wear it with short sleeves now and sweaters soon i am happy with my purchase

these bottoms run very small im   and  pounds with a  inch waist and both the xsmall and small were too small i think ill need a size medium
ok ladies i love the whole idea behind these pantscargo corduroy what and in a cool different navy color had to have them i got my usual size but in petite im  with shorter legs longer torso usually dont get petite in skinniest but for some reason did this time and i have to say the calves of these pants are like compression stockings the waist and boodie are perfect but the calves yikes but you know how when you want something to work so badi ordered my usual si
i ordered a size large and its so big i couldnt tell how it would look in a smaller size the waist cinched but theres too much fabric in the hips to be slimming the floral pattern is beautiful with light blue and lavender flowers that are generic enough to match with a variety of colors on top its too long for my frame the slip falls above knee so its sheer from there down i decided not to try a smaller size but recommend going down one or even two sizes
i feel both confident and comfortable in this dress it runs true to size though maybe just a little bit large i enjoyed wearing it from the getgo
i waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away i am disappointed the lace fabric is very stiff i should have listened to the previous reviewer i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress had the fabric been different i think it would be a great dress

i really wanted to like this but like other reviews say the knit fabric pills easily and i dont think the tank feels or looks as good as it would were it cotton a good deal on sale but i dont think it will hold up very long i got the tealwhite as blackwhite and coralnavy were sold out

"these pants are uhmazing i love that they have a seam in the front of the leg and in the back of the leg i didnt notice it in the photo online but in person it stands out more and anything vertical on my petite frame is a way to go these are my new favorite pantsi wish pilcro would make this style in more colors and fabrics i wear a  or a  and im glad i got the  because its true these are tight in the leg but i think thats a good thing since cords look awful when the"
love this skirt i wore it to work after purchasing this and i had at least  people comment on how beautiful it is many office ladies asked where i purchased it and one who asked the cost said it was worth the steep price the green in this skirt really pops out as do the gorgeous golden flowers the pockets are a nice addition as well
very flattering suit runs large i stumbled into this in my local store must have been a return i tried it on even though it was a size small not my usual medium fit like a glove covered my  chest i have tried many suits and this is best on my curvy shape flattering to tummy i am    not very toned at  years of age this suit is amazing highly recommend
"i thought these would be nice and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these cant be as much of a classic also the jewels make the jeans feel heavier fit is like most boyfriendgirlfriend jeans slightly loose not as much on me due to muscles and length on petite was close to what is shown here typical for me that it is still a bit longer as not only am i short but i have short legs for my shortnessso if you want that styl"
"the skirt looked orange online but is more of a nice red i do like orange too thoughi had orginially palced this in my basket as a to order later to see but my store had it glad because i would have ordered petite adn i do think that would have been too short for me not appropirate for work or in my  my age the skirt size  regular fit my waste and fell about one inch above my knee i am   lbs if it helps so petite would have been shortthe only thing tha"
this was adorable but looks much better on the lean flat chested model i am only  lbs and  but i am curvy and it just didnt do me any justice so i will be returning i think this would look better on someone more flat chested because it really accentuates the bust
it took a minute but once i figured out how to wear this i loved it it is meant to be oversized and for me looks best with leggings and ankle boots too much bulk to be worn with even a slim skirt im  curvy and long limbed the fabric has a thick high quality feel i find it quite soft and comfy the unexpected design of the ribbing gives it a subtle chic its fashion forward without trying too hard the cowl is really closer to a boatneck with an extra fold which works well for
the colors in this skirt are gorgeous a super pretty emeraldgreen color with graphic silver and black flowers this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down im loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party the weight of the skirt isnt heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too

i ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes im  and slender but with a  bust and the medium was too loose and long sleeves fell past my wrists i would exchange this for a small for a better fit but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal  not flattering on a farskinned blonde i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair as it does on the girl in the photo the texture is great and i re
i love this skirt i feel in love with it instore and when i couldnt stop thinking about it a few weeks later i knew i had to get it beautifully made with high quality materials and so flattering fits very well for my figure big butt and hips w small waist sits just below my belly button and accentuates my waist and slims my hips must have
this shirt is comfy fits well the color pink or dusty rose works well with most outfits but the front hook is illplaced and often visible it could be tucked under better so as not to show but it isnt and does show i feel that i frequently need to fluff it up to hide the hook otherwise i like it but i wouldnt have bought it unless it was on discount which it was
nice modern print vibrant colors and not sheer no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot
loved the idea of these as soon as i saw them  great mid weight jean  a little large in the waist  the rhinestones sparkle and i received tons of complements when i wore these jeans  great dressed up or down
i purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great comfortable and forgiving top this top again runs a bit large so i ordered a size down and it fits great i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color i ordered pink but i would consider it more of an orangish red color not my favorite but not terrible either overall it is a great shirt
i am a pilcro hyphen fan and have bought nearly every embellished jean theyve made in the last few years these however are just not for me i love the faded wash and i thought the embellishment would be fun for the fall and holidays however theres just so much of it its beautifully done but the jeans actually feel bulky and stiff in the pocket and upper thigh area ive had other beaded jeans but they didnt feel quite so crunchy when i wore them one other note these seem to ru

ok so this top runs extremely large for referencei am a typical medium but i ended up purchasing an extrasmall besides the sizing issue the style is super cute and perfect for any summer occasion whether casual or more formal i definitely recommend ps beware it does wrinkle easily lol
omg i just received this dress and it is absolutely gorgeous fits me like a glove lovely rich reds and quality for reference im  and  lb and the  petite was perfect i could have even gone with the  regular if its within your means i highly recommend d
really cute and comfy and casual skirt i am looking forward to travelling in this skirt and running around for the summer i did size down one size highly recommend will get lots of wear
these shorts are a must they are so soft and go with every top imaginable i bought these in an xs and feel they run tts for reference i am  and normally wear a  or  you will not regret this purchase
bought the blue romper and love it to bits definitely a summer staple im   lbs and generally consider myself proportioned but curvy on the bottom and the xs fit perfectly many rompers have really short inseams but this one is a relatively conservative  so i feel comfortable and can dress it up or down ive worn it a few times and received tons of compliments its super comfortable forgiving and flattering i originally purchased it in black in pxs and ps because at the ti
love love love like another chambray item i have they feel stuff and rough after washing but once you put them on they soften up and look great
i purchased this dress in  colorsbeautiful and so comfortable highly recommend
ive noticed this sports bra several times in my storealong with a whole line of products that share this fabric and didnt feel necessarily compelled to try it on but i finally did this last time at retailer i pretty much predicted what i was going to think of it i like the back with the extra strappy open section but that is where it ends the fabric is not particularly flattering and i didnt think the bra accentuated my chest i do have a small bust size but i have a lot of sports

i recommend this dress for women wth a small bust this is an absolutely gorgeous dress but it runs very small through the bodice and is almost empire waisted if you remember the coral dress from spring by the same designer it fits the same but this one has a tiered skirt so sad i love this dressthe colors and design are beautiful
these are great the colors are a little different in real life they are really great but i think they are a bit delicate and i hope they hold up
"i tried this on the fit was true to size as far as no cup size goes  got xs was ok the pattern i like and was totally fine on my pale skin but think of it i would not likely wear this without a tank or shirt support seemed ok too i do like the crisscross detail in the abck thinking about keeping it but i jsut dont need it right this second dilemmacaveat not been tested in a workout obviously since i am not sure i will keep it may chance it on sale"
i was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasnt what i was searching for this sweater like on the model is quite large although i wanted a large sweater the fit of this one didnt fit well on me it has more of a boxy feel to it i usually wear a medium but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me i
the dress is lovely the beadwork creates a nice accent it runs big i got a size  which should work out just fine for me but oddly it is big and i wish i got a  now there arent any in that size and i will either have to return the dress or tailor it i would recommend this dress just consider ordering a size down from your usual
i am a true size xl in my  i wore a small and then medium so i know whereof i am speaking here i tried this dress on in my local retailer store this designer as a handful of retailer designers seem to do simply enlarges the fabric measurement outward as they add another size the problem is a funny thing happens to womens breasts as they gain weight is this so difficult to understand as a size small i was an a cup as a medium i was a b cup now years later as a size  i am a d cup
"i love wide neck  offshoulder tops i think they are very flattering at first i thought the fabric was too thin but then realized since i want to wear this with a fuller party skirt its nice that ir is not too bulkyi actually think it will be really cute with white jeans in the summer and great way to dress up a casual outfit"

"this arrived just in time for the winter snow stormi was glad i had read previous reviews advising that it ran large and that the gray sleeves are surprisingly attached to the sweater and do not represent a separate top beneath the sweateri got a size small and it fits perfectly its big and boxy but doesnt make feel like i look fat with slimfitting trousers  its super stylish"
very disappointed runs small in chest and too long the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail i dont think  this dress is worth the price it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze i have been in the fashion industry for over  years and this is a miss mark in my opinion put it back on the rack and save your  for something better at sweet retailer

i love this sweater i didnt buy it the first time when i tried it at the store because the buttoned look created a bulk on one side and i thought that this was very weird it might have been what i was wearing underneath that day or that particular sweater but then at  off i decided to give it another try and im happy that i did i bought the navy and i love the feel of the material sizing down makes all the difference too i wasnt fan of the attached sleeves at first as they are made
the denim is soft and very comfortable the color also is very dark and goes well with most anything the style is oversized for baggy look and for that reason the sides of the overalls gape open requiring a long top i usually wear a size  in citizen jeans and ordered small in the overalls and had to return for an xs i do recommend for comfort and fun they look great with booties or flats and hit just at the ankle
has i read the reviews would have realized the tshirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft i am returning it cause i do not like the tshirt sleeve would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted
"its hard to tell how you will like this top unless you try it on first  yes it runs big and wide but not long which i like  yes it it is fairly sheer but the design allows for a fitted tank  i found it adorable once those first two issues were corrected its a cute late summer top easy breathing for humidity i like this top as well because it allows for a normal bra strap so you feel covered but the sexy shoulders peek out it also is a bit longer in the back than the front wh"
this looks great with the pilcro lace bottom white jeans i bought the yellow and blue and it is flattering on longer in the back i love the style of the sleeves very flattering style and fun flirty and feminine slightly see through depending on your modesty level a nude bra may be just fine or else a nude cami a really fresh look for summer i do not think it looks cheap i do think it is overpriced but i have a hard time finding tops that hit me at the right length in front and are not

this is the sort of top i love to find at retailer its versatile because the fabric is comfortable enough to wear everyday and the lace gives it a dressy feminine feel i love the navy because the white behind it shows up the lace beautifully the yellow behind the white is also very pretty its fuller than it looks in the product shots even in an xxs its long on me at  but its fine not sure i can wear with shorts because of the length but good with a mini the neck is also a little h
first i must say that this dress fits beautifully in my usual xs    lbs and the geometric pattern is adorable i often have a fit problem with dresses i think due to a long waist where the fabric bunches up by my lower back not so with this dress it shows off my curves without being super tight and the fabric has a little stretch so the dress isnt binding for my age however  this dress is just a little too short for the office so im sending it back also i felt that
the material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design it looks very elegant and romantic you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though because of the design of the straps it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath overall very pretty and i would highly recommend i purchased the white and yellow version

such an easy to wear and nicely cut summer dress it does not wrinkle has pretty colors and fits very well i havent washed it yet but i like the idea that it can be machine washed highly recommend the fabric is good quality a little bit thick for hot days though

i was so excited to wear this shirt even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot and i found that the same thing happened to me it also clings tightly to the body i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders
so hard to guess fit and size so because i carry my weight in my tummy i ordered an xl they were too big the waistband is a nice very wide comfy elastic but fit loose the legs were a bit baggy too and too long for my frame the fabric is soft and has a bit of a contrast down the sides of the leg due to the length i decided not to reorder a smaller size i think youd be safe to size down in these
this dress was absolutely beautiful in person but it didnt end up working out for me i wear a  the  fit but i have a  chest and because of that the waistline didnt sit low enough  it was just below my bust instead of at my natural waist i really wanted this to work and think it would be great for the right person seemed tts love the detailing
"first off kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re the color on these they are not a dark rinse at all  not even close theyre a lighttomedium hue with fading down the front of the thighs with that in mind i do like the color  especially for spring  but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photoi typically wear a  depending on the brand and waist rise these were an online return t"
i would suggest trying this on in store the xs wouldve worked thats my normal size but i ended up preferring the s it does have low armholes the s in the yellow was just right for me but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked still a very cute and classic top that i know ill get a lot of use out of
i picked this dress up in a size   fits tts i have a  chest  lbs and  ft  inches in height i have an hourglass figure and the size  was too big and the  fit just right the skirt is lined and the upper bodice part is not it says on the tag hand wash which is a plus because dry cleaning is not a plus hits me just about  inches above the knee the thick lace detailing is very special and price point with the dress promo made me feel this would be a great dress for the holiday
love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back also it is a flowly top so you will need to size down however because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chestarms this didnt work for me as it accentuated my normal body type as in not the model type i am not overweight but it definitely didnt flatter my chest area seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first
"i actually like this top but i am wearing it as a cowl neck rather than offtheshoulder i found it at the store so i didnt even know it was supposed to be that way i have the ivory color and it it does have some tanbeige specks in it but i dont mind this at all it adds some texture and warmth i think it is a great neutral top for work it has a double layer of fabric so not sheer at all and this keeps it smooth over my middle without a tank or cami i am an xs in most retailer to"

i just got this tank and love it it has the perfect amount of swing but does run a little large the underlay was more yellow than i expected but i think it adds a nice amount of brightness to the top this will be a summer staple
"i purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks so i purchased the tan jacket i found it to less tan as an olive color not my favorite color for me but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hopedthe jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work recommend pretty true"
i purchased this in the blue motif  i am   pounds and got an xs i love everything about this tee it looks great with jeans and i love it with my white denim shorts i havent worn it off the shoulder yet  i think it looks great as a regular tee i get compliments whenever i wear it  so happy with this purchase
not in love with this one the fabric is thin and seems cheap it seems overpriced even on sale and it runs a bit small along the bust i could maybe get away with it without a bra but after  kids braless isnt my best look and i dont think the print is a pretty in person as it is online  cant quite put my finger on why maybe a little darker in person that said the fit is flattering the cinched waist is lovely and the skirt is nice and flowy even so this one is going back
love love love this jacket im able to dress it up or casual the hint from a review i read to button the lapels back worked awesome good quality has a bit of stretch for bulky shirt to wear underneath would definitely recommend if like the military jacket style
im obsessed with this top i actually love that the sides are a bit higher than the front and back i feel like that gives it shape i bought jeans similar to the pic here and they look so good together love
saw this top online and hoped for the best my hopes were rewarded lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also i asked  friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments
love marrakech for their jackets this piece is wonderful i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose the body still fits buttoned up nice and tailored the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk looks great worn open too i think the best part is the cut and material i am   and  lbs curvy
this dress was really odd i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but thats about it the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large i was just very underwhelmed with this dress also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution overall its okay just hated it on me
i carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra the colors are deeper than shown but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top i liked that the sides are shorter but overall its just not my style better suited i think for taller slimmer bod
i love linen i know its a pain with the wrinkles but its just a very nice crisp clean feel this vest is wonderful it fits very nice once you size down and can work as a bathing suit cover up im using it with my linen pants and skirts and everyone has asked me where did you get thati think theyre all gone by now but if they arent grab it while you can its a must have for any womans closet

this suit is so flattering on great support and slimming for my postthree times baby body i ordered this suit and the skirted maillot by swim by retailer in the white floral i loved the pattern of the floral more but dont think any chest size larger than a c cup would be supported in that suit
this dress is shorter than it looks on the model im  and it hits about  inch above my knee it also runs a little big in my opinion
"pros soft quality top true to size and would look great a little tucked in and off the shoulderreality it will be hard to keep the shoulders from sliding up and on me at least it looked really mehkind of dumpyim  normally a  and i bought the medium herefit was good its billowy and accurately displayed in the pictures so as an hourglass shaped gal id need to tuck in the front or all or accessorize to give it a little shape i really liked the feel a"
"tried this one because the ruffled detailing at the collar and sleeves appealed to me as well at the cute button details along the back and the overall color and look of itpros love the ruffle trim along the collar bottom and wrists it gives it a really romantic feel to it a definite winter piece its extremely warm and very thick and heavy which i found covered any lumps and bumps nicely ran tts im   hourglass and  lbs and tried on the medium and fo"
"this chambray halter top is a good summer staple from cloth and stone but it is better for longer waists than mine and smaller busts fyi  broad shouldersback short waist  normally i wear a m in cs and that is what i tried in this halter topoddly the overall length was okay but the armholes were very low in the m the bust area was tighter than it should have been for a easy summer top i think that this is due to the overall length of the bodice in other words the top ha"
this is a beautiful dress for fall the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first i think a l might fit a bit better so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit it is also very long i need to hem it about  i never know which size to order with this brand i vary between l and xl
"this suit is so adorable i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me the suit is comfy seems well made and fit nicely but although it fit technically i dont like the way it cuts me off at the thigh its not flattering for me at all the suit is kind of a neoprene material so its thicker than a normal bathing suit so i think even though it isnt lined it might not be seethrough but i didnt get it wet to test it out in terms of fit i think it"

i tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy with the straps tied tightly around my neck it was like the cups just flipped out and open i am a regular b cup and i dont think it was sizing though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes the cup did not right and for this reason would make this absolutely impossible to wear unfortunate because the design is so pretty
"on me thsi was ginormous looked like a mu mu it is pretty but there was just too much fabric even in the smallest size the quality seems nice and it looks pretty but overwhelming i will say i think it would work on tail lean people i have pretty muscular shoulders so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look  pounds heavier no joke fabric is soft though give it a try just not for meref  lbs   in waist"
this dress is just lovely beautiful drape comfortable material it is a print that looks like embroidery i am usually an xs or s and im glad i got the xs as i can tell the s would have been too large the back waistband is elastic and it is easy to move in beautiful neutral colors i think it can be dressed up or down easily with the right shoes and jewelry only negative comments there is only a half slip and i wish it was lined more although that will make it easier to wear during the
i was surprised how much i like this shirt the fit is really pleasing at first i thought it would be a whatever shirt but i think i will actually wear it a lot more it will look cute dressed up with a cute necklace and flats the price is a bit high for this top but i felt it was worth it since it is so hard finding a casual shirt thats not your basic tee
this is a pretty everyday piece to add to your wardrobe the color is a little less pink and more peach than depicted in the photo and the top is just a bit on the short side but i was afraid that if i sized up it wouldnt give me more length but maybe look boxy instead im    with an athletic build and ordered the small
am typically a size  and could barely get the extra small on which is a first was very cute in theory but id suggest sizing up maybe 
the photos really doesnt do this sweater justice when i saw it in store ii was really drawn to the colors which are a bit brighter than they appear in the photos this will be great over jeans or slim pants i usually wear a l or xl and i went with the l which is still roomy enough to layer but not too big at  it drapes nicely and covers my rear end the arms are a bit long on me but it is a common issue for me as i have short arms others have mentioned the arms being big but i think the
the cups on this suit are  ridiculous  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor seams were messed up a big pull right on the front i brought it back sad because the design was adorable just poor execution
loving this top feels comfy and casual like a sweatshirt but pairs great with a pencil skirt or dress pants to wear to work easy to dress up and down and i get so many compliments on it its fraying a tiny bit on the front but i think that adds to the notsoprecious vibe im   and the m works great
this suit is the most flattering suit i have owned in a while as well as the most comfortable though the suit is not lined the light wetsuit material holds me in and is supportive despite the open back and the slight looseness of it if you do any water sports i think this is a perfect suit i did purchase some silicone covers for myself however to avoid looking like a farrah fawcett throwback
i love love love this top the cutout pattern in front is such a unique look and is a great way to add some fun to your usual tshirt and jeans look its well made and the fit is great i got it in petite s which worked great lengthwise
i got compliments the moment i walked into the office with those they look like leather so much that i had to ensure some people that only some polyester had to die so i could wear them  i am slim but i think those pants are cut so well and hang so nicely they make everybody look slimmer they are also super soft very comjfortable and the pockets are big enough to hold my beloved smart phone securely without showing a bulge the pants look very elegant when paired with the right shoes
this is a very well made sweater it is a nice weight great for cool mornings and evenings i dont think you can dress this up but it is perfect with casual pants and jeans i found it runs large but that makes it suitable for layering over other tops
i saw this online and loved it then when it was on sale i went into the store and tried it on and i couldnt resist the only size that was left in stores was an xs petit and i didnt think that it would fit me because i am usually a regular sm but it was super comfortable and very stylish it wasnt too big or too small it fit me just right without any awkwardness
sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured no ruffle such a bummer sleeves are much longer and yes its teared in the front and back also the button opening on the back is much longerlarger in my opinion ill most likely keep it but consider the mentioned if buying
"i personally like light garment and simple design for my daily dresses  it meets my needsi personally recommend it to customers"
bought the gray and peach in the store and loved it so much ordered the other colors online this top is very comfortable and stylish it stands out from the crowd as just enough different to be very unique and trendy but still a classic look the sweater front is very soft and the back has a bit of a silk feel but not sheer i also like that the back is a bit longer than the front
i ordered two colors of these in   i am keeping them because they feel wonderful on but they definitely have to be hemmed i measured the inseam on both pairs to be closer to  inches   inches is not a petite length
this sweater is so lovely i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey very soft and comfortable the back doesnt wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone very flattering i highly recommend it

"i saw this top online and fell in love with the overall casual looki ordered all  colors and they just arrivedlove love love they are soft comfortable and a have a very flattering casual fitthe understated ruffled details add the special something that is so retailerthey are sophisticated yet prettythe orange is more vibrant in person and is a beautiful shadethe plumpurple is a rich unique and pretty colorthe navy is a perfect denim colora fantastic basic"
at  tall its hard to find pants that fit my inseam  and these fit the bill i normally wear a  or  tall in pants from brands like ag or paige but i bought these in a  tall as i find pilcro tends to run large they are soft and comfortable and dont stretch out  sizes by the end of the day which is great they feel like leggings the wine color looks just like the images for those who find measurements helpful im  tall  with about  hips and a  inseam
the picture is accurate i got the plum version the color and effect are really unique the fit is tts i wear an  in tops and the medium is fine the sleeves are flattering  belled but not ridiculous the fabric is soft if the body of the top was a little less wide it would be a  star item with flare legs i think it will balance out the volume of the cut
this piece fits true to size and is very flattering on sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat but this wasnt an issue at all probably because of the intricate lace details the fabric is substantial enough that i dont feel like itll get a hole in it after multiple wears
this printcolor combination is really pretty i think its a little muted compared to the picture but still very pretty it is definitely longer than expected  im  and it almost touches the floor will definitely need to wear with heels colors will actually work in the fall with boots and in spring with heeled sandals it actually has a shorter underskirt so theres no accidental show i really like the dark blue wrap extra fabric at top  sits below the waist and will help hide imp
"i saw this dress online and i ordered immediatelyit has everything i love my fav color a peplum and feminine cut out detailsi ordered my usual size medium and it was too tight in the chest and i am just average loved it so reordered in a size largeif you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper endof your size medium  and i am usually a  so needed to go upthe reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med"
i love this top the design is very good i love the pleats at the back and i tried both colors i prefer blue even though both look good the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back i usually wear xl but bought this in an l which was also very loose i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats i am keeping the blue because i like this style with fitted pants it would work well
i dont have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color i generally wear a mauveish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too unfortunately i just dont find the shape of the top to be flattering its really long so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but im not really thin like her and i have a larger chest it just doesnt
i ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did mine does not have any weird smell at all i ordered a medium and i wear a size  it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings with coverage the detailing on the yoke is so pretty i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe
i ordered the black not yet available  through my store as the xs was too big and we tried ordering xs petite but it was not yet available so we ordered xxs i am  it fits nicely but  as mentioned in previous review  it is thin not see through in black but thin cut is nice though i still think petite would fit me better i n length but xxs was good got a think if i will keep or not as htis is a nice summer basic

i always look at jumpsuits but they never seem to work for me because of my height  and petite stature i ordered the xxsp and it fits perfectly so comfortable and made of high quality silk which you can really feel is well made love that there is no zipper just a hidden elastic tube top and a hook and eye below the nape of the neck plan on wearing this for my  birthday with heels or booties and a cropped leather jacket
"i bought this in size xl and it ran small along the waist  bottom hemline im pearshaped so its an awkward fit ill wear it tucked in or belted they used a lot of material in the sleeves  through the top portion i wish they hadnt made it such a narrow cut along the bottomthe sleeves are very pretty the embroidery they used for the cutouts is a little rough  scratchy since i got it on sale  like the color im keeping it i recommend trying this on if you can"
i bought this top in my usual size large and it is slightly big but not so much that i would want to size down  the material is slightly itchy but i think that its worth it because its such a pretty top i absolutely love the detail at the top  it is beautiful  if you wear a nude bra you cant see the strap lines through the material  i also love the coloring of this top  this is a great top that i can see myself wearing with dress pants for work or with jeans for a more casual look
the picture doesnt do these justice they are beautiful and a musthave for summer date nights i am  and hover between  i tried on the regular size instore and they were way too long so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band not styled like the pic they literally feel like you are wearing nothing youll receive so many compliments  trust me
i made the mistake of ordering a medium instead of large and have the same fit issues as other reviewers it is tight in the back through the shoulders so if youre considering it i would stick with your larger of your size range the print is beautiful as is the fabric it looked okay on me from the side but i am short waisted it fell at the perfect length on me too theres just something about the fit that didnt wow me so i dont plan to reorder but i do think it would be lovely on thinne
lovely top with details and a unique color i have read some other reviews and i honestly dont know why it is getting bad reviews it is linen but not scratchy by any means like linen it does give with wear so i recommend sizing down as it does run a little large with a nude bra you wont see your straps and i would dryel this no washing of any kind linen shrinks overall great top and i was glad i snatched one up
i love this tank basic but super sexy im an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so ill take it i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small im torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt
i took a risk on this one i wasnt sure if the shirt was more green or more blue i look better in blue it turns out that the shirt is a bit more green but i think it still looks good im  and  lbs i got a medium i could have maybe gotten a small but i like the medium the shirt has a bit of a vintage look to it which i like all in all good
this dress is stunning i loved the cut and seam detailing it is very flatteringif it fits i have a curvy athletic build and usually wear a size  i am also smaller busted and this dress was too tight around my ribs back and tummy i bought the large and it doesnt come in a bigger size  it is very well made and completely lines i highly recommend this dress but again only it if fits you
actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute  i like the look it adds  i really want to get more colors   i normally wear everything from retailer in small  and even though this fit it was small for a small  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium

it definitely smells like vinegar but it went away after a few hours i dont think its itchy its kind of baggy and kind of has an ombrã© look to it fading down to darker it looks casual in the pic but i can wear it out at night with cute earrings
this vest is a really cute idea for layering so i ordered my usual size medium and while it fit it just added about  pounds onto my frame ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down but it just made me look so bulky sizing down wouldnt have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small its a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too im   and usually wear a  or 
love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric for the first few wearings i was in love then it began to pill horribly    would not recommend my mother said thats going to pill up and i ignored her and she was right
this is stunning its almost snug for a  im   lb but that might be because its strapless its constructed with a bra inside so you can get away without wearing one i cant wait to wear this and im going to have to find an event good enough to deserve this dress i feel like audrey hepburn in this
the material of this swimsuit is amazing the swimsuit is expensive but it is high quality in person definitely one id recommend buying
i think this shirt is so cute it is wellmade its a flattering fit and its unusual it still is a neutral though so you can wear it with lots of things im really happy i bought it
looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me just for comparison and i wish all reviewers would include this i am  and weigh  pounds i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater unfortunately i have returned it
this is longas it is shown in the picture i am five  and its actually too long for me it looks a bit matronly on as its just so long i loved the fabricits not heavy and its super soft i think it runs one size big its made very well and as i stated it is a nice fabric with a soft hand it would be nice for a crisp fall day that being said the length just isnt right and does nothing for me im five  and slender  i definitely do not think a petite woman would like this or be

"soft cozy and cute but pilled badly after  wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home onlyfor this reason i cannot recommend felt like i wasted my moneyi purchased the xs petite  im   lbs and i could have gone down to xxs but i was ok with it being looser"
wanted to love this dress bit it wasnt to be strange fit and doesnt drape nicely as in the photo also the blue color was much darker in person wouldnt recommend
i really love the fit of this dress i said it runs true to size and it really doeseven with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailerthere is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress id never bought anything by this brand before and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress and it is not lined im still hoping its not see through however for me the style makes up for
i have tried this on several times now and have yet to pull the trigger i like the coral color the best for its versatility the detailing on this cardigan is fantastic i especially like the back the stitching is already very flattering but then the pleats really add an extra touch the only reason i have not bought it yet is that i wish it was slightly longerespecially with it being a cashmere piece i am slightly worried about it shrinking in any way which would make it much too short an
"i had never tried on a romper or jumper the print of this changed my mind and im glad for it it looks amazing on is easy to wear i kind of wish it were lined but its probably better unlined to keep it light and cool for the summer i did end up using double stick take bc the front was so low but it was worth it"
this jacket is exactly what i was looking for it is a lightweight and comfortable material that will be perfect for fallspring and for layering during a mild winter i am   lbs and generally wear a small  but i ordered a medium in this jacket and am happy i sized up the jacket is roomy but the cinched waist makes it flattering rather than shapeless id definitely recommend this anorak to anyone
these pants are a fun way to mix it up from the usual dark solid colored pants the print is a perfect balance between subtle and bold the fabric is soft and stretchy and i love that these pants are washable i im petite  but my petite size was sold out so i bought these pants in the regular length they are soooo long that i think even the petite size wouldnt have ended up cropped on me having said that i like them enough that i plan to keep them and have them shortened i usually s
just bought this weekend and had to size down im usually a small in jackets and went with the xs retailer has had this style for the last few years and ive missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out well worth the price point i think it will be a very versatile jacket for sizing reference im  and 
cashmere is soft as a feather yet warm easy to wear and the pointelle stitches are lovely i feel lovely wearing this and im really not that kind of lady so if you imagine a side of yourself wanting to try out feeling lovely bite the bullet and buy this cardigan it does run small in my bust area but all the rest fits well
was excited to find an retailer pkg awaiting in my mailbox ripped open the package and immediately tried on the sweater it did not disappoint i bought turquoise in size medium my regular retailer cardigan size i am  medium build and i find the regular size fits me true to size it isnt too long on me at all i think the way the sweater drapes in a curve shape as it flows downs to the length of sweater makes it very accommodating for various heights figures and is a flattering style for cu
i am   pounds size  sometimes a  sometimes a  athletic build these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist about  extra inches of space i dont think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large i will need to get them tailored
i wish i had sized up on this one you cant tell from the photo but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back the back is extremely flatteringly but the front not so much the shorter sides are a little awkward there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan and it lays kind of strange the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile very soft of course i got the blue teal color i found the color to be true to the color online
good quality dress except the lining is very sheer and thin the inner strap of the lining ripped when i tried it on so be careful putting it on once on it fits true to size the lining is nice to have so i kept it even though the strap ripped if you are on the fence between sizes i would recommend going smaller to avoid having this style of dress look maternity on you
i absolutely fell in love with this dress when i saw it online but unfortunately it just didnt fit right the bust and bodice not designed for curves and the dress just didnt fit correctly i think it would work better on very slim figures
ok so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear ill have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these first they are so so comfortable soft material stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering im   lbs curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size  there is a little bit of room which im happy with so they dont squeeze the love handle area or make it unco
i just purchased this adorable top at my local retailer store not really expecting to find anything i saw this one so i tried it on in my usual size small and it fit me perfectly  i bought the black with the colorful print and think its even prettier in person it looks cute with the ties either open or closed and the material is nice and soft also the arm holes arent too large which is always a nice plus
i dont think its possible to say enough good things about this dress the fit is beautiful im   and am a  the material is soft and swishes around your legs in a delightful way and the length has all the positives of a maxi dress without dragging on the ground it doesnt show bra straps it looks good with either heels or a trusty pair of birkenstocks the pattern is fun essentially its the perfect summer dress
i like this top it provides a nice pop to the fallwinter dark wardrobe pieces the picture gives off a blue hue but the top is black kind of a dusty black the picture also gives the impression that the leaves are turquoise but theyre actually more green at any rate it is nice addition to my very dark winter wardrobe i cannot wait to wear it with white denim like the model and something in the green family i definitely recommend it
i would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure these pants seem to be cut straight up and down the fabric is not soft the color is slightly more muted in person and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model
i got this top in the black floral print the print is very pretty and so is the neckline but the body is very loose and shapeless its not flattering i think the shirt is a little too short as well it would be nicer if it was longer nevertheless it is a pretty top
"this is such a darling velvet dress understated yet eye catching i am very fond of it the cut is flattering to all and the gathered fabric does not add bulk to the waist there is a fun tulle underskirt to give just the right amount of volume the straps creep ever so slightly toward being off shoulder but fear not because there are loops and fasteners to hold your bra in placei am very thrilled to have found my holiday party dress so early and cant wait to wear it"
this top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering i would not recommend
i wanted this dress in the turquoise motif but it sold out so quickly i tried on about  dresses in my local store and this was the clear winner i got the blue and white motif which has enough visual interest with the way the pattern flows across the dress i found the dress to be slimming and very comfortable you can throw it on and not think about flashing anything when you bend over or the skirt flying up in the breeze or needing a strapless bra the skirt flows really nicely and over
this dress looks way better on you than sitting on the hanger the design really flatters your body and the waist area makes you look very skinny highly recommend the length is also perfect just the right length for a maxi dress long enough but short enough to show off your shoes as well
the turquoise print is absolutely stunning i love the feel of the fabric the drape
i hesitated to spend the money on this sweater but somehow knew it would be my goto sweater for the season when i tried it on i knew i made the right decision  it feels luxurious and fits like a dream the pop of color on the pocket is perfect to make a statement and to add something different from all those other sweaters the fit is tts
i really love this shirt and bought it in several colors i wish it came in white and in black because its a great basic i think it also works well for business casual attire
so so cute i am    and the  fit me perfectly i expected the m or  to be too small wore them the first day i received them i have a large waist  hips about  and the  fits great not tight love the material and the workmanship is tops i think they are a great buy especially on sale wore them with a hei hei jacket also on sale cant get much better
this jacket doesnt look all that special in the photos provided i found it at my local store and i knew it was mine the moment i tried it on it has that boxy shoulder look i associate with  power suits i call this look full sigourney weaver and it is marvelous perfect for a lunch date with harrison ford circa  so happy with this purchase highly recommend
" this looks so cute on the model doesnt it i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants but it looks cute that said keep in mind the model is probably  feet  inches tall im  feet  inches tall and this jacket came down to my knees im not kidding the  length sleeves were at my wrist so more like  sleeves im normally a size  in cartonnier jackets but this only comes s m or l the medium is really a size  which was too tight across the shoulders and"

cute shirt it looked big so i ordered a size smaller worked fine would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back fun shirt though
"love this top it is exactly as pictured online its a beautiful coral pink color  perfect for summer i think the description says red but it is definitely pink i love the swiss dot material the bell sleeves the ruffled bottom they all work perfectly together to make for an adorable top it almost seems as if it can be worn off the shoulder due to the elastic neckline but i prefer it on as pictured on the model the fit is tts i ordered an xs and that is what i usually wear fro"
i loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store and brought home a size med its a nice weight of material lined and very classy i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suitjackets for business meetings but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet i realized how much it looked like a labcoat i am not giving up if it goes on sale ill order a small to see if it is more flattering but at this point its a nogo
"i got this i n regular xs i am xsp or xxsp so it fit fine considering is boxy it is very cute and delicate so despite being casual it gives a nice dressup kick to any jeans shorts capris im very happy with this top and like it very much and definitely recommend it to everybody just be careful since is delicate"
i ordered this dress in raspberry the color is beautiful in person i am usually a petite size  and it fits perfectly the only thing about this dress that might drive me crazy is that it seems to wrinkle easily other than that i think its a great dress for summer
this top is beautiful in the model shot but average in person it ran really small i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium it barely fit over my chest and was pretty short i am  also the material is very thin not so much that you can see your undergarment but if you get cold everyone will know it also for the price i expected a sturdier fabric i would recommend holding out for sale if you are interested in this top
tried this on just for fun today and ended up taking it home in the glorious blue many have commented on the sizing issue for reference i am   lbs  slender athletic build i bought a size  and it fits like a dream no large arm holes no gaping buttons  and the length is perfect yes it will wrinkle its linen thats part of the look i feel this will fill a void in my closet that was missing i was wearing flat ankle wrap espadrilles when i tried it on and it looked super cute
this is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts it is wide but has a lovely flowswing to it love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top
i was so pumped to see a slightly different version of last years military swing shirtdress because i loved the idea of it but it was just was too voluminous and short for me well this year i ordered a size up remembering that last years dress ran right in the chest and shoulders i guessed right this time in a size up i had breathing room and was much more comfortable this dress is also a lot less billowy there is sting definitely a swing but a much less dramatic version my issue
"fabric is the nice comfortable hh fabric they have been using to make dresses and shirts it wrinkles a little though also feel heavy though not too warm i like the collar not being a fold over teh dress wasnt too short on me  in front and does go longer in the back high low  not an issue for me i ordered the navyi decided not to keep it only because i dont really need it and they make a similar version every year but if you dont have it yet good to havei am  lbs"
"this is dress is great for an occasion  such as a weddingi wanted to keep this dress for such occasion  but there were  drawbacks i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package there it had some sort of oilpetroleum based product smell the other drawback is the hips  it just flared out more than i wanted i think that a belt would have solved that but i usually dont find belts in my sizeas for the fit it is true to size im a true petite and the  fit great"
from the online pics i would never think to try this on but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets so glad i did i purchased in green and navy i love the neck line when buttoned up almost military jacketish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket super soft material i purchased a size  and i am  and  lbs

my title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater the print is super cute and the price point is great but this sweater was so itchy that i couldnt even keep it on for longer than a minute it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath but dont even think about wearing it by itself
unless you have the body of the model  tall and very thin and wear a really small size  dont even think about getting this dress its literally a heavy sack it hit right above my knee in the front and basically midcalf in the back the material is nice but its an awful shape
i love this top the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering its so pretty the top has great movement and pairs well with so many things the top hits somewhere around my waist but wasnt too short i highly recommend this top
there were no reviews when i purchased this dress from the picture with the model the dress looks to be a straight shift dress i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isnt straight it is also pretty large i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and im not sure i will keep it still on the fence dress is shorter than pictured as well sleeves are shorter than shown now after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture i think the model is holding her a
material is heavy enough to provide warmth on a crisp day or evening  add poncho or large warm scarf to keep colder temps  bay sure wish this came in blk i bought mauve  just love it
im   and this dress fits exactly like shown on the model hits right above my knees in front and an inch or so below my knees in the back i didnt find it to be too blousey at all im more pear shaped so i like that this is flowey around my hips and bum purchased a size  and it fits well over my chest and arms if youre busty or have muscular arms i can see how this might feel more restrictive great staple to my wardrobe
i loved this top when i first saw it i tried on my usual size l and there is no stretch through the bust so it totally flattened my chest a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xls that must have been returned i tried them on and they fit perfectly i suggest sizing up if you have a chest this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap skinny jeans and boots
now this is a summer staple love the design of the bib of this tee super soft great neutral charcoal color and can be dressed up or down it is loose id recommend sizing down
"unfortunately i am not toned enough to truly show off this beautiful blouse armholes are cut in a bit too far for my  year old arms was hoping for a pop of color as a basic sleeveless top to layer under sweaters and jackets for traveling but the neckline wasnt layering as i had hoped i am only  but want a bit more lengthi think this blouse is best worn uncovered as shown on a toned body that does not require the longer length i prefer seems to be well made sadly i must return"
i had high hopes for this cool top i ordered it in xxs because no petites were available at the time and i think the size is just right im   lbs  i just suspect it looks better on people with broad shoulders like the models mine are kind of narrow plus crew necks arent the most flattering neckline on me i would say its fairly short just barely covering my belt so on taller people it may be cropped and the waist is kind of fitted as shown i love that its cotton mad
i love this top  it does run big and maybe some wont like it with the elastic waist  i think its the perfect weight and very comfortable  i love the detail around the neck line
i love this top the color is quite unique a reddish color but the cut really makes it stand out i love the square neckline i feel it accentuates my bust without showing too must breast i notice a number of other reviewers had an issue with the tightness around the bust this top looks like it would have ample stretch in the photograph however in person you can see that the embroidered area does not have any stretch for me this was not an issue as the top suited my body type well rega
i thought this would look great with skirts but all my skirts are too dressy for this tshirt thats really all it is  a nothingspecial tshirt and it runs so big im usually a large or xl in tops but for this one i bought a medium and its still too big i think a small would have been fine but as i mentioned it doesnt go with any of my skirts so its not worth looking for a small
i loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store particularly the muted red color the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me however part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired since i purchased during the sale im going to try and mend myself but this may end up having to go back if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged i would recommend it
i wasnt expecting this top to be so soft and comfortable and breezy i am usually an xs petite but based on reviews i got the regular small it is a little loose but the length is perfect i am short for reference   lb  the buttons gaped a very tiny bit like a centimeter but not to the point where any skin or bra was visible had i got the xsp i think the gaping would have been an issue the arms are too baggy for my taste length is ok though but i fold the sleeves up at th
i bought this top in slate it is very nice looks so flattering and good with a light pant it runs large though and is loose fitting like a swing top i like the design at the top i will try the mauve in the store i really like this top and recommend it for casual wear very comfortable and soft
cute basic top it has really great detail at the top and it is a good length it is not super longtoo short it does billow out a bit at the bottom so i would size down this is what i did after reading the previous reviews i do not think i would have paid full price for this top but on sale it is a great deal and a nice addition to your wardrobe
i am always looking for a shirt thats a little different yet as comfortable as a normal tshirt running after a  year old i need comfort i bought two colors and love the vibrant pinksalmon and the dark purple which i think it said was blue for some reason the material is nice and the cut is feminine
i love this shirt i ordered a large because i am taller and i wanted the length to be right while its a little baggy its still very flattering and ive received lots of compliments on it the color is exactly what is show in the image its a versatile shirt depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work dinner or a night out id definitely recommend this shirt to a friend
nice basic pencil skirt to have in the closet i think the fit is right on and did not have any problems with billowing like in the other review quality is nice but could be even better
the fit of the top is true to size but i really dont like the taupe terryclothlike sweatshirt under the white lace the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe it is terrible paired together i also didnt like the feel of the terryclothlike fabric against my skin even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail im absolutely sending it back
im   lbs and i ordered these in a size small i just got them in the mail and the print is really pretty and they seem very wellmade unfortunately they were a little too small particularly around my butt after i ordered them i read reviews on other merchants websites and saw that many other stores recommend sizing up as the brand is known to run small i wish i had known before i ordered but im exchanging them for a medium and i hope those fit better because this suit is ador
i saw this at the store today very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through from what i could see on my body it would have been too short in the crotch i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely i gave up cute shade of green though
i was lucky to get these on sale with free shippingmy major lucky shopping moment of the year however they are worth every penny of the full price ive waited years before shelling out this much for a pair of nice jeans but now my skeptical opinion has done a  turn these paige verdugo ultra skinny jeans are superior to any denim ive ever tried they look and feel fabulous on me i bought my usual   and am

these pants are cute they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly since they already run a bit big this is a major negative i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants
this was about to be my first retailer splurge item but i think im not there yet for the rich price tag these pants werent going to be versatile enough for me theyre very light weight and even translucent in sunlight perfect for a small subset of my days but not going to make the cut for casual friday that light patch near the r knee is also a pocket tended to flap open and look about as nonsensical as it is if youre already on this level good for you i had to send these back
ordered the biggest size available the large the arms are so tight i couldnt get it on looked like it may have fit in the body so i dont understand why so constricting in the arms i dont have big arms either fabric is thin but the color is pretty cant recommend id pass on this one
this jacket is high quality leather and will bring you years of wear i made sure to add a little room to accommodate thick sweaters
i purchased the blue s    and this was very large and boxy on me not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price the blue color is very pretty in persondarker and slightly marled however although this sweater is certainly cashmere and very soft because of it it is very thinto the point that i consider this a top rather than a sweater the silk panel in back is pretty but again thin and unlined i think that even on sale this is ov
these are just some classic around the house type socks theyre not comfortable enough to wear with some boots or anything just super snuggly and soft for lounging purposes only i love them and am contemplating buying the other pair i got the blue and white ones to go with the farrier tee in blue and white im kind of bummed that i cant wear these anywhere but no worries theyll be great with some joggers and a sweatshirt while i work the crossword over a cup of coffee would recommend
these jeans are super cozy  the material is so soft they feel like im wearing yoga pants the color has a little more depth than in the photo not just straight navy as it appears my only issue is because they are so soft they lose a little shape after worn all day love mother jeans
this socks are very comfortable however they do feel a little big around the top so for people with a small lower calf might find them a bit big that being said they are very comfortable
i cant stop rubbing the faux fur faux fur can be cheap and tacky but this looks and feels beautiful it has two hook and eyes and comes with a third which i used to add another hook on top above my bust its roomy so size down if you want it fitted im  and  with a  c bust and a short torso and i got a small i could have worn the xs but i like the fact that the small allows for a good weight cashmere sweater underneath without feeling tight the hood is the best part its so drama
this was my first mother denim purchase and ive already gotten another color love the feel of this denim its heavy enough to smooth out any imperfections and manages to stay tight not stretch out while being comfortable this color is perfect too so flattering love
dress is much different in person thin ribbed cotton  a little tight for xl    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos  returned and would not recommend
love this top it is almost universally flattering and washes beautifully it is as easy as throwing on a sweatshirt with leggings but soooo much better if you are on the fence on this one i highly recommend you give it a try
this jacket is so adorable on i have no idea why retailer styled it with a chunky cream turtleneck under it considering the jacket is also cream and its hard to tell what it even looks like ive been searching for a coat like this to give my leather jacket a break in my opinion a lot of the faux coats look like they have cheap itchy material this definitely does not it is super soft and the faux fur is of high quality the inside is also lined and feels like a very thick soft jersey sweater

i tried this shirt on in store and loved it it has a flattering fit and is very comfortable i read some other reviews about the quality not being good i dont feel that way at all the knit and the silkysatiny materials both feel like quality to me the one concern i have is that it may wrinkle easily im  and  and the xs fits well i plan to pair it with skinny jeans

i tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set the shirt was softer than i was expecting but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit there was some tightness in the armpit area which is not where i would have expected it to be tight the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i dont think a size up would have been a good option for me i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didnt fit it is between a lightwe

well i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one i think this top is very pretty yes it does hide any flaws in the tummy but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant side or front view i am  ft  inches broad shouldered  and the small fit nicely i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chestarm area the lace is pretty looks good worn with a dark colored pant the only

i highly recommend this dress i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static but nothing that a little static guard couldnt prevent  i purchased a medium petite and i am about  feet tall usually a size  in dresses and it fit perfect wore for thanksgiving the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk which i love
i only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it id recommend that you order up a size for that reason otherwise it is cute i am ordering the shorts to go with it
i own the green version of this jacket and ordered the ivory as well because of the sale price and because i loved the green one so much i highly recommend this jacket to wear over dresses with jeans or skirts all year round
i ordered this to go over a dress i wanted the jacket short to not cover the waist of the dress on sale i think it is a great bargain the sleeves are long on me but i rolled them which i thought was intended since they are lined the medium fit me i am usually an  in tops the ivory color is almost a pure white
"i love my new blazer the material is very soft and comfortable and very nice quality but not too wooly to wear into spring the cut is very flattering and the patterns and fringe details are very eyecatching i am  and usually wear a size s in retailer and this small fit perfectly they greycream color combo is gorgeous and looks very versatile and can be dressed up or downthe one alteration i suggest is moving the button at the shoulder it gives a wide boxy shape my tailor wil"

this is a nice shirt and very flattering the ivory is actually more of a tanbrown i would not call it ivory or off white the material has a nice texture to it as well it does run big and long so keep that in mind when purchasing
if your looking for a nice quality basic tee this is it nothing special but the fabric is a nice soft cotton with a little stretch the cut is long and lean so i would highly recommend sizing up i sized up from my usual medium to a large and its still quite form fitting im   bust  waist  hips
i love this tunic the detail the weight the fringe but it runs big i would have done better to have ordered one size smaller i think it would have looked more tailored if i had gotten the medium
after seeing the picture online i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened i immediately ordered it but im still not sure if im going to keep it i ordered a   was sold out and i was assuming it was going to be a little big but i like flowy the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back and its a bit longer in the back as well i feel like it looks like im wearing a wedding dress i love it from the front im going to try to
i ordered the red and am watching for my size in the green to come back into stock i was already expecting my bra straps to be exposed not a big deal as with shoulder length hair it covers them so i found this top to be exactly as pictureddescribed it fits like it looks on the model and i thought the color to be spot on i have washed it once in the washer on cold and dried only for a few minutes on low as i like to do with delicate knits to regain shape and i think it looks as good as it di
beautiful sweater unique knit mix and i love the color but the fabric is too itchy i was wearing a long sleeve dress underneath but the yarn was prickling my arms bum and thighs  colorblock patchwork arrangement made me look extra top hefty and emphasized my trouble spots upper backarms  i ordered lp but it was too large so would recommend staying tts
i have too many grey cardigans i also have a lot of oversized cardis but i had to have this one because the stitch pattern is so nice and the yarns are so soft and snuggly how could i resist the weave is a bit open work but it still keeps me warm  happy it also lays in a way that doesnt make me look bulky and top heavy which my body type already is i feel sorry for the first reviewer who kept getting subpar sweaters mine arrived brand new in factory cellophane i would advise that this

adorable  unique swtr  wld go w many things note that  front pocket is slightly higher than the other looks that way in the pic too its the retailer unique touch i dont mind abt that its too itchy for me i ordered the sp to have shorter armsfell just above my knuckles which is fine i have many tnecks to wear under it but i decided i really didnt need another itchy swtr so returned no worry retailer has plenty of other items of interest
highly recommend this top received lots of compliments on the day that i wore recommend wearing with a tank top

this is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric i loved the colors and the design i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester and it is but it feels like chiffon the only two complaints i have are  the dress is large so go a size smaller than you would normally and  this is dry clean only if this is polyester why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned oth
i ordered two colors and was happy with them both  i wear tanks under many tops in the warm weather as so many are sheer  i like a layered look and having layers to peel as needed  these tops are great on their own as well  i recommend them to anyone wanting swing and extra length  really love the fabric too
i wanted to like this top as the fabric was nice and thick but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape but ive always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy and im not heavy not great enough to keep in my opinion
missed these last year in black so snatched them up when i saw them this season greatversatile wardrobe piece  dress them up or down with kneehi boots booties or great heeled pump with silk blouse or sweater love something that i can wear so many ways and look and feel polished and put together
these are as comfortable as any other leggings they are thick enough that they are not see through such a pet peeve when i see people with see through leggings the front panel is so soft and i feel like it gives more of a professional vibe they are a bit croppedshort but im tall so im used to this
this is a great top and it fit me very nicely but its much longer than it appear to be in the picture im  and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples im sure if youre very tall i think you will love it
i bought the white in a m one size down from my normal i could have gone with a s given the swingy shape and forgiving nature of the linen it is very light and comfortable the length is a tunic on me at  so keep that in mind if you dry it in the dryer it will shrink for sure i never recommend drying linen knits in the dryer because they will likely develop holes i love this tank and will probably buy another color or two if they get black or grey i will def buy another one

i got this shirt in stores because it went on sale i was excited to wear it but it felt a little long on me i decided that after a regular wash it would help it after washing it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowyness its a classic shirt but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric be careful when washing
this top is overall very flattering i am petite but large chested and the small fits great in the front although it bunches a little bit in the back where the tag is  i think because of the crossing straps but nothing that will gender me from wearing it i got the pink and i do wish it were a little more pink  its so light that it almost looks white overall i am happy with this sale purchase
this dress is so much more stunning in person than in the photos its incredibly flattering and i like how it pans out at the bottom it also has pockets although it has a builtin slip it is a little seethrough so keep that in mind otherwise i cant wear it enough
i bought the red and white both tank tops were a nice thick material definitely high quality i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom just enough to be loose and flattering but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity but i think itd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops it runs a touch big im normally between a small and an xs and the xs was not even
"this is a beautiful long midi blazer that happens to feel like a sweatshirt buy it youll look super classy and put together i wear to work and going out ive been noted to also curl up in bed wearing this because its so comfortable and i forgot to switch into a sweatshirt note im on the short side so the blazer ends up being a little longer for me i happen to like it because it gives it a little more formalness of a longer coat while still being spring weight jerseyterry on the"
so disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days especially at this price point the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful but i will never spend two hundred dollars or even half that on a poly dress please add more linen cotton and silk
"i love tracy reese this skirt did not disappoint i saw it originally in store  fell in love i waited to see if it would go on sale and it didi put on the size   it fit gorgeously the fabric is a bit stiff and bulky but i think thats so it holds its shape first thing i went into my living room  began twirling aroundi am   athletic build the sizing is true to tracy reese ill need to get the skirt hemmed as its quite long on me but this little gem will be worn"
the front of these is the leather looking material the back is just a stretchy material they are comfortable but they run very small i consistently wear a  in this brand i purchased that size but could barely get them up definitely size up i had to exchange they are cute but im not sure they are worth full price the quality is mediocre and i think you can buy faux leather pants for less at another store
i debating this dress for a long time i just was hesitant because it is very form fitting i think this dress runs true to size after reading other reviews i was debating ordering a  im normally an  and i am glad i went with the  it is form fitting the material is just absolutely beautiful and not stiff it is a bit thicker which will be nice in the fall colors are true to the pictures shown and length falls as shown on model
so versatile and comfortable i plan adding this into my rotation year round under a jacket or cardigan during the colder months if you prefer baggier fit i would suggest going up a size
this really is a gorgeous jacket i would give it  stars just because sometimes it can be a bit unflattering in the tummy area poofs out a bit at certain times but i had to remind myself that is the style of the coat i am petite and curvy on bottom so this could just be me tried wearing with a skinny belt and it looked cute i think i will try both ways seems very warm beautful colors and the material is soft and not itchy at all excited because versatile for everyday wear but also l
this dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip areaso that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didnt feel comfortable about some darts could have made a nicer fit here but this is a a great dress if you dont mind a super body con fit

i ordered this dress with great expectations after coveting one in a store but unfortunately it did not work for me the fabric is a stretch cotton jacquard which is absolutely beautiful and the colors are gorgeous i do not think it runs big i sized up and it still fit me like a sausage casing if you are tall and thin with no bulges this dress is for you
i love the pure and good short sleeve tees they feel beautiful and wash beautifully i just hang them to dry and they are perfect for the next time i buy a size medium as i like them to flow nicely at the hips
i just bought this adorable top in the black motif and was surprised by how good it looked it runs tts  and got it in my usual size small its very soft the print is so cute the arm openings arent too big and the length is just like on the model not too long or short i think its even cuter in person and i like the price point a very sweet top so worth a try
i really like the red version of this shirt it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace for the weekend i am  lbs a  chest and the small fit me perfectly
this top is beautiful in both colors it was a difficult decision at the store i went with the black and my usual size s fit well with a little room but in no way overly baggy i tried on the xs which also fit but was a little constricting the quality is excellent and i highly recommend this top  question i have however is that the online description says machine wash however my tag states dry clean only just curious if anyone has hand washed this yet otherwise it is a beautiful comf
i love this maxi dress it is fitted up top and very maxi like on the bottom it was to much fabric for me the dress made me look heavier than i am i am  and  i fit in the medium the dress just didnt do anything for my body type  curvy i think you need to be fairly lean to look nice in this dress sadly i had to return maeve makes great maxis unfortunately they dont fit me correctly
this dress is simply gorgeous the slit is just right the colors are great and most of all the fabric is very comfy i highly recommend
i bought this to wear for my baby shower at  weeks i was able to buy it in my size and still get a great fit and the skirt hits right at my bump with the band just above it great option for expecting mothers that can be worn after baby the top is also snug enough to feel like it covers properly could be too snug if you are large chested though
"the colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cutfor reference i am     the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts or if you dont mind some cleavage showing this length was also a bit too long so if you are  or shorter you may want to order the petite size"
you cant exactly tell from the picture but this dress has a skirt that bubbles a little at the bottom and it really adds interest to the whole piece i think my favorite part about this dress though is the weightiness of the skirtits not so heavy that its hot or uncomfortable but enough that it feels more quality more special
"the cut is lovely and the fabric is wonderfulits a little thicker than you might think so it felt a little warmi am sending back as i have a little belly and it doesnt hide muchbut it did make my boobs look awesome"
i love this dress picked one up in store at  offeven better im   and  and i did find the waist runs a bit wide because im tall i think the length was a plus but a shorter person would definitely want to go with a petite i usually wear an  but bought a  in this dress so i think it runs a tad large the fabric is weighty enough to hide minor lumps and bumps but ill be wearing shapewear anyway the pattern is perfectly aligned just like the online images and

this just arrived today the material is very soft and i love the olive color it has a zipper in the back but i was able to easily slip this over my head making me think it runs a bit large because it is loose the fact that the drop waist hits right at the hip doesnt bother me though i thought it would fall a little lower i am only  and i consider this to be a short dress with thick leggings i think it will be great winter dress the bodice is fully lined the skirt is not and the ne

this is instantly one of my favorite dresses but please note it runs large size down i am  and regularly a size  i tried both of those sizes on in store and picked the  it was perfectly form fitted and the perfect length when i got home i realized i had been reading the uk sizes on the tag and really bought a size  no idea how it fit me i have never purchased a size  in my life i am adding a photo so potential customers can see what it looks like on an average sized person 
"alas i so wanted to love this the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous  flowy drapey ultimate grecian goddess but it just doesnt work unless youre superskinny too much material almost bulky strange looking the print is so beautiful  i love the pink floral and i love the whole idea of the dress but it just doesnt work have to send it back im   pounds  and i ordered a "
i have  pairs of these chinos i love them so much they come soft like a wellworn favorite but are high quality at a great price im typically a size  i bought the  size but think i could have gone down to a  otherwise very happy with this purchase
on me this was not good at all couldnt get it off fast enough the thick stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly and im a size  also the color is a dark brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive
i adore this dress i wantedneeded to add a few velvet pieces to my wardrobe and when i saw this online i decided this had to be one of them im  and  pounds and ordered the xsmall and it fits me perfectly the color is so rich and the details are delicate understated and yet striking i intend to wear this for a variety of occasions
"the attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brandi tried a size  and it fit fine just above my long waist   currently  with narrow hips and fuller thighs i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes  and  depending on my weight and these fit similarly i think the size  petite would be a bit lower but its sold out nowthe only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s"
picked this up at the local retailer in both colors the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan  which i also bought highly recommend
just bought this top in the black at my local retailer and i love it it fits well not too large and tenty it actually fit me under the arms too usually retailer tops tend to run huge not this one i love that it is easy to layer with a long boyfriend cardi or a more structured jacket im   pounds and took the xs i would definitely recommend this top
this sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on i dont usually pay this much for a cardigan but the quality and feel are better than usual
these pants are the perfect weight and comfort they are cozy enough to wear around the house and sleep in as well i highly recommend these dreamy pants
the picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color it looks great on and the colors compliment each other i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe
"i really loved the way this shirt looked on me its forgiving and flattering and really lightweight the fabric however couldnt even withstand half a days wear without snagging  times and developing a hole right in the center i have no idea how this happened as i wasnt wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it such a shame this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me"
definitely agree with the other reviewers this top looks great on the model but pretty bad in real life super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs if you plan on ordering id recommend sizing down
i have been thinking about getting this dress for a while but was holding out because i was concerned it would look like a sack but i am so glad i got it and so glad my usual size was not available typically im a m or a m petite but i ordered this in a s petite while still flowy i think it would have been overwhelming in my usual size i think it will be great for many occasions as the solid black can be dressed up or down i cant wait to wear it definitely consider sizing down

this shirt is as cute on as it looks in the pictures i love the fit and felt great in it on a moms night out with jeans and heals i also think it could be dressed up for work or further down for a day out and about love it
i think this is going to be a love or hate top i love it it is see through requiring an under top however the fabric is extremely light weight and the style is floaty so a simple lightweight tankcami will look pretty showing through in a number of colors i bought the offwhite it is meant to be a full fit but i think going down one size will help especially since the photos dont show just how full the back really is the fabric will probably snag easily still i just really like the sty

this top is really comfortable and the details make it easy to add interest to an outfit i was worried all the details together would be a bit overwhelming but it works i wish the design was on the back as well but its fine the material is a nice light weight but the pleats do fold up a little after washing so ironing is required
very flatttering skirt  super cute  highly recommend 
"this is a highquality swimsuit that can be worn inside out easy to wear colors fantastic pattern placement the other side is an intense blue i would suggest going by the size chart on the mara hoffman site  i think this should look great on athletic figures the back is lowcut and the bottom has medium coverage not as skimpy as brazilian cut bottoms not ideal for hourglass figures as there is no bust support and you will show quite a bit from the side it is cut in at the front w"

i really liked this top but it was very expensive even when on sale and it ended up being boxy i am flatchested   if i remember correctly i tried on the xs it was cute but it wasnt flattering because it was so boxy on my frame perhaps itd be more flattering on other body shapes i think it would be cuter if it was a bit more fitted otherwise the quality seemed great though id be worried about all the beading falling off eventually
i purchased the white in the store in a size   i ordered the black online in a  and the lining was a bit snug i can maybe remove the black lining however i really like how the peplum looks the v neck and bra friendly design are a perfect marriage i see wearing these through the fall with a denim jacket or cardigan for now i am enjoying how floaty and feminine i feel i think this is a perfect top for women with a larger chest as it gives a nice shape but doesnt look maternity or b

i just bought this dress today and it is absolutely stunning it looks so much better in person than on the model i think it runs true to size however it does have relaxed fit overall the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow without adding bulk great buy
i loved this dress online however i did not love it on me it was a bit snug in the waist and bust i usually order a  or  but got the dress in a  i thought i would love the mid length but it felt awkward on me im  i think its a beautiful dress just didnt work for me
i got the brown one and im very please with the softness of the thread and the light weight feel of the fabric
love this tank the cotton is very soft which also allows some flow ive worn this to yoga and to teach barre and cardio dance and its a hit as a lifelong dancer this was a must have my only negative is since the sizing is either xss or ml it may run too big or too small for some i tyically wear a m or  in retailer tops and this is a little large in ml however not to the point of being distracted with straps falling or the like highly recommend
this is a cute sweater i agree that its slightly boxy partly because of the side pockets which i think are cute the yellow is darker than it appears on my screen more like a mustardygold which is not great on my skin tone i think its true to size i got my usual retailer size xspetite im   waist and it fits just right its soft and a nice medium weight on the packaging it was called a bomber so id say it is cut a little like a bomber jacket

"cute dress i say true to size  but keep in mind it is loose and flowy and i purchased in my usual size medium and it fits perfectly its lined so there is no need for a slip very comfortable and cool i am  and it is  above knee i paired it with the gemline lariat turquoise necklace and have already received several compliments and my day is only  overa great priced dress which holds true to retailers quality and uniqueness of items offered"
love this sweater it is easy to wear and goes well with multiple outfits it is a great flexible add to my wardrobe it fits well even in the sleeves
this dress was huge im normally an extra small and i was swimming in it the xxs was sold out but i think it would of been huge as well
these leggings are gorgeous soft suede feel perfect fit great look especially for dressing up and going out love them
the most amazingly versatile cardi youll ever own it goes with everything from boyfriend jeans and booties to black chiffon pleated skirt its soft and feminine and makes you feel like you look like a million dollars definitely worth the price
this is a beautiful top which runs tts and armholes are not too big for once i typically struggle with armholes being way too big on me and have to size down in most tops and this top runs tts and armholes are perfect no bra showing beneath yay it is a beautiful color and design just love it i am a typical size  and size  was perfect i am  and no problems in bust area works well with my short torso highly recommend i think it will look great on all body types

its not as form fitting  hourglass shaped in real life as on the model i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy otherwise its nice
when i wore this the two times i did i got a ton of compliments it runs small and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning after the second wear the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable i have to return it and am so disappointed sadly i would not recommend buying it for that reason
this sweater caught my eye months ago and i recently picked it up on sale at a great price it reminds me of something betty draper would wear on mad men it has a fabulous  feel to it and everyone loves pockets i love the combination of peachy pink and cream and the sweater it quite warm the fit is good although on me the buttons gap slightly this is easily remedied by wearing a shirt underneath as shown on the model im already dreaming up lots of fun outfit combinations
"this has a wonderful texture and feel to it the leather dots are supple and the tulle is soft and flowey its long more like a midi skirt and the color is more towards taupe than ivorywith a shimmer this skirt is very fun to wear"
i bought this for a wedding i will attend  months from now when i saw this dress on sale i just need to get it it was simply gorgeous it fitted so well it makes one feel so special i like the addition of the belt
"what a huge dissippointment when this arrived homethe sleeves are very long and very boxyi have no idea the condition of this on store but came with damages on sleeves also we can tell that was something wrong and i was surprise that retailer sent me something like that im a customer here for a very long timedissipointed "
im  about  and usually a  in retailer the size  in this skirt fit at my natural waist perfectly with enough room to move comfortably on the hanger and from the photo i didnt think id like it but once on its really pretty and the fabric looks so nice it has great movement and is really flattering
the purplecobalt is a beautiful color i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price
this shirt is a great way to rock the off the shoulder trend you can dress it up or down bi would definitely recommend it

ordered these pants in an xs    they fit well in the waist but are quite long so i roll the waist band down once they are super fun  funky  i mainly plan to wear them around my house so i dont mind rolling the waist band if i were going to wear them out id probably have to pair with heels as they are a few inches too long light  airy material perfect for summer  cute detail on the pocket seams too
i first saw this shirt online and decided to see it in person so happy i did i never would have picked it up in the store it looks much better on than on the hanger it is so flattering you can wear it on or off the shoulders and although it is a boxy shirt it somehow makes you look slim wow i took my usual medium highly recommend
i ordered this dress to wear to a mid summer evening wedding i love it i think it will be fun and it is unexpected for me i will need to order a smaller sizei am  and almost always wear a  in retailer wear this ran a little big on the top i will be ordering a  and sending one back
i think the fabric is very nice and soft i find this top runs very large i am   normally wear a small in a shirt i should have ordered xs it is very large i actually looked to see if they sent me the wrong size the shoulder area fits fine i may try tucking it in other than size a nice top
"im not sure why they call this black because what you see in this pictures depicted is pretty much the shade in person the fabric itself is lovely it made my wider hips look smaller pros drapes beautifully on the body especially for curvier gals not black but a deep navyvelvet look and feel very forgiving and stretchy perfect length in front and back hides imperfections wonderfully soft flows well and uniquecons material is thin not for winter a"
even on sale i was hesitant about paying so much for a blouse but im so happy i did the fabric looks as high quality inperson as it does in the picture and it isnt seethrough the main color of the top is less powder pink and more nude in my opinion but the color is lovely and the various purples and grays of the arrow details really pop the buttons down the back are a fun cute detail and tone down the more professional look of this blouse in order to wear it with jeans for going out
these pants are extremely comfortable and flattering i bought them in coral and wore with a black peasant top sandals and a long necklace they do stretch out a lot though so i would recommend sizing down i bought mine to look like they fit on the model and after a few hours they were hanging off of me so buy them a little bit tighter than you like the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist
love these pants i bought them in two colors flattering fitting im    hip i bought these in size  sometimes i dont like petit sizing but these petite at  long inseam still gave me enough length to wear with heals there is the usual good and bad with linen  after you wear them once you need to iron because they look too wrinkled and worn the linen is light and washed  unfortunately i dont think these pants will hold up for more than a two years ill love them while i
"just received this dress today i bought it for a vacation we are taking to mexico i wanted a nice coverupthis is beautiful fits nicely without looking like a tenti would highly recommend this is one size fits all"
absolutely love this dress maeve dresses have always been constructed with great care and quality i am and always have been a size med in maeve dresses the dress is soft and flowing the fabric is very forgiving and moves with you i recommend trying on a dress by this maker    their cuts are consistent so i feel extremely confident in buying their clothes online this is a keeper and can be worn year round

i see all the amazing reviews and on one hand i agree with them but these pants do run huge and they dont fit tailored like on the model on me they fit loose around the legs and thighs and theyre super wrinkly youll have to iron these after every wear and every wash im surprised to see the comment saying theyre wrinkle resistant they arent also the kahki is more grey which i dont love i got these on sale but even at  i just cant justify keeping them theyre super comfy but
this is a super cute rompervery casual very comfortable i feel it runs a bit big because i tried on an xs im usually a small  it fit perfectly except for the inseam on the legs i am   tall but mostly legs as opposed to being long waisted i wear a  inseam with flats if the bottom of the legs were not elasticized i could have just gone with a cropped look or rolled them etc but the elastic was digging into my calves after just five minutes i think it might be very unco

i just tried this top on in xs regular even though i generally wear xspetite in retailer and it fit great      i think its flattering on my fairly straight body with the halter neck fitted waist and peplum i would guess it would be flattering on many body types it highlights shoulders beautifully it was very hard to get my head through the small nottoostretchy opening so you may want to try it on without makeup i knocked off one star because the neck band wasnt symmetrical
"i am so happy with this jumpsuit it is the perfect comfortable and casual summer outfit the fabric is super soft i was unsure about the length at first because its shorter than my other jumpsuits but if you scrunch up the bottom of the legs and add some sandals its a great look highly recommend"

this jumpsuit is so so cute i tried it on in an xs in store but needed a petite i ordered the xsp online received it but honestly its still a little big the xxsp is sold out but i love the piece so much i think im going to have it taken in trust me its just as cute as it looks if not cuter
i love this sweater love the length its a bit loose and delicate compared to what i usually wear but looks great with boots and leggings love the sheer fabric across the bottom of the back the loose bows on the sides and the drape of the fabric all combine to make a great sweater runs true to size has a loose fit but you dont feel like you are drowning in fabric like some loose fitting cardigans
the prints are very cute and flattering and the material is thick im   and  and got the xsp my usual size the shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly the neckline is a little low questionable for work the fit however is off on the waist  which is not as pictured it is more of an empire waist ad barely even clears my boobs so i doubt even a regular xs will change this much it isnt a flattering look on my frame altho the prints hide it somewhat except from the side view also
im a big fan of level  jeans and linen pants these are great good quality flattering fit lovely color i got the coral in size  and that works for me they do start out just a bit snug in the seat when i first put them on but theyll pretty quickly stretch out just enough to maintain shape without becoming baggy like my other level  linens something to keep in mind when trying to find your right fit i was a little worried that the drawstring meant there wouldnt be much
purchased these recently and loved the fit and feel upon trying them on i was hoping that unlike linen pants theyd keep their shape no such luck after an hour or two in them they were hanging and sagging this is after being a good snug fit i purchased my usual size and id say they stretched at least a size or two bigger the color and feel of these is very nice and i see them being perfect for a very casual or slightly dressier outfit so i do recommend them however buy them small bec

i vacillate betwixt saying this shirt runs large and small i usually wear a small in retailer items but the xs was all that was left in the charming bee print the fit is flattering even though its smaller than my usual size conclusion runs large however when i went to put my head through the top of the shirt it was like being birthed conclusion runs small bottom line im in love with this shirt and so ill just have to get used to the faux birthing feeling every time i put it o

i was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the other reviews but so glad i did i usually wear a  and the  fit great it feels like high quality and i think the shirt will work well for both work and casual events i have a long torso and dont find it too short at all it is a tad tight across the shoulders so if you are broad in that area it might not work for you overall love
ok so yes it is true that the top part where the sleeves are can be snug a little especially if you work out but overall i found the top to run true to my regular size i only tried on the  didnt try bigger the length was great for me being short i didnt think i need the petite i usually do for pants and skirtsdresses tops on and off the look of the shirt is also classic flowy and it looked great with e half tuck the embroidery is also nice though one part of it seemed loose a
love this swimsuit runs true to size definitely recommend very flattering for reference i have a straightathletic build im    and size  was great for top and bottom
i love this top so much i tried it on twice because i forgot why it didnt work the first time i have a chest im just a c cup but i looked lumpy and matronly in this top if thats not an issue for you i think youll love it
i love this dress its an unusual material and really adorable in person the problem was that it runs so large that i couldnt make it work im usually an xs regular the xs swallowed me so then i ordered it in a pxs and pxxs because i really wanted it to work only the pxxs fit but it was so short that there was no way i could make it work and im only  i am  years old so i am not comfortable wearing ultra short dresses maybe a person who doesnt mind really short would be able to
"usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work  im a  and itwas way too small in the chest area  it is a beautiful shirt though and im very sad that i have to return it  it will work better on someone else for sure  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine"
this dress is super super pretty it is very dull light blue grey very romantic with the black blow very very pretty i love it my only complaint is that it balloons up a bit due to the fabric it is very fitted for me i think if it were a tad loose fitting it would not balloon up around the curves as much it is short and comes a little above the knees i love this dress for its romantic look it can be paired with leggings as wellcant wait to wear it
softest cardigan ive had in a long time fits a little bit on the large side especially in the sleeve length but who doesnt love a big cozy sweater this is a great way to add some color to any fall outfit highly recommend this one all i wish is that it came in more colors

i love this tank it is casual and comfortable but has the little scarf attached to it so sweet and styling i tried on the xs regular and would need petite it was a bit long on me but some people may prefer that i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looserfit tank both colors are nice and neutral good piece to add to a transition wardrobe  lbs  dd  in waist
i love the idea of this shirt but the execution is absolutely horrible i ordered online and what i received is just a mess the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread not just a few hanging off but literally big clumps a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside the fit is just as big a mess i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
i bought this during the  off and im glad i did the sweater does run large so i would recommend sizing down im   lbs with a larger bust  and even the size small is large on me not large enough to exchange but i would probably do better with an xs even with an xs i would still get that oversized look the color is not exactly as pictured it is a brighter yellow in person i was expecting more of a muted soft baby yellow and thats not exactly what this is some pros a
this jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture color is very close too i normally wear a  top sometimes s sometimes m the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms  the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back i love this jacket though the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it
i love this sweater jacket found it on the sale rack in a medium and fits like a medium would fit from my adored retailer i am  inches and  chest and curvy  lbs the knitted detailed collar is a show stopper and what makes this item look like an an old school retailer item the color is really not orange but more of a vintage rose with hints of rust and soft shades of pink i love this color and i think it would look beautiful on many skin tones i paired it with a pink blouse from anth
this is way shinier in person than i expected but i like it there are gold threads throughout which stand out i love shiny things so i was pleasantly surprised i agree that you could size down if you wanted but it looks cute roomy and loose i think really soft i will wear this to the park or dressed up for dinner love the double duty aspect im a little bummed about the fabric content but thats it
this cardigan is a beautiful  not too thin but soft and versatile the cutouts add a nice unique detail i was worried that the cuts might fray but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices 
love the fit and feel of the fabric says to dry but i found the leg seams did bunch up a bit so next time i wont dry them ill hang to dry very cute style super comfy
"the model pose does not do this dress justice it is super flattering and the fabric is a thick light fabric cant explain it the pattern is simply adorable i cant figure out why this one is on sale while other colors arent as in my opinion this is the nicest onefits true to size as in my lower range i tried on both pettie and regular and went with regular petite was too short for me i went with size  and am  and weight about "
i ordered these for store pick up and loved the color red ones the fit in petite ws nice and flattering but iwould have to wear them with ehels still th reason i didnt keep them is perhpas the pocket placement in front didnt flatter me as well i think maybe i will order when on sale or find a similar style with different frnt pockets
this cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years agoi have this cardigan and have loved wearing it i think it only came in cream color unfortunately i caught the cutouts a few times and the cutouts are slightly ripped in  spotsnot very noticeable but i know theyre there so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan this time from meadow rue i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size smalli am usually a s
this dress is so much better in person i would say it is tts but it was oddly baggy around the chestarmpit area which didnt deter me from keeping it the biggest negative i have is that it is rayon but i dont think thatll change with retailers anytime soon
i bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large i loved the feel color grey and style of the dress but i ended up returning it because of the fit it also requires something under it since it is fairly seethrough
got this in the blue and was so excited while it looks cute someone had clearly bought this worn it and returned it it had human and dog hair all over it not to mention some kind of red strings it was pilling all over so much for quality control i dont mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount
this sweater is gorgeousit is of great quality and very warm i was very excited and wanted it to look great howeveri have a large bust and am full figuredso it was not appealing and just kind of hung there i feel that it would look great on thinner womenand it is a gorgeous sweaterjust not for me
this blouse is stunning its ultra feminine but has a bit of bohemian feel to it i am  and  pounds i ordered an xs at first in both colors but they were a little big in the bust area and under the arms my bust size is  i ordered the xxs in both sizes not petite as i have a longer torso and they fit perfectly they are not too snug anywhere and it makes the blouse look even better  obviously  because it fits better the hem of the shirt in a size xxs hits right below the hip b
i saw this in the store and immediately had to try it on it fits perfectly im usually a size  with dresses and the small fit perfectly it looks expensive and high quality and the print is unique what i love most about it is that i can wear it in the winter time layered over say a black turtle neck and black tights but i think it can also be worn in the spring especially with that flower print
i love love these wide leg pants the embroidery detail give them a little something extra special they are comfortable and perfect the length is great for wedges and the fold over waist does not add bulk the only downside and this is probably due to my figure but the pockets do need to be sewn shut so that they will lie flat
"i was on the fence about this dress  i wanted something nice but casual for a family graduation im glad i took the chance once it went on sale the fabric is not as thick as youd expect for a sweater just thick enough to hide any imperfections panty lines etc i plan to layer with long sleeved tees or a jean jacket i think it will do great through fall with tights and a turtleneckim   lbs  and the small fit perfectly i am pear  shaped by conventional standards bu"
i absolutely love this top i managed to snag one that had been returned to a store so i didnt have to order it i love the cute and the overall boho feel to it i feel like its true to size as im normally a medium in retailer

this is an adorable dress medium weight i highly recommend
i love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in i am petite but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee this dress is much shorter than stated and much shorter than it looks on the model i measured the petite xxs my normal size and it is  from the shoulder seam to the hem not  as stated five inches is a big discrepancy the color and style were lovely but i just cant
i stalked this blouse and when the price dropped i pounced on the black sadly it did nothing for me im a large sometimes medium but decided on the large youd think it came with its own cami at this price but no completely sheer unwearable without one the lace is nothing special the collar is wider in the back uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front the highlow hem fit me oddly in the back im returning this one
i love love love the soft fabric and the cozy cowl however mine not only had a giant hole it seemed like the yarn started pilling as soon as i touched it love the idea but not practical even without a hole 
this bikini bottom is great design and quality but runs small overall i would recommend
the colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected which is actually a plus in my opinion so i was very happy when i opened the package unfortunately the fit was off for me the lower part and the back are perfect the dress hangs nicely no puffing no stiffness however the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy i promise i usually dont have this problem i am  and routinely order xs the
i adored this when i saw it online paired with the leather skirt i waisted impatiently for it to show up and when it did was happy at the price point but unsure of how it would feel for the cut i would say it runs tts i am sometimes an xxs but in this case that size was tight across the shoulders i am worried that the xs will be too roomy in the waist but time will tell as for quality well you can feel the polyester in it for sure its nice to have the lining but i would not say it

i love love love this skirt its comfortable and attention getting i receive compliments whenever i wear it  and i feel great wearing it colors are much more vivid than on the website  thats a plus
these pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public they are good quality and fit nicely but i feel like if youre over  theyre not really flattering or especially appropriate
i got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it i felt it ran a little big im a  and usually have to wear a medium due to the girls but a small fit me and fit well i didnt find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders i paid full price but i loved it so much i didnt mind the sale price is amazing
loved the material and the feel however it does run a bit large on the shoulders so i had to return
my hearts aflutter for this top the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it and the little fluttery cap sleeves are to die for ive ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt especially in green and the double stripe jacquard skirt but im certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt its so flattering and comfortable with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le
its a lovely pattern on a soft tee the fit is similar to how it looks on the model not clingy at all it should be noted that its fairly seethrough if i wear a bra thats close to skin color its not an issue but it is obvious if youre wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra i suppose you could wear a cami underneath but its too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a tshirt overall im very happy with this though im also very very happy i got thi
i loved this tshirt i got the grey one in small im a size  and  it is a relaxed fit i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair i didnt want t plan t shirt but i also didnt want anything too crazy fits well and is soft too
although  i want to support usa products and am so glad retailer continues to add these options i also decided to splurge with family coming home for the holidays a way to stay in pajamas but still look dressed i am only  and these were just longer than capri length more like the closeup view online to get them ankle length you would have to push them way down on your hips not sure how the tall model did that i am  lbs and considered exchanging the xs for an s these run

the tee is adorable in the floral print the fit is true to size as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail i would have bought this at full price but it is quite see through in the whiteyellow floral i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute casual tee you can just throw on i was so disappointed that it was so sheer i think the
"i have a closet filled with black lace dresses but this one is my new favoritethe style is classic with an unexpected yet still elegant twisti ordered my usual size and found it to run a little on the small side especially in the waistthis is one dress you need to have in your closetif you are in between sizes i would suggest going up one size"
i tried on about  items in the store today and didnt buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral tshirt i may have to go back for it the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt the fit is exceptional as well not too loose or too snug i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price
i love everything about this skirt except that it adds bulk to the waist andor hip area because of lots of fabric and pleating   i still love it and when i place the waist band higher on my waist looks super cute with a dainty blouse tucked in   im   and have a tiny belly  pooch that comes and goes through out the day so although this skirt is beautiful it tends to magnify the tiniest of belly pooches and hips  i think i love the skirt too much to retun
i bought the grey version of this shirt instore because of the cute pattern soft material and versatility of wear you can dress it up for work or wear with jeansshorts for a more casual look the beautiful purples greens and blues of the roses look like a water color painting and stand out against the grey background ive already received multiple complements from coworkers and friends and liked it so much myself i bought the other two colors personally i think it runs a bit large s
love the fit feel and colors of this tee looks great with white jeans blue jeans and is so springy longer in length than most tees which is a plus for me may run a tad small since i am usually an xs in most tops but i bought a s and love the fit
i love tshirts by t la but unfortunately this particular one was different the sizing was off it ran small although i ordered my usual size medium for this brand i think the shirt is cute though
 months pregnant with twins and i prefer to buy regular clothes that can be worn post pregnancy as well as when pregnant went to a dr apt and the receptionist loved this shirt i told her it was nonmaternity and she can buy it at retailer i think she stopped by on her way home from work
i purchased this towards the end of winter because it reminded me of spring time it is such a lovely soft tee with a delicate flower design i wear it with jeans it always makes me feel happy
these shorts are wonderful very stylish and easy to pair with my tops they do run a bit large i am normally a size  or  i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small they are machine washable though and im not sure if they will shrink at all so im keeping them i would definitely recommend them
"i got this piece because it was so unique thats one of the things i love so much about retailer not afraid to go where no woman has gone before so i ordered it in a  my usual size and a  i am petite but the  worked perfectly i think i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the  was too small all over  so i would agree that it runs smallthe quality is excellent the look is great my husband liked it on me it might work for the office with so"
i bought this at the store and when i picked it up i didnt think much of it until i tried it on it is so adorable i cant even tell you how much i am  yo and normaly buy xss or  in retailer mauve dresses are  most of the time small chest  and about  and i got the size  and it is perfect i hope it is age appropriate tho  i have traveling plans this summer and i am thinking this could be an easy thing to take along with me one piece clothing that will travel very we
i absolutely love this sweater it is a beautiful deep blue color i love the unique cuff on the sleeves i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it
i was immediately drawn to this tunic at the store it has my favorite colors in it blue and orange as one reviewer said the print is eyecatching the feel of the material is soft i am  tall so it fits on me like a dress although if you are a taller person the slits on the side may be higher on the frame this is definitely one of my favorite tunics now
i love the design and color of this cardigan and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away but unfortunately its huge and shapeless i tried size xss and im a waif    i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height itll hang down somewhere midthigh or even lower you can snug up the ties as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel
i really like the soft flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress i am   the s was too large so i ordered the xs instead things to note pockets elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides slip underneath and large flutter sleeves i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing
the fit on these is good for my hourglass shape and the fabric quality and comfort is good tooi think the rinse is just not as nice in person the orange stitching is pretty bright too i bought a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these i am going to return these and see if they have something better  but will only buy in store from now on
im calling this the gateway jumpsuit for all those ladies who are wondering about this whole jumpsuit trend and how they feel about ityou know who you are this jumper is flattering comfortable elevatedand worth trying on im petite but longwaisted with curves on the bottom which can be a tough combo when trying to find a jumper i actually ordered the petite  first which was better fitting in the waist area but i ended up ultimately purchasing the regular  since i preferred where
ive been looking for a black offtheshoulder dress and found this baby in store today for reference i am    and took a small this dress is a shiftswing style so if youre looking for something fitted this isnt your dress as another reviewer mentioned ladies who are busty may not like this as the ruffle at the top could add unwanted volume if you are extremely thin or petite i might size down but i like my clothing loose vs fitted so i kept the small the fabric is g
got these on saleabsolutely love eberjey fabric is super soft and easy to wash more normal than other eberjey styles not lingerie im   lbs and small fit well i am small busted and there is definitely extra room but doesnt make it fit weird at all highly recommend
"i really wanted to love this dress but unfortunately the length of the ruffle up top is not flattering on someone with a large chest if you are d or smaller it will probably be perfect great material color and feel so bummed i had to return it"
i bought the stained glass topbottoms the print is very pretty however the tankini top itself is not wellmade the front of it chest area turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit which is white it doesnt lay flat around the top and so it shows more of your chest on one side for the price i dont think it is worth it i dont like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable

as other reviewers have mentioned this dress runs extremely large im a solid medium in maeve dresses usually and got this dress in the store in a size xsmall and took it to my local seamstress to get it taken in i get that this is supposed to be a swingy and airy dress but there was just too much space and material for me i loved the top and the soft material so i am ok with spending money to get the waist taken in i think this would be the perfect dress for someone with a slim fig
i bought the mosaic pattern in a small the pattern and colors look much better in person the design and quality are solid the top runs small it is difficult to put on but stays in place i would recommend
i bought this online to wear in my engagement photos and its absolutely perfect i typically wear a size l or xl and could have easily worn the l in this top runs a tad big keep in mind it is on the shorter side i will be purchasing a white tank to wear underneath it
the material of the lace is nice and soft it is not a stiff lace i am    and ordered the small it fits perfect not tight through bust or the arm holes i wore today for the first time and everyone that sees the top loves it as much as i do i ordered the white and in the pictures it looks like a bright white it is not it is more of an antique white and i am wearing a nude colored camisole and it works perfect i think it will be really cute with a colored cami also this will
this top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if youre an outgoing person especially for a summer evening my only confusion is the too high neckline if it was just a little lower it would look and feel less chokey i keep wanting to pull it down im a size  and needed the xxs which fits like most peoples xss as sizing continues to get bigger really lovely except for the neckline looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas
what a cute top its a little on the short side for me  but im keeping it because it is so pretty the lace is lightweight and delicate but seems like it will hold up pretty well trying to decide what to wear under it but i think it could look cute with a cami for work or even a cute bra that has some coverage for super casual days the lace is completely sheer but doesnt feel as revealing as i would expect would be super cute over a swim top with jean shorts and sandalswish i li

love these pants the color is a true red and they are very flattering on i ordered the  but they are a little big and i think the pant will give a little when wearing just reordered the size 
i really love this dress but i am still struggling with keeping it or not i have an hour glass figure with a somewhat fullish behind  it is tight around that area which i think it is meant to be but i am not sure how comfortable i am with that i wasnt sure about the belt but it really works i am  and weigh  i did have to size up from  to  p for it not to feel too tight in all areas

i tried this top on in the store and didnt buy it because i was in a hurry obsessed about it and it was sold out when i went back so happy i was able to get it online its beautiful i got a medium and it fits perfectly enough room that it hangs nicely but not baggy im typically a medium in shirts at retailer it looks beautiful with high waisted black pants i wear a cami underneath i own it in white and tried it on with a black bra only and it looked great i just didnt feel comfortable
i love this dressbut and it saddened me that there was a but the material would wrinkle near the sleeves fit issue and the high neckline was a little uncomfortable i ended up returning it because at this price point i need perfection i would definitely recommend this dress it just wasnt for me
"the lace on this looks like it would be stiff but it isnt its soft and drapes nicely i normally buy an xl if its not a knit and so i did the top will fit up to a size  in the xl because it is boxy and generous it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body it looks looser in the photoits as see through as the photo and i wouldnt wear a cami under it that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho i think a nude bra works just fine you can see the model is wearing a white bra"
absolutely love this sweater because it is so pretty while being soft and comfortable i am  and purchased the smallit falls a little below my hips while the color matches everything the pockets and details add a nice touch and the longer sleeves are cozy the only drawback is it pills and sheds
i usually try to buy things on sale but after trying this dress on twice i didnt want to run the risk of waiting and it selling out it is extremely flattering and i think it will be very versatile  ill definitely wear this dress to work out with friends and you could also wear it to bridalbaby shower events as well i bought the dress in blue and it is extremely comfortable i do think it runs large  i am   with a very straight no hips  athletic build have an athlete butt

"dress is beautiful in person light material that is excellent for summerthis dress is not forgiving in the chest so ladies if you bigger chested i suggest going up a size or two im   lbs and  i usually wear  or  this dress in a  made my look like i was wearing an unflattering sports bra"
"too bad the blue one is sold out in my size petite i ordered the  based on feedback at m store that it runs big that was a good choice i am   lbs the material teds to wrinkle though so will have to think about keeping itcut is flattering i like it with the belt like the picture on the model but was nice too with the drawstring and a nice chunky necklace bought black dress so gold necklace is nicelength was mid calf but because it has a rounded hem it wa"

i bought this dress in gray in a size  i am usually a size  even an  in maeve so i said this dress runs a tad large it is soft and easy to wearthrow it on and go i think it looks best with a belt but thats my opinion i am   tall and this is a midi length on me plenty long not sure how it will wash i think a fabric steamer will be needed all in all very pleased

i bought this dress in the print and the moss color and may very well return for the dark gray for reference i am   lbs i have been more recently wearing size  but a  was perfect so i do think it runs a bit large this dress has a drawstring that ties in the back and cinches the waist up nicely and is very flattering the waist actually hits at the natural waistline and not up on the ribs the fabric is lightweight and washes well i washed and immediately hung dry it was slight
this is a cute top but the sleeves are super long  they swallowed up my entire hand when i put my arms down to the side  i also found it to run slightly large  i ordered my usual medium and i had too much room under the armpits  the sleeves werent as fitted as the model shot either which i would of preferred  i probably could of shortened the sleeves but didnt think this style top fit me so i sent it back  this does not require a cami underneath
great staple item i have it in multiple colors and like them all easy to add statement necklace to change up the look wear it under cardi or jacket to make it not look tent like
"i ordered both the petite and regular in the olive green motif the regular fit more as i was hoping so i returned the petitei am only   but my legs are long for my height i wasnt ready to have the side slits up to here and whereas they are not they are still quite high it is modest enough to be worn any place i might wear the dress i think i will likely wear a belt with it as shown at least part of the time i just bought some print fabric sling back shoes which go beautifully with"
"i ordered this dress in small my usual size for reference   lb it is too wide it looks more fitted in the pictures and hangs loose on me the belt does not help much it still looks like a sack and i feel like a girl wearing her moms dressalso i found that the material crumples easily"
lots of embellishment striking magenta color feels great on with a flattering neckline that isnt too low i recommend it
material is nice great for a party or date night fits true to size l for me im a  would recommend the bell sleeve is right on trend and very tasteful
this is a cute swing top tts but generous best thing about it the color i got purple and it is so pretty and saturated i think itll look great with big gold hoop earrings alone or under a cardigan or denim jacket id consider other colors at sale price
"one of the reasons i avoid skirts at all costs is because i have a bigger tummy and dont like the extra tight feeling i have of a skirt around my waist i like this skirt because of its stretchiness even wore it to a bbq where i could eat my heart out and not feel constricted at allreceived many compliments including you look like youre vacating in the caribbean"
i think i own nearly every maeve skirt retailer has sold over the last five years and this might be my new favorite one major improvement over years past is the fitit really is true to size rather than running large as has been the case in the past the material is a substantial stretchy jersey with a nice texture the weight of the fabric combined with the jersey slip means its not sheer at all and it also a nice smooth fit skimming over lessthanperfect areas i also really appreciate
love the color pattern tiny gold buttons flattering fit quality of fabric and make  i got size  petite which fits perfectly my husband said they looked really good on me and were keepers im    highly recommend 
saying that these pants are comfortable would be redundant they are over  above in comfort i wear a size  and they are right on in sizing i want to comment on the colorprint to see the green i had to take the pants by a window with natural light and look closely that being said i think the pants take on the color of top one chooses i walked through my closet with the pants in hand they match with light grey periwinkle blue light sky blue navy white your choice i do prefer a so

great skirt i bought the red and paired it with a casual white button down i feel like the top definitely needs to be short or tucked in for the look to work i am typically a  in bottoms and went with the small in this the xs probably fits more like its intended to but it is very curvehugging and i was more comfortable with the looser fit of the small especially since i am tucking in a blouse there is stretch in the skirt and the fabric has a nice feel

these are the softest jeans ever i love the way that they hold their shape and make my bum look amazing i am  and they do come much longer than shown on the modelright below my ankle bone i actually prefer this because they will be wearable right through fall if i pair them with booties the fit is true to  pounds and i got a  highly recommend
i ordered this online in a m and l because i am usually one of those on the bottom  i will be returning both for a s the fabric is great and a cool pattern but it runs large by far in addition to the large sizing the fabric has a decent stretch so that makes it even larger i think the small will fit well and the cut is flattering  i am about  and it hits below my knees similar to the model in the picture so i would definitely get this in petite if youre on the shorter side its al
really beautiful skirt unique print red and stylish keep in mind this is knit stretchy form fitting as mentioned the skirt is very comfortable and a heavier texture fabric i purchased a large i am  and  and dont like skirts too tight so i sized up the large is fine however i noticed at the bottom of the skirt it doesnt quite fit as slim as i would like i suspect the m would be better if you have a stomach it will show i also noticed that the skirt seemed much longer on
beautiful and flowy blouse  bottom is very full so i recommend sizing down   size very feminine and i really like the colors and pattern i am a  on top and found top flattering with pilcro serif legging like jeans and booties
i saw this shirt online loved it but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small however retailer shirts tend to be long on me so i ordered a petite small it fits great i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long the shirt comes to my hips for reference im   lbs and my measurements are 
i bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back  the texture is nice but lets call them what they are thin leggings  not worth the price in my opinion  honestly i cant seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so id spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans
i love the flowybeachy look of this jumpsuit it is very comfortable and super cute my only gripe is that the hip part is pretty wide hands in the pockets you cant tell but if i were to get this i would want a xxs length was ok not petite since it is a flowy look colors are very nice too kind of  but i love it i think i will get this if it goes to sale even if it is a little big on me i am  lbs  chest and tried on xs
i ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewers comment that they were unflattering on the back side they really do hug your bum but that is not what bothers me what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top they are not wearable in public or around other people i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer but also some of the most poorly designed unfortunately these fall in the latter category
found this jumpsuit in standard size smallred motif pictures dont do it justice instore and to my surprise it actually fit of course it was billowy since im short  and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet which i dont mind i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest areanear my armpitslike normal women usually have ladi
super comfortable pant they dont feel or look like jeans but will hug your body like jeans i bought the regular size   they waist is not tight and i needed to roll up the bottoms about  inches i have not washed or dried these yet but i imagine they will wash well
ill admit its been a few months since ive shopped at retailer i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesnt seem to be much consistency between the brands im so glad i wandered in our local store this week this top is so beautiful in person and wellmade the embroidery is lovely and its lined so not too sheer im tall and it was a good length hitting just above the hip i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big the s fit perfectly across the chest

like other reviewers have said this is very sheer look at the sleeve in the picture and youll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well the material posed challenges for its creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other tight enough that it would have ripped if i werent careful tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life loose billowy and perhaps
"this is as pretty in person as it is online good quality except one item ill get to and fits true to size im  normally a  and the medium fit great in this topi almost kept this shirtso close i had it on a hanger but i kept trying it on the shirt is well displayed in the pics online but unless you get close its hard to see that the top button is set a little wide every time i put it on my eyes went to the top button i did get a second opinion and they agreed"
i love boys and arrows but this top is really best suited to smaller size chests because theres no adjustable ties or straps or reinforcements for support also the fabric is super soft which is great for feel but not so much for fit if you require a little boost for my  i chose a different design
this jumpsuit is absolutely fabulous i normally dont wear jumpsuit but i like this one very much it can be dresse down or dressied up i really recommend this to everyone any shape who have very relaxing and beautiful
i love the pilcro line and these leggings yes definitely more a legging than jean did not disappoint however i did think the material would have a little more substance and weight  they are pricey so i am hoping that the thinness of the material will not prevent them from holding up well
i have this color also in the grey  flattering interesting shirt i have think hips but a fuller waist the vertical lines of this shirt design suggest otherwise great to pair with torn up skinny jeans love the petite line now in portland

i saw this online and loved it i wanted to wait for a sale and a promotion but this teeshirt sold out in the color holly completely sold out but for petite i bought a s and a m the small works it is comfortable it can be dressy or very casual i bought the white and the carbon it is a different style on a tee if you notice the front neck and the bottom of the back you will see what i mean i recommend this highly i cant imagine anyone not liking it
"i ordered it with a particular outfit in mind as i liked the purple burgundy color ordered xxsp as with most tshirts at retailer they run a little big xxs seems to be my new xs which used to be scolor was nice  fit was good too i just felt not special enough but if you are looking for a tshirt then i say give it a try as it was comfortable and the shape at least is unusualfor reference  lbs   in waist"
i was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand but im a little unsure the front part hangs a bit too low on my  frame yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides im just not sure it hangs right on me its fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely and looks great with the front loosely tucked just not what i was expecting
i didnt think top was very flattering and while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottomjust looks missewn instead of purposeful sadly this one is going back to the store
loved the colors greenish coal and white and shirt texture but the fit was horrible i sized up to an xl because you can never tell sizing with this line that didnt help it fit although a bit long but the deal breaker was that i looked huge from the side view since i carry my weight in my mid section highlow cuts on the side are tricky on my frame it fit well in the bust over my  and looked nice from the front i do recommend it if you have my body issues you might pass

i loved this top when i saw it online and i still love the idea of it unfortunately the execution of the design fell short im  w a long lean torso i ordered my usual small and the arms on the shirt were so long bc of the way the sides of the top cut up and my  d chest i dont think a petite would work for me such a cute top but it just wont work for me

this is a nice easy go to shirt that i will be grabbing for this fall comfy but still styled to add a little fun in the everyday white tee
love the design of the tshirt but the quality is poor in my opinion i got the white tshirt and the material is so fragile i can see it tearing or being prone to rips after only a few wears for the price i thought the quality is not up to par the white tshirt is see through but with a nude camisole underneath it is fine
i want to love this top  it is so pretty but i find the fit very odd i think it runs big but the arm holes seem to be cut really low i would love to size down but then i think the sleeves would be off unfortunately i will have to return it

there was nothing i liked about this coat it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on i usually like oranges too but even this color turned me off
super soft super cute but too short for a dress too long and too overwhelming for a shirt and didnt like the look with leggings at all so sadly im returning love the colors feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functionalhaving said thatfits tts i guess
i love this dress i do agree with the other reviewers  it does come up higher on the sides it has a hilo hem style on me but im short  and got the petite xxs and its not too short to wear as a dress its super cute if youre shorter and dont mind showing a little leg i highly recommend it

this dress is beautiful i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress in my mind it takes me back to the  and  more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early  century the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls
this was a splurge piece for my fall wardrobe however i will be returning it its extremely heavy and bulky the collar doesnt lay rightits tall so it wants to flop over but its too bulky to fold and stay down i went a size down and the sleeves are hugewide and too long its not flattering on my figurei have a booty but the sweater doesnt show curves at all i also thought the colors were dingy not bright like the photo i think it would look good on someone tall and slender als
this is a great dress for me to wear to work lounging on a sunday and everywhere inbetween id even wear it over a bathing suite on a chilly beach highly recommend it
i love this dress i will be living in it this fall and winter the color is perfect the fabric is soft seriously it is so conformable and cute i will style it with booties tall boots with vests wear it as a tunic i love it as a dress i didnt think it was too short at all im  so things tend to be short on my anyway but i thought this was perfect and hit in the right spots love love love it
i really liked this dress i agree with the others that say the side seam comes up pretty high i think id wear as a tunic or open like the model i cant justify full price though tts my normal med fit
i read prior reviews and decided to go forward with my purchase i am so pleased that i did the m fit nicely the fabric is not as soft as i had wished however i think with wear it will become broken in
this blouse is so pretty i love the design the material and the pattern is so unique i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princessfeeling i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints i adore it and feel so good wearing it if i could change anything id m

got this in white and love the scallop detail the material is also super soft and stretchy i wouldve absolutely loved this in black but i feel like the white enhances my hips a bit too much i think this would be super cute on a taller frame got my usual xs and it was a perfect fit

i got this dress in the gray size small and it fits me perfectly it hides flaws in your figure and is nice enough that it can be worn to the office and then out later for a date or dinner i did not try on the whiteblack combo because i thought the white top part might be too sheer unlike other reviewers i think the contrast of fabrics works im not sure why there are negative reviews here i must have the right body type for it because i love it
this jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful i usually wear a size  or small in everything at retailer sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it too tight on chest and arms i recommend going a size up also this jacket is really cropped probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it otherwise might appear too short
nothing wrong with the dress sadly its the body im putting it on thats less than perfect fits fine and tts but just doesnt do anything for my bit wide hips other than adds to them hangs nicely but jersey top and nylon bottom add to the wide hip issue that said i think i may still keep it as its a great length not too short and a nice simple dress really versatile

i dont buy many jackets retired but i think they are still useful i had my doubts about this jacket  like could they really get the trim straight at this price but they did the jacket is casual but sophisticated i got the grey and the color is just as pictured i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet i am pleased and i think you will be too

i got size  it comes down a little over my knee cap and i wish it was rather a little above it i have a small chest about  and with a padded push up bra it was still bit loose on the top i do have a shorter torso i feel like i couldve gone with the  petite im a pear shape and more like a size  on the bottom and i weigh about  there is tons of room to go smaller  it is not form fitting on the bottom at all has that slight polyester feel but the fabric is beautiful and thick

this shirt spoke to me as soon as i entered the store i love the colorful plaid the flattering cut and the light airy material at very least i think this will be a threeseason go to
this spandex top in my opinion is workout wear it is not the tank i expected to receive but my bad it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is it should fit like this    lbs medium is skin tight color is nice but as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisionedit has to go back to retailer quality seems fair
the stitching is why i like this dress even though the arms and waist were a little large on me i decided to keep it because of the beautiful pattern i think going a size down from what i normally wear would be too tight across my back or too short i will wear it with a cardigan tights and boots as the weather gets cooler
nice practical tank that i can wear with everything but the fabric is kind of weird  overly warm and pulls up around the bottom when i wear it sometimes i would still recommend it but just know its not just a cotton tank
"i was in love with this top as soon as i saw it i love the patchwork and i think it is well put together ive worn it once the day i got it i was so excited and washed it and it is still in great shapei liked it with the sleeves rolled up and the bottom tucked in as it was a little longer than im used to but nothing too long my torso is shortthe material is not thick or heavy and the sleeves and some patches are kinda thin nice material but not something to wear if its very ch"
great material and i like the idea of a scoop  v neck combination but the hem rolls up making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt and even there its a little bulky its possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem
i saw this dress in the catalog and online and it looked so lovely on the models i took a chance and ordered it in my normal size small when it arrived i was a little disappointed with the weight of the fabric it was a bit light in my opinion it did have an interesting texture suede like so i could overlook the weight of the fabric if the dress fit well unfortunately it did not it rather just hung there and was not flattering on me it looked wonderful on the model but i keep forgettin
i had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered but i took a chance and ordered the regular size i love it it is a little long in the back but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt so cute with skinny jeans and leggings it is one of my favorite fall tops i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays
this pair of age stevie capris is everything that i could want in a pair of jeans soft sexy without being skintight and the perfect color of blue i am  lbs and the  was a perfect fit these hit about an inch above my ankle and looked amazing think legs that look a mile long with booties one night and nude heels the next
the fabric of this dress feels like suede i couldnt stop touching it here comes the but the dress is cut straight down no definition the rosette lace is sewn on like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap i tried it on with a belt and by itself and i still feel like its just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store im a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed size s regu

i am most pleased with this tunic purchased it in red nice quality and very comfortable casual top it has a flattering cut that isnt boxy for a long tunic so its flattering the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesnt add any bulk which is a bit slimming it would work well for a wide variety of body types i may buy the blue as well
this dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice it does have an aline fit in the skirt the stitching is beautiful honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me some may like that but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress the fabric is cotton and it is not lined i am  and it does hit right about where it does on the model i am sending it back because i didnt say wow i love this w
beautiful neutral color in a comfortable fabric fits tts i am  ft  in and went with the petite it is a midi on me i have other skirts from retailer from past years in similar fabric and will say that overtime the waist will stretch even if hand washed carefully so that being said buy your size in this skirt dont go bigger to get a longer length you can wear it lower on your hips if you like it longer which i think actually looks more flattering in any case its a great piece that no o
this is a beautiful springsummer dress and the quality of the materials is great i wanted to love it but the sizing is ridiculous im  and  and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs while the pictures of the model in the dress dont suggest it has a shapeless cut it definitely looked like a sack on me a sack with a lovely print but still an illfitting sack

i was looking for a top that would be comfortable as fall was approaching and this hit the mark it isnt fitted but it doesnt look sloppy either though it is comfy and is called a sweatshirt the fabric allowed me to pair it with a charcoal skirt i am very pleased with this shirt and would highly recommend it as it can be worn casually with jeans or paired with a skirt
im so upset that this didnt work out im petite at  and ordered this skirt in petite however i felt like it swallowed me up the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire im the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing but on me i feel like a schoolmarm sadly this is going back
i received these pants today and theyre perfect as another reviewer stated i would definitely not wear these for lounging you can dress them up or down i feel like these will be my favorite goto pants this spring i highly recommend the design and pockets are perfect

i hesitated to buy this skirt even though it was love at first sight i was afraid it would be to heavy and add weight im so happy i ordered this one itll be a closet staple for me i love skirts and am blessed to live in a mild climate in california i can wear it all year long right now i can pair it with a slim turtleneck tucked in with high heel boots or heels later can pair with crisp white button up tide at the waist and strappy sandals or a tank top and sandals it goes with
i am not generally a fan of sweatshirts but when i saw this on a recent retailer email i new i had to check it out the colors are more vibrant in person and not muted like the photo but this wasnt a deal breaker for me because of the boxy shape i went with a s i love the cozy feel and that it is still stylish i can see this piece getting a lot of use this fallwinter in fact i am wearing it right now
i havent worn these yet but i wouldnt wear them just to lounge in i wear an xs  they fit good  tts they have an elastic waist but it drapes nice  doesnt bunch like some do the material is soft  hangs nice  doesnt seems like it will wrinkle love the pattern of the black print ones its black tan  white  kind of a paisley print i think it looks better on than in the picture
i tried this on in the store and loved it it is very comfortable i sized up one or two sizes i am very thin and somewhat petite but wanted a little more length it will be a great dress for fall as the fabric is heavy enough to wear into fall i think it looks better in person than online would recommend it if you like this kind of dress love that it has pockets too great quality

"i was looking for a dress that had a lot of color since i usually stick to neutrals this was out of my comfort zone but i found this one and loved it its comfortable not clingy and i can wear a regular bra bonus i wish the waist wasnt dropped but i think it worked well i plan on wearing it more in the springsummer dressing it up or down will be easy im usually a size  and this fit true to size"
i bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe it is really cute and a flattering cut i just had a baby so its perfect for showing some curves without clinging if anything id say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected but is still very flattering i think im still getting used to my new bustline  soft comfy fabric not too hot i get compliments when i wear it

purchased this top because of the sale i got it in the peach and the maize i think it is big boxy and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have the colors are vibrant and striking pretty with shorts and capris i did size down from  to 
love this top bought it in black and first day i wore it to a party and i think everyone gave me a compliment it is very flattering to my shape have a bit of a pooch and cant even tell looks great with skinny jeans look forward to wearing many more times
i really love the look and feel of this top perhaps this was mentioned in previous reviews but it is unlined which i hadnt realized when i ordered it so the eyelet details are will expose skin unless you wear a cami underneath
i lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it fits well although i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway fits very true to size i cant wait to wear this with boots and leggings
like the other reviewers have said this is a wider shirt but the width done is in a stylish way i did not think it looked frumpy or sacklike on however i found it to be rather short i bought a  regular not petite and it fits shorter than many shirts i have from retailer madewell etc which have the same looser fit i am   lbs so it is odd that it fit somewhat short on meif you are tall it might bare your midriff some i bought the peach which was close to the color pictu
i bought this top in  colors it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear so i bought it in the  color its so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations  travel weekends and work the feel of the fabric is gorgeous but it pills after wear so when the top went on sale i bought an extra set of all  colors now i have a set for play and a set for work i love this shirt
this top is absolute perfection i dont think the photo does it justice as it looks so much better untucked i dont even have great toned arms but its still so flattering i got the gray one amd might get another color great value as well im petite   and bought my usual size small
so much extra fabric not something i would recommend buying online
i originally bought this from my local retailer in an xs petite i think it was a return i brought it home and decided it was just too big for my   frame i ordered it in an xxs petite and am keeping it the colters are just so pretty and it is machine washable which is an added bonus it is still flowy but not objectionably so it is meant to be unstructured and bohemain i think looking forward to wearing this on my upcoming trip to italy

i know a lot of folks thought this top was too bigboxy but im pretty slim up top with a big booty quintessential pear shape and i think the shape is totally flattering your mileage may vary but with free returns id just try it on first  i sized down one size which helped and got the raspberry  colored one i adore the color  its impossibly vibrant and beautiful for spring summer or fall the eyelets dont have any cloth underneath just bare skin  but theyre so small that i don
i wanted to love this top so badly between the beautiful photos and the good reviews i didnt think i could go wrong with it unfortunately it just didnt look great on the bust area sagged on my smaller chest and then the top flared way out from the waist down it doesnt lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types the quality does appear to be good  the material is weighty and soft
must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes beautiful im machine washing w delicates n hang dry comes out great easy breezy
i am  and wear between a  pant and ml tops depending i would consider myself a pear bodytype bc i have a thicker midsection and flat everywhere else for this i ordered a medium and it was slightly loose so if you are conscious about your midsection ordering your normal size will probably be fine the fabric is very lightweight like a normal drapey tshirt would be made out of just to keep in mind the draping is really cool though i would just probably handwash dryclean or if
i ordered my usual size s in the purple print this peplum top style colorspattern will go easily with pretty much anything shorts pants jeans  skirts wear for casual or dress it up for me the fit is tts armholes provide good coverage  length is fine the top has a bit of stretch  doesnt feel restrictive the waist is banded  a little loose which is fine dont like tight fitting waists on tops i like that the waist seems a little lower than other peplum tops at retailer the skirt
this shirt has it all great staple piece to add to your wardrobe not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down

this cute top is made in the usa yay it is a flattering cut and looks great under jackets i prefer the ivory color and feel of the fabric the black and white was cute but hung strangely and felt stiff i am size smmed  and went with the small cowl is cozy and can be styled to keep you warm
"perfect very pretty and flattering without being too fussy helps to hide my tummy and very well made that said i have fairly wide shoulders and a larger ribcage so i had to size up considerably usually a  or a  and i needed a  to be comfortable the  went on but the fabric has no give so i sized up i am never a  but thats what worked in this blouse surprisingly it still looked nice and tailored definately runs on the smaller sidelovely worth the full price in my opinion"
"i used to be a solid  then had to move down to  and  i am  and  lbs in this definitely a  the tighter part in the fitted waist is why i recommend peiople sizing up if you are between sizes choose bigger teh cutis so flattering it wont matterthe colros are really pretty the flow of the shirt is romantic sleeves are forgivin cant go wrong hte back is a little longer and covers the tushy i can see this with flared bottoms or pencil skirt or skiny jeans even"
i love the fit of these pants  starts for that i wish the pockets were a little closer together but its not the end of the world considering how well they fit the real drawback is that the dye runs like no other pants ive had before i had them on for a few hours and my fingernails had turned green and my skin was a greenish color i am going to try to soak them in water a few times to see if that helps i would still recommend these pants but wash them a couple times before you wear the
i love this blouse but my normal size didnt even come close to fitting me i think i would have had to go  sizes up too bad cause it is a beautiful top not good for us busty girls though
this is a very feminine and pretty top but it runs really small after reading the reviews i ordered a size larger however i think i should have ordered  sizes larger
i love this top  it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently but often skimps on now tit definitely runs small  i usually wear a  in retailer tops sometimes a  and the  is quite fitted on me
this is a gorgeous blouse but it runs small in my opinion i consistently wear a size  in moulinette soeurs and im trying to decide if a  will still be too small and if i need to exchange for a  construction and materials are lovely just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse
beautiful top but runs very small based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up regardless i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an
this is a beautiful blouse that runs one to two sizes too small i usually wear an  maybe a  on a bad day i couldnt get into the  the  was uncomfortably tight and even the  was snug i havent worn a size  anything since i was pregnant years ago i think this blouse would look best on a woman without any curves as it adds curves to any womans body since i already have curves i felt like jessica rabbit in this blouse it was too much for me again lovely blouse but i would no
i love this denim jacket its just a basic light denim jacket with a casual preworn soft feel i like how its slightly cropped i think it runs fairly truetosize possibly a little on the small side i am   lbs and  and i ordered a medium for a more relaxed fit if i had wanted the fit shown on the model i would have ordered a small  but i prefer jackets to be a bit looser i love it

this is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale trust the other reviewers that it does run small i am normally a  or  on top and i got the   and its a bit snug it is very fitted below the bust but thats what makes it look so nice on i would definitely recommend but know that sizing is off
i love this skirt as a fan of different textures and pretty things this piece exceeded my expectations i am always a size  or  in retailer dresses and the  fits like a glove the length is perfect  just above the knee ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick neoprene material ive adored the feel of it everything feels firm and put together the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic it will pair well with lots of different tops too
i love these jeans but they run small i recommend ordering one size up
i bought this to wear to and english garden themed party and i loved it for this event it is very bright maybe even more than the pictures if thats possible and the skirt is was long on my  frame so i had to get it it hemmed several inches so that it didnt give the  housewife look it was comfortable and i the skirt had just enough poof to make me feel great i could wear a regular bra but not sure where else im going to wear this but im going to try to come find another event worthy
i love this skirt i wasnt sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too the quality is great  the skirt is a fine silk ant it is lined so you dont need a slip i think it fits perfectly for my body type and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway i am normally a  petite   waist  hips 
i really wanted to love this shirt it looked so nice and cool for summer and i dont own anything purple the color was really nice very subtly feminine i am a little too short for this style though i am  ft  inch  lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide the side slits came up a little too high for my liking but i easily couldve stitched those up a bit and theyd have been fine i think this would look great on taller women but on me it looked like a dumpy sack
i usually wear a  and ordered two other skirts at the same time the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size  very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it
i wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm they get the job done and for an incredible price they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside im not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but its subtle and i dont mind it they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots the length not a problem my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg retailer kindly sent me a new pair for
truly the only word that comes to mind when i think of this dress is dazzling the pictures online just barely do it justiceif you have an retailer nearby check to see if its available in store and go check it out in person it does not disappoint every year around this time our beloved retailer seems to come out with this style of dress in the years past they have all been different and beautiful but i think they have truly outdone themselves this year this dress is a deep emerald green

these are my new favorite leggings they have everything i need  soft waist band that doesnt squeeze me at all not overly long subtle ribbed texture black pair that make them feel just a little nicer and most importantly they are not see thru at all so soft on the inside too and this price is nuts too im so happy with these
i bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frameim  i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays would def recommend this dress
i stumbled upon this item at my local retailer and immediately had to true it on the colors are so lovely in person after trying it on i was disappointed  the material has a foamyair feel to it and the skirt seems to run small needless to say i didnt purchase this item
i think the shirt is supposed to be a relaxed  fit but i could have definitely gone down a size
from quality to design and overall comfortthese leggings have it all they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing its just enough to add a little something i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black for the price its more than worth it

just got this top in the mail today and i love it i bought the white in a small and it fits as pictured on the model the fabric says its cotton but its a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk the bodice is lined so no bra lines show through the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or seethrough the arm holes are not too large as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops i think ill be wearing this one a lot this summer and a lot of summers
these are fabulous leggings for cold days i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm love them and i highly recommend only con is that they are about  of an inch shorter than i would like
so soft comfortable and warm i ordered the black and think ill buy the grey and lavender as well the material is a little syntheticalmost shiny looking but definitely not a deal breaker these are my new lounge pants recommend

this is a cute jacket nice materials comfortable and feels very well made i read some reviews about sizing and went with a small when i am usually an xs or s the small was too big and boxy feeling i think i would have liked it better if it felt like a more tailored fit the design is definitely different and i played around with the collar drape thing but it felt a little awkward to me overall i think its a cute jacket but i sent it back not for me

this jacket is stunning the vegan leather has a slight shimmer the waterfall fabric is nice and soft its really beautiful and unique cropped jackets tend to shorten me but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight they were better in the xsp but i wont be wearing any thick sweaters underneath it fit everywhere else im usually an xxsp and sized up for the arms ove
i buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online i would say size wise its consistent for tiny which in my opinion is in the runs small category as im a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl anyway the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top and if that snap pops open its open all the way down to the waist area where
"   normally size i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did it is very flattering on my curvy frame it does run a big big so i sized down to a  instead of my normal size  the top is still a tad bit big as another commented not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldnt wear it to work without a cami under it over all i love this dress its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty i bought the orange motif"
i ordered a size  and an  based on the review that said that the piece ran small i fit both skirts but chose the size  as it was a bit looser at the hip and the length was better funny thoughthe pockets on both skirts were sewn at very uneven areas on both neither skirt had usable pockets as they were sewn shut at half inch intervals on one skirt  and very uneven intervals on the other  i liked the idea of pockets which is one reason i ordered itit is described as having side poc
i didnt notice what some of the other reviews have said i think its very flattering makes my waist look tiny and the flouncy skirt is a lot of fun it is low cut in the bust but not crazy im a modest person and im comfortable with it what i like best however it the cut of the top it is wide enough at the arms to cover any armpit bulge the fabric is very light and soft and the colors are vibrant and fun it does run a tad large i can go between a  and  in most retailer dresses and got
as soon as i saw this skirt i was in love i like the fit it is very comfortable i love the detail in the crocheted part of the skirt i cant wait to wear it and i recommend this item
great top for everyday wear runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath
it is indeed cut to the shape of a trench however i think retailer should rename it as its more like wearing a cardigan its soft and pretty which i like however i wasnt convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material
this is a very lovely sweater dress it looks just as pictured and true to size i ordered mine online and was very happy with this purchase the material of the top white portion is very soft and cozy and bottom peach chiffon material has sparkly stones sweater dress is very pleasant on the skin and looks refreshing recommend
everything about this jumper is lovely the color the fit the fabric corduroy anything rules but the first day i wore it the zipper was a problem it was missing a tooth my husband helped me work around that to zip it up for a sunday drive i unzipped to nurse our baby and then we couldnt get it back up and it just separated leaving me half dressed in the restaurant was going to have it repaired but will send back now that i see they have more i dont know about yall but i always feel a
i am   small waist wide hips dress fits perfectly a little longer than i had expected hits about midcalf on me great quality corduroy nice medium green color very unique sort of vintage feel piece
first off this shirt is a hd in paris brand not floreat i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top please change brand name
"unlike one comment below a review on here who stated it felt childish i didnt feel this way at all im a sucker for anything white with tulle and soft colors and a bit of bling  heres my thoughtspros very soft with good amount of stretch tulle bottom is exactly as pictured i disagree with another reviewer who said the color was more of taupe it is not this is pinknude shade all the way runs tts im a  hourglass  and found the medium to be"

i love the texture and sheen of corduroy combined with this beautiful evergreen color i purchased size  and the somewhat stretchy fit accommodates my bust size  with a blouse or slim fitting sweater quite well i think the skirt flares out too much and ends a little too low for my height so im waiting for the petite to arrive to see if its more flattering i picked tts but may be a bit large for those who are less busty so you may want to size down if youre slender or pear shaped
this dress is incredible let me say that when it first arrived i was terrified that i looked like a got tangled in my grandmas curtain the print was really overwhelming for my living room however i went with my gut and wore this dress for our engagement photos out in the woods not only was in incredibly flattering it photographed better than i could have imagined wouldnt recommend wearing this grocery shopping but this is a perfect for a special occasion
i love this shimmer tankin both colors it is a very thin fabricthinner than i would have expected but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank i think you can never go wrong with sparkles especially in a layering tankit dresses up or fancies up the outfit the straps on this tank are not adjustable and if you are large chested i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh

i like the idea of a skort and how it is different than everything else out there this skort is a bit dressyperfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe i love that it has pockets the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice it fit me true to size i cant wait for warmer weather to wear it
in love with this dress so feminine and lovely makes you feel beautiful the fabric flow and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering i am  and  lbsbought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area  however the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me cannot wait to wear this dress but it is so long needs to be altered itll be worth it
cute summervacation dress lightweight material but not flimsy im normally a xss and i ordered the s petite which was right bc i think the xs would have been too clingy looking the regular length would also have been too long
gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts highly recommend both
beautiful tee and cut with a classic simple silhouette nice weight and true to size im   and the small fits me like i like not tight at all with room to allow for shrinkage i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little selfconscious in due to the low cut neck maybe if i werent as small chested this wouldnt be an issue for me i definitely recommend this tee
the dress is beautiful it is very long romantic and feminine i am  and it touches the ground i tried on an xl normally i am a l and today i wore a size m retailer dress to work and i could not even begin to zip the xl dress the arms were fine i think i would need  sizes higher i am so sad because it is so beautiful
i loved this dressuntil i washed it the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to drywhich i did washed on delicate now its not the same dress its too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved just kind of annoyed so its an awesome dress just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it
very cute skort that fits tts great length for us middle aged women as well love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts im assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband i usually try to wait for the sale prices but i think this skort will sell out well before then
was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress i have already a few events lining up for the summer months and i could see this working on those hot summer days im short and curvy so i tried on the large in store im busty and ended up ordering the petite l online the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room i love the  length i feel a great length when youre only  will look great wi
"love the dress its beautiful and flowy and makes you feel like a princess when you wear it also very versatile as it can be worn in multiple seasons and dressed up or dressed down love everything about the dress and know that it will become a staple in my closet runs true to size xs   and s   if you are short be prepared to have the hem taken up worth the buy"
i love this top i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more i can pair it with blue jeans my pink pilcro chinos and even my turquoise pilcro shorts i love that this tee doesnt have the rolled sleeves so its a little more finished looking i tried on both the small and medium and both fit but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that for reference im   lbs  chest i do think  is hefty for a tshirt so you could roll the
love this dress so so much the wearability of it isnt much since its such a wow dress but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for itso perfect if it were a touch shorter id be happy wearing it to the park id suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when its so stunning long the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess  although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying  look how cool this is 
i would absolutely recommend this dress if you have the right body type
super soft cap sleeves shirt tail hem and double stitched seams mine is the greygreen motif and tts i bought s  and the fit was perfect the tee can transition into fall as i feel it has a more fall appeal over summer because of the greygreen motif the bluepink motif feels more like summer
i liked the idea of the scarf tie so i tried on this top in the store it was so cute on that i ignored that it was a bit overpriced for the quality the material is more of a tshirt with elastic at the bottom so it poofs a bit rather than laying flat im not sure how durable the fabric is its still really flattering and the scarf color adds a bit of a pop to the navy color i think ti would look great with jeans but with the right pants i could dress it up a bit and wear it to work it

this is one of those pieces that are timeless special and absolutely stunning the body of the jacket is quilted very boxy and the embroidery and beading on the jacket is what makes it absolutely gorgeous the inside of the jacket is this super soft incredible fleecy fur it adds to the luxury of the jacket in regard to fit its very boxy if you live near an retailer i would highly recommend popping in to try it on i personally wish it was a smudge longer but i think the detail and style of

i love this dress it is so flattering and comfortable i am petite with curves and feel so good when wearing this i ordered a petite small i will have to stop myself from wearing it every day this summer
this dress makes me feel like the princess of fall it is very slimming the colors are much brighter in real life they look pastel here but are more pronounced love this dress
i absolutely adore this set its beautifully constructed perfect for something special but comfortable enough for everyday wear i normally wear a  c but got the  ab and it fits perfectly my only complaint is that the longline portion tends to ride up and rest just below the underwire as there is no band holding the lace in place along the bottom still it is far and away my favourite bra and i highly recommend it
i read all the previous reviews and wasnt sure what to think when i saw it on sale at my local retailer store i decided that despite the thin fabric it was worth getting i love the quote spoken by audrey hepburn in the movie sabrina and knew i just needed to add a cami underneath i bought it two days ago and wore it yesterday with a short sleeved open sweater so the quote showed i got two compliments on it within a short time for reference i am  and  lbs i bought a large and i

i am so sad that this romper didnt work out its just way too billowy and huge i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small im petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper might look best on taller girls i am   and about  lbs and this was like wearing a tent do not recommend such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews
i saw this online and loved it instantly i happened to come by it in the store and tried it on it was almost perfect but sadly being busty makes the dress hang not quite as well as it could i think this might be a better dress for the less bustyless curvy but it is super cute and fun
this sweater jacket is beautiful  i wasnt going to try it on because i am very sensitive to fabrics that are itchy but i am so glad i did  its super soft and looks great with jeans and a tshirt  i have a petite frame and it doesnt look boxy at all like some swing styles tend to do  totally recommend this one
absolutely love the design fabric and fit of this dress a perfect dress for many occasions one of the many reasons i love this company excellent customer service employees and of course adorable clothing  would recommend buying this dress and to all the taller girls i am  and  and this dress is still a good length no need to continuously pull down and worry about who might see your rear
i am not a onepiece body type this is the best best best romper i have ever tried on i have a large bottom and this is so forgiving due to the  length of shorts  drapey fabric not clingy  asymmetrical cut of the top highly recommend
on shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but dont think will look that great on me this dress was that item today not only did i like it but i liked the way it looked on me im   pounds and purchased the medium i loved it the clerks loved it and my very honest daughter also loved it i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans
"this is a great summer shirt that will also transition into the fall it is  rayon so flows beautifully and feels really soft and cool against your skin it is also washable i think it looks much better in person than onlinei opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and evenlooking as it tended to gap slightly at the topfor reference i am   lb but have broad shoulders making my usual best size a medium in most tops and"
noticed this sweater as soon as i walked in the store i am   with an athletic build so teeter between a small and medium in tops i spent a long time trying to decide if i preferred the small or medium fit the sweater is a bit boxy so ended up sizing up as the longer length seems to off set some of the boxiness i am looking forward to wearing this with skinny jeans and boots as another reviewer suggested i think a denim shirt will look great underneath rated a good in quality b
i bought this instore and it is much nicer than it appears in the photos online the fabric is soft and drapey making the top lightweight and flowy this is not a fitted shirt and i didnt feel it was overly large so i think it runs true to size i felt fine in an xs t did feel the need to wear a camisole tank with it but i tend towards the modest side i bought it with the widelegged linen pants and have worn it with wedge sandals with many compliments i wish id noticed the navy blue

i love so much about it it really is a gorgeous piece  i just cannot get over the shorter sleeve theres something about it that makes me feel like it looks as though i bought it too small or shrunk it in the dryer   im the only one commenting on that so it must be me lol i think im going to begrudgingly return this one

"sometimes swing styles dont work on me  im on the busty side so they often make me look like im wearing a tent from a side view not so this sweater its more of an aline shape than a swing style and is very flattering  i would think on all body types i love that it zips up and has pockets the plaid is really pretty and the overstitching detail and ribbbed bottom elevate the styling super soft too  not an itch in sight dont know why they call this coloration yellow its n"

i threw this into my cart online on a whim but im not disappointed and i dont even wear rompers usually for reference im  and normally a size  and i bought this romper in a size xs petite if youre on the shorter side i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me and the shorts are about medium length i like the neckline details the armholes in the petite size arent

the style and fit are excellent doesnt make you look frumpy or larger just cant get into the pattern combothe white is too stark and i feel like it was slapped on my chest like a dickey i have the paquerette and thats a mixed bag of patterns that works really well im not sure if i am keeping i may have to bleed it out to soften the white purchased size medium for my  chest and wide rib cage
i was so pleased to see this in the store and i am glad that i had a chance to feel the knit the combination of wool cotton and nylon creates a really soft luxurious feel to the sweater i was shocked that it didnt have cashmere in the blend it is that soft but it is equally substantial this sweater can surely be worn as a piece of outerwear and it can be used as a layering piece i consider this one tts because i typically wear a m in a knit that isnt fitted i disagree with an earl

i definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy i typically run between and xsmall and small should have gone with the xsmall i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it
this shirt is incredibly comfortable the material is so soft and it fits so well i am  and  lbs with a  chest and i purchased a small  it is large on me and i would have preferred an xs but the small is just fine as well it is a great shirt especially for an oversized henley  recommend one star off for the larger sizing
i liked the product shots of this cardigan but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of unimpressed the green wasnt quite the color i was expecting the fabric was rougher the lace was scratchy the fit was boxy and the sleeves are very dolman none of which translated through the pictures online i still think its cute but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting i might reconsider if it hits sale but for now it goes back
i almost walked past this until i saw it on the display mannequin the shimmer is very subtle but there the picture here makes hte shirt look more like a grey shirt but it is more sophisticated in person very soft fabric fitted on the wasit but romier on top cowl is super flattering usual sizze fit very nicely highly recommend i wont hev to tuck it in everytime i wear it  i think it can be dressed up skirt or down jeans almost a basic t

i didnt think from the photo online that the sweater would be quite so sparkly  gold it has gold weaved in  so if the sparkly isnt your thing beware the sweater fit well although i didnt feel the neckline was quite as clean as in the photo above also youd have to be careful not to snag on jewelry its a thin sweater material that may require a camisole underneath depending on the weather

i actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems i am little  and  and i dont think its too boxy at all i like the way it hangs and ill say i like it much more in person than on the model its somehow cozier than it looks in the picture its a real boosh that means comfy i wouldnt have picked it from the online pic but in person it really caught my eye
i was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks unfortunately i was very disappointed when i received it it is as a previous person said very much like a pajama top it is very loose and boxy and in my opinion did not flatter my shape at all sadly i will be returning it i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic or straight and slender as you suggest

"pretty colorlove the lacemy husband thought it looked a little old ladyish but i think it depends on what you wear it withits been too hot here to wear yet i believe it will look great with a cami and leggings"
this top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy however if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough i wish that it had worked because it is so unique
i love this design so much and it is very well made i also like the adjustable shoulder straps and that the cups are not padded cups i think that makes it look less like a bra and more like a bathing suit only con is that it seems to run small
i adore this shirt like a previous reviewer the shirt runs a little small in the bust i got a  instead of my typical  and it looks great the quality is great and the color is lovely the feel of the fabric is nice substantial weight
so thin and see thru its not even wearable in public extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out going back
i ordered this top online and was hoping to love it however it didnt fit me properlythe arm holes were much too large im typically an xs or small i ordered the small and based on this fit i dont think the extra small wouldve fit either  also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thinand with  kids always hanging on me i dont think this top would last very long

the design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great not a lot of functionality then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm i ordered the xsmallsmall and feel i should have ordered the medlarge unless youre super tinyfit id recommend sizing up here i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger

these leggings are so thick and soft they feel like velvet on your skin i am so so happy with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique comfortable and quality pair of leggings

i bought this in size xl it is so much bigger than i expected there are panels of material it really is huge not flattering at all still i kept it the material is so soft  flowy ive gotten good use wearing it around the house doing chores resting etc i wouldnt wear it out doing errands but around home its perfect for feeling cozy such a strange cut i dont know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy i think many would enjoy wearing it at home
i adore this top i ordered in the white and wear it with everything i am a  and size  and purchased the xs it was slightly snug in the arms but it does stretch i just bought the black as well as it truly it a great staple piece forewarning do not dry this my husband accidentally did and i was forced to buy another one since it shrunk so much the fabric is lightweight and great for summer but keep in mind that it is thin and may require something underneath tank top etc
i bought this tshirt in three colors and im keeping them because they work for what i want travel clothes but the tshirts run big and are too boxy i think they look nice if you tuck them in
i love this coat it is exactly what i was looking for it is unlined with cute fabric edging on the seams and a lightweight wool but it is roomy enough for layering and that is what i like about it also like the length as it can conceal a long tunic sweater without it hanging out the bottom it is very versatile in that it can be worn with something dressy or jeans and leggings also like that i can add any fun scarf to dress it up or down its a great contemporary shape i would say this c
do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub i think with this top the styling is key the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasnt a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editingi styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didnt seem to be static prone
love this shawlwrap was looking to purchase the white  warren cashmere poncho but available online only and then saw this in the store tried it on and fell in love love that its  cashmere  super soft and warm would recommend
this dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater
i saw this in stores and ran right up to it because of the gorgeous embroidery work and vivid colors  unfortunately those bright colors are totally washed out in the online model picsbarely recognizable the fabric itself is super soft and not at all stiff plus it has pockets i can see this looking great with leggings and boots but the sleeves flared a little too much which i think would add bulk under a cardigan so it might not carry as far into cooler months as i would like my usual s

i tried it one bcasue it is on sale and i love ittoo bad i dont need yet anothr black top fit is looseflowy but the ruffles add a littl cahrm to the shirt tried on regualr xs i could proably go to petites though but thankfully there is a button at the neck
i have been searching for grey jeans and havent found anything that i truly love i tried on both a  and  the  was too tight and i dont think they would have stretched out enough for me to be comfortable in the  was close but i was afraid they would stretch out too much they looked good from the front but did nothing for my cushion the color length and feel of the jeans was perfect in the end they went back and the hunt continues for grey jeans i would recommend trying these

i saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery  i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy unfortunately this dress is huge it is a rectangle with pockets i bought the xxsp my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with methis dress was beyond alterations too bad it was a great idea but no
i am very happy with this ponchosweater it is my first cashmere sweater and it feels so soft and luxurious true it does not have full length sleeves but if you adjust the sweater so that it comes down lower on your shoulders it will come well past your elbows covering most of your arms i feel very elegant wearing it looks great with skinny pants or leggings and boots would recommend

"the design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect however the fabric despite  spandex has absolutely no give from the knee down the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch while i was able to pull them on size  for   i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably with longer wear i think they would cut off the circulationplease post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer"
these are probably my  pair of pilcro legging jeans and though i love the color sort of a worn in soft black dark gray these particular pair fit a tiny bit more snug than any of my others it could be the fact that these are ankle length vs most others are long with the cords being extra long and cozy so i wonder if the fact that these are shorter they tend to sit on my legs a little differently it may also be just this pair was cut a tiny bit smaller i am toying with the idea of ask
i got this shirt in an xxsp and it has a great slim body the front ruffle isnt overpowering although i dont love the ruffles on the sleeves i think its just a little too much but they arent visible under a sweater or jacket the length is just right so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy the silk is just a touch sheer but not too seethrough its a good shirt
"this sweatshirt is a very nice staple piece i think it can be easily dressed up and down the quality is quite nice and should hold up over timethe sizing of this really depends on the desired fit i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts but honestly i tried the medium as well and it was much different just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired for reference"
i saw this t on sale and ordered it i had second thoughts thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have well i got it today and am thrilled the fabric is so soft a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good the fit is the fit we all want in a great t nice fit not too baggy not too tight and it is so flattering it doesnt show off my tummy as so many other ts do i can wear this with jeans or a skirt so glad i got it
i tried this on in the store and it was huge i couldnt try on a smaller size because they only had a  and  i tried on my usual size  i dont think the embroidery is as pretty in person either definitely not worth the price
this is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste it hit about two inches below my belly button it was a little snug around the belly area so thats why i feel it runs small for the brand usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top
best jeggings ever they look and fit like skinny jeans but feel like leggings soft but substantial fabric nice dark gray worn in color
"first of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways if you wear it so its long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa my only big complaint is that ive worn it twice and theres already a large hole in the arm seam poor construction which is disappointing hopefully mine was a oneoffid recommend it but definitely wait for a sale"
"i just got this tunic last night and was excited to try it on i could barely get it over my shoulders and once i did it was immediately apparent that it was very tight under the arms and in the shoulders i usually wear a  but listened to all the other reviewers and sized down to a  the  shoulder seams were significantly narrower than i would have expected i dont think even a  would have been large enough in the shouldersvery bummed but yet i wasnt drawn to the colors in pers"
i am all about beach cover ups i already have the leblon one from this season which i loooooove but i love this one tooand it is in my goto color which is fantastic i love beach cover ups i always imagine the sounds of the birds waves rolling in and a nice breeze allowing it to flow as i walk along side the beach my reality of course is chasing after screaming kids and walking along a mn pond not rolling waves but this dress would at least make me feel like i am in my own little wo
stunning bought it today and i love it it runs big im usually a xss and went with the xs and its perfect flowy and comfy im   great for summer and i think will transition great into fall with a cardigan
really like the quality color and overall design of these jeans they ran a little long on me but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties i didnt need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed so glad that was the case given the price tag on them i am   lbs and wear a size  which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed definitely recommend these jeans
i bought this tank to go with the navy wide legs pants shown in the picture  i bought this top in a  and could have gone a size down  im very small chested  i think that for someone with a larger chest it is probably more true to size  i wanted the extra length so im keeping the   im  ft  lbs and usually wear a medium or large  in retailer tops the layering of the top is very pretty as is the embroidery
this henley has a lot of very nice details lace embroidery the material is soft and a little bit sheer more so in the lacey sections it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltagebut there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only this irks me a bit because i would like to button the sh
love the unique stitching on the shirt and the dye job  i think it does run a little big  the arm holes are quite deep even in a medium but the fabric is thin so a tank underneath would probably work out well
i like this top it is a nice casual top i think it looks better on the model because it looks a bit dressy when i tried it on it looked good but not as dressy the embroidery on the side gives the top a nice look i also like the tiedye look the price is high i got it on sale price the fabric is a simple tshirt the embroidery makes it stand out i am keeping it
love i always used to wear skinny jeans until i discovered these highly recommend they elongate your legs and curve in just the right places super flattering plus they are extremely comfortable however im  ft  inches and i have to wear a good  inch heel with them
i love this dress i would have never picked it off the hanger in the store in fact i went right past it however when i was in the dressing room trying something else on i saw two girls wearing it and it was adorable i immediately tried it on and loved it i think it runs really big i am normally a size  build and i bought the xsmall i small also fit but was a bit too baggy most topsdresses at retailer also run big so it makes sense this does too but there is no way i am a true
got this today and highly recommend it it fits perfectly and is very flattering i can see wearing this all wear round perfect date shirt
i think this shawl is much more stunning on than on the hanger i think it will be a great piece to transition into fall wearing it over a black or white tee it can be dressed up or down especially for the sale price a great piece

this dress is absolutely gorgeous the colors are actually very bright it has a little embroidery and beading in the chest area the fabric is actually very soft and it comes with built in slip i found that it runs true to size i got a medium as i wanted it to be more roomy im planning to wear it with booties long boots or sandals in the spring i think it will make a great teacher dress
i purchased this online because i just loved the gorgeous designs and embroidery it has a unique cut to it as it has wrist holes but is otherwise open i have a difficult time keeping it from falling off of my shoulders when i wear it over bear skin i hope it will stay in place when i wear it over long sleeves or a sweater overall i am happy with it but i think it may run small as it hits the model at her wrists but hits me above my elbow i am not very tall or longlimned so it seems strang
this is a busy dress that makes me think bohoglam holly hobby i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me im going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more im recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style
i just bought this and really think it is a great dress it is conservative and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes yet i do not like to look frumpy this is cute and chic yet conservative also j got  because it is black friday thank you retailer

as other reviews noted this runs largehuge is more like it its great quality but im wondering now if the sm would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy which is why i ordered a ml im  and if i were any less i dont think this would work for me at all
i always have to try on tops of retailer i know this and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway i dont think ill do it again the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly ironically when i washed it according to directions it also shrunk quite a bit
this top is very strange i agree with the other reviewer in that i think its not cotton it clung and got bunched up around my chest like in a static cling way theres just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas its going back
i bought these leggings for yoga i love them the material is so soft and also seems sweat wicking which is a plus the back detail on the calf is a nice touch of flair compared to basic leggings the waistband is wide and did not fold over during practice for reference i am   lbs and i purchased a m fit was great i normally wear size  in pants would recommend
this is a beautiful top the fit is very flattering im tall with broad shoulders and the sleeves hit just above my elbow i wear it on the weekends and to workvery versatile i washed it in the washing machine and hung to dry its the same size and no fadingnot sure about the others below with shrinkage issues highly recommend it
i bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed im  and slim it was matronly i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt keep that in mind if you do buy pretty

i have been self conscious about a recent weight gain going from a size  to a size  but this dress makes me look  feel skinny again i know people have suggested that vertical stripes help if you want to elongate your figure it is true thanks to this dress i look like my old self and i am super comfortable wearing this all the time you can wear this dress from day to night you can dress this up or down it looks great with a jean jacket and hightops or highheeled booties with a n
i have worn this beautiful sweater with all kinds of outfits i love to dress it down with ripped skinnies booties  some long layered necklaces i did not have as big an aversion to the itch factor as the other reviewer but it is definitely not super soft or anything it fit a little larger than true to size in my opinion i shouldve ordered a small i think its a very unique winter staple that matches almost every single thing in my wardrobe its versatile snuggly  warm id recommend

i just got this at the black friday sale i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood  i usually wear brighter colors it feels wonderfulcozy and silky like expensive pjs looks very glamorous yet laid back i feel like i am in a  romantic film i got a ps and it fits flowy it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs love it it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline 
i just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look its a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type which is tall and thin i think this dress would not work on a more busty womans frame but it definitely works for me im  and  pounds and a small is plenty big i often take a medium i definitely recommend this dress

i bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever i let my sisters try it on too to see if they wanted it or liked it better but it was awful on them as well i ordered the xs in blue it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering i am  and  i love swing dressesi just dont think is cut well
i wasnt sure how clingy this dress might be or how it would look on my curvy body its actually really lovely it runs large but not overwhelming nice length above the knee in the front slightly longer in the back the colors are really beautiful i got the darker color will definitely wear this with a belt otherwise i think as other reviewers said it will be too maternitylooking i got this at a great sale price
"theres not much to add to what reviewers have said beautiful flowing lightweight fabric flattering cut gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer you wouldnt find it anywhere elseive had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment some of the embroidery is coming loose its gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t"
i needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers it is a loose flowy swing dress i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses but i do love a feminine loose casual dress from time to time too this totally fit the bill it is true to size fitted on the arms loose and swingy everywhere else i got the peach color and love it the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th
i wish this dress was more fitted the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture i bought this dress in an xs but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress sad to say that it is going back
another reviewer mentioned this was maternityish i am currently almost  months pregnant and i have to say this is a wonderful maternity dress even if thats not what it was made for when not pregnant i think this might have been a little overwhelming and i guess well see next year if thats the case for me  there is a lot of fabric here i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows the colors on the blu

i am an retailer employee i love this romper and suggested it to several of my regular ladies the day it arrived in our store they both loved the piece before they tried it onthe jumpsuit is so cute and has the special flair of a piece you would expect to find at retailer the piece is lined which is an added bonus but there is where the issue with the jumpsuit arrives the lining is to short makes it feel awkward i ordered the xxs petite and it fits perfect except the inside l

this jumper is gorgeous i usually dont instantly spend almost  on one piece without contemplating but as soon as i tried this on i fell in love i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller i am  for reference and even at  its barely short enough to not be too long on me so if you are an inch or two taller i would recommend the pe
i recently wore this to a beach wedding and it worked out great with a cute denim jacket the orange color is pretty and vibrant and it is comfortable to wear i like the length of it and it flows really well as you walk the cons are that it wrinkles really easily i used a steamer extensively when it arrived to steam out the wrinkles but it still had a wrinkled look to it because i think of how the seams are as i got back up from sitting down for  minutes the front and back were alr
the colors are beautiful on this shirt and it is true to size it is very comfortable but i wish the flowing part on top was pinned under arms or something it is attached at the top of the tank top but nowhere else so it just kind of lays over the tank with a poncho looki also think the top layer would look better if it was longer it hits at my natural waist and im petite i still plan on keeping it and think it will be cute enough with jeans just really wanted to love it

i just got these leggings yesterday and honestly theyre amazing they look just like the picture feel great on dont slip in the waist zero negatives i cant wait to wear these bad boys out
color not as vibrant as in the picture skirt is darted which is not clearly seen in the picture assumed would be cut on the bias which im more familiar with in slip dresses i didnt fill in the bust and the style is such that it isnt possible to compensate with helpful undergarments while not for me im still recommending it because it may fit others better reviewers are instructed to avoid writing about customer service but i feel compelled to note that the customer service i have
i was looking for a top to wear out that was chic but not too dressy this top fit the bill the sleeves and the embellishments give it a very feminine touch i paired it with skinny black ankle pants and black heels and received lots of compliments it is comfortable and easy to wear for a long night out it does run big so i recommend sizing down also the sides are slightly sheer but i wore a black tank underneath without a problem great top
now i ordered both striped versions and i dont know which to keep the material is a nice soft knit the neck line is almost boatneck with little buttons so cute colors are really nice too i tried it on with skinnies and trousersa nd ti looked great with both i went with the petite version for those shorter gals out there xxs petite fit me i havnet tried o the xs petite yet  and  lbs i think it would loke nice with a pencil skirt too if i only had one that went wit
loved the fabric of this dress and the slip that comes with it i wish the waist line fit a little better though i am  with an athletic build and it looked really boxy on me i was so disappointed thought i could synch it in to make it work but think this is a return
i bought this mainly because i have a similar one in the mustard colorway and i love how this flows the color is definitely one you dont see a lot of which is what makes it special i could see it running a tad large but i think its pretty true to size now im debating about buying it in blush
"love the colors in this autumn designed sweater that i just received but it has to be returned i disagree with one of the reviews that it is not as pictured as far as the green being off i think it is just as pictured i love the texture of the large pockets and belt with the suede feel i love the flap on the back what i dont like is how large it is i have never worn an xs from retailer and i should have listened to the advice from the previous reviews but i didnt i could send it back"

i bought this dress on super sale online after seeing it in the store the pattern is just so beautiful and unique i think it looks much pretty in person than online there isnt a lot of shape to the dress but i like the loose style and can see this being worn with bootsbooties it also looks nice with a belt my only complaint is i had to size down to a  usually an  in dresses and the liner slip was a little tight also would have loved to try this in petite the regular falls to just
beautiful cardigan but it does run large  im about   lbs normally a large in tops and the medium fits great its still a bit roomy but i think this cardigan is meant to be a tad roomy  i agree with another reviewer that its a bit itchy on bare skin but its wool so thats a given  overall a great cardigan for fall
love the fabric of this buttondown runs really large however am usually a small or xs  so bought a  its ok but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body   not in a good way i think it probably works well tied at the waist but alas  i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy returned reluctantly hope others will enjoy
im  and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering i saw it i the store on was drawn to it i love the shimmer but perhaps thats because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc the m fit great in both length pans width it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots i felt it made me look thin thankful i bought it on a discount day its a fabulous sweater
so cute a definite add for this summer sizing and pattern are both onpoint would be cute with so many bottoms
what a great sweater the pale pink is sweet but the grey was more my style im    and the xs is perfect i know everyone is saying this sweater runs large but i believe this style is meant to be a bit oversized so i would call it true to size with that in mind the arms are long the shape is boxy but not short and i love the way it hangs on my thin frame its super soft  cozy will easily be a goto sweater this fall

i wanted this top since the first time i saw it it fits perfectly in a small as i usually wear a small or medium it would probably fit better if you are smaller on top i am a  as it is not generously sized it flares at the bottom which looks quite flattering the lace on the sleeves really adds a lot of style i will wash it carefully as i am not sure how well the lace will hold up with washing this is a beautiful top and i am considering buying another in a different color i think
this dress was so cute and comfortable i said it runs big but i think that may also simply be the style of it i paired it with some cute boots and received many compliments love it
i love the pattern but the color was not great on my skin tone i tried on the regular size and it wasnt great teh cut could work but overall i didnt feel like it was enough for me to order the petite to see and i sometimes do in a tall darker toned person this would be gorgeous what i like the most is the color pattern in the print and shimmer
this is simply a fabulous dress i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small though there is nothing wrong with that i am not i am older and heavier and the dress fits very well im also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tentlike the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening it looks great with a jean jacket for example and booties and it also looks terrific with flats it d
i ordered this dress in navy for fall and it is now easily the most darling and figure flattering dress in my wardrobe i am  lbs and size  in jeans i usually wear a size small but ordered a medium based on reviews that said this dress runs small and i like that the medium is a little longer and slightly blousy making it more modest but the small would have worked just fine for a slightly more figureaccentuating look the fabric hangs beautifully and has a silky feel the navy flower
i bought this sweater in the black it is so flattering and feels great on the sleeves are a bit long but they are supposed to be the material is not overly thick yet it feels soft and well made while the lace sleeves are the star of this show the back is so flattering it has a perfect cut that i dont think comes through in the picture it fits true to size love this one
i bought this is in the gray color although imo it has more of a greenish hue i love it its a wide boxy fit like others have said and tends to fall off the shoulder i purchased it in the small my typical size and it definitely seems to run large it relaxes too as i wear it giving it an even roomier feel that said its very cozy  comfortable i wear a tank underneath works well for  and  weather
i am  and  extremely muscular i ordered a size large and it hangs very nicely over my curves the neckline looks pretty good with my broad shoulder and the dress comes about  inches above my knee i think people with curves would really like this dress but it does lack shape so beware if youre looking for something with some structure the blue is gorgeous and the fringe details are very cute this dress does seem to run a bit big
stunning sweater for cooler weather i think it runs a little small so returned first one and ordered one size up which fits perfect
i ordered the navy in an xl although am generally a medium or large in tops i sized up because it looked fitted and i think it was a good choice for me it fits just like the model but the back droops a bit and the neck is wider my bra is still covered in the back  it fits perfectly in the waist and the elastic allows for some adjustment in placement theres  layers of ruffles in the skirt portion im  and was concerned it would be too young looking but i love the look it hits about an
i wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness such as myself  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting for me
i already have some dresses similar to this but i couldnt help getting this one too i love the flowers bees and ladybugs on the print there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots i think i can wear this at work with the right cardiganjacket so ill get more use out of it its a lovely light floaty fabric thats nice for warmer weather
very high quality fabric and the fit is excellent the skirt is stylish yet simple and very easy to wear as i feel i would have no trouble paring it with several different tops it can easily be dressed up or down and is excellent for work i got this on sale and am so glad still it is one of the few items actually worth the initial high price tag great quality
these pants are so comfy im getting a second pair i ordered the olive color in a smallreg im thinking of ordering the xs next time since they do stretch out a great deal as the day goes on would definitely recommend these for sure hope this review is helpful as i struggled with ordering petite or not glad i didnt
these are nice comfortable summer pants that travel well the material has a nice feel to itlightweight but not too thin they are easy to wear with any summer top and look just dressy enough i like the elastic waist but the pants will stretch out a bit and run a little large
i bought this duster in the blue color and really like it i am  so love the longer length the large was too wide so got the medium the sleeves were a little snug on my upper arms but after wearing it for awhile they loosened up i think i will get the white too
i went with my usual size but it is too tight it fits but i would feel uncomfortable in it i ordered the pink one which looks nice in the picture but in person it looks cheap the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the  that beaded neckline added to the cheap look this one is not for me
"the lace inlet sleeves on this comfy top add unexpected detail that dresses it up you can wear this with jeans or skinny cords as well as a fitted skirt the material is comfy and the neck is not too tight nor too loosei usually wear a small and the small fit the best i tried the xs and medium and although they both fit the xs seemed a bit too short and the medium was too long in the arms"
this looked really pretty but i think i am just too short for it a little on the wider side would look good on someone taller
i went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress and im so glad i did the fit was perfect im always a little hesitant about long dresses since im  but the petite length was perfect the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable but i feel elegant in it i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month
this is a beautifully made sweater i bought this sweater in ivory yesterday i wore it today and received many compliments i think the sweater is adorable its soft and warm the neck is perfect i like that its not as restrictive as a turtleneck the long sleeves add character and help to make it interesting i highly recommend itim looking for a black one

i ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders however im finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me the quality is nice it is medium in weight it has a cottony feeling but it not super soft it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me i wanted to love it but i only just like it i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun loose look in a sweater
i ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me im usually fine with the petite sizing but this didnt work and im so bummed the dress is soft the blue color is gorgeous but it fits like a bag i wanted to love this but sadly will have to return i think someone with curves will love this dress it is really beautiful quality just does not fit a petite frame
i had purchased the black color of this sweater at full price and loved it so much that when i saw the burgundy color go on sale i knew i had to have it this sweater is very comfortable and elevates any look with its lace down the sleeve mock neck collar and slightly flared silhouette its so fun to find different shirts to wear underneath to get a whole new look highly recommend would have gotten all colors
love this sweater it fits true to size fun and different purchased  off but i dont think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget
ive been buying from retailer for the last  years and this is the first time ive ever posted a bad review first of all the fabric is scratchy thin and looks very cheap second of all there is no v back its more of a slight scoop and lastly im  so i ordered the petite small and its still comes  inches below my knee i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup
"beautiful unique design its very flattering the way the fabric hangsi usually wear a  but because the lining is much smaller than the dress which many linings are its a pet peeve of mine i sized up to a  and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust otherwise in the  my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly that said im very sensitive to that kind of thingother reviewers have noted that the emb"
i had my eye on this for a while and finally picked it up on sale i got the darker blue in xs great piece fits well very cozy but the cuffs add such cute detail
i love these jeans but be advised that they run a little small in the waist they work for me but i think theyd work best on those with an hourglass shape im  and about  lbs with a small waist and i wear a  in these but i have hips  the  fits perfectly since it has a small waist but accommodates my hips i love these jeans great fit good fabric great price
this coat is simply beautiful i love the slits on the sides it makes it unique and sexy i would suggest that you go up a size so the silhouette is not disturbed by any pulling or tugging im so happy with my purchase
i liked the simple styling of these jeans when i saw them in the store the price is right considering what some jeans cost today unfortunately these are made in china that bummed me out they run a tad bit small but in the end i think they are more true to size because they give especially in the waist the higher waist is a nice change its nice to be able to skip a belt the denim is a bit rough after air drying so i hope it softens up
i think its prettier in person the color is a little brighter in reality and the beading on the lower half is in  colors green and gray which isnt apparent in the photo although i would consider it true to size its a full looking top im  and both the sleeves and the length are not as long on me as they are on the model its a bit sheer but i personally found it to be fine with a nude bra cute vintage look
i wanted to love this jumpsuit it looks adorable in the product photo i am  about  and thus was overwhelming on me i tried everything pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line wearing a variety of heel heightsi couldnt seem to make it work there was just so much fabric on me it felt like i was wearing pajamas and not in a cute wear your pajamas out way i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut on me this jumpsuit was just
i love pilcro legging jeans and cords and this pair was no exception i didnt see much difference in the fit and i bought my usual  the stretch definitely creates a lot of give but i dont mind id be hesitant to size down in the waistband but if you usually have room and prefer a more snug fit then go ahead washed well the first time
i just got this in the mail today its really cute when i put it on but its definitely meant to be worn slightly off the shoulders like the model is showing i was hoping i could wear it both ways but then the vneck becomes way too low i would recommend sizing down unless youre bigger busted however the torso is cut very true to size which might make it hard for some to size down without it becoming too small a larger bust might help to keep this from falling off the shoulders im not
i absolutely love this cardigan it is so soft and goes with anything it can be dressed up or down it is definitely my new go to for airplane travels highly recommend
this wash fits differently than other pilcro jean leggings the rise is higher and the fit is largerbulkier through the waist and hips i love pilcro legging jeans so the fit difference is kind of disappointing i recommend trying this wash on first to see if you need a smaller size i got the same size i always get in this style and this wash is definitely not as flattering as other pairs i own
this dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess lol im normally a  or ml and took a  i think the  would have worked too everything from the colors fit and flow of the dress is wonderful i didnt have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned

i dont normally like laceup details but for some reason i dont mind it on this top its a bit shorter than it looks on the model and im not especially tall the fabric is nice  not too heavy not too lightweight great for fall
i went to the store to try on a jumpsuit and ended up with these instead while the jumpsuit was really cute i thought these would be more versatile as far as i can tell they are the same style as the pradollano tapered loungers by hei hei these were so cute and comfy i bought both they can easily be dressed up with a jacket and heels or worn casually with a tee and sandals i think these are much cuter in person than online there is a little red design in the pants which is hard to see in
"definitely order down a size i am almost always an xl big chest broad shoulders but the l in this fits me perfectly well worth the sale price a fun boho transition pieceit is a reverse print so the inside is brighter than the outside but i like the blurred paisley printits subtlethe back detail is great and very flatteringit is quite full and flowy but in a flattering way i think just restrained enough"
this top is very flattering on my torso my problem area the sleeves are adorable and i love the navy with purple tints and the touches of gray i would say this product could work on most body types its very comfortable and i could wear it for a long time i would suggest considering a smaller size than ones normal size but i would look into both sizes and see which one you prefer i ended up getting my regular size because i just liked the way it looked better
i ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back i went with a medium but that ended up running too big i typically wear between a  and a   small and medium so im always on the fence about which size to get i often order both online and return the one that doesnt fit as well so i wish i had this time too the detail on the front is super cute and i didnt even mind the plainer back but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li
i wanted to like this top so badly because it has so many interesting pieces to the blouse ultimately i didnt keep this because of the bell sleeves and the pattern going across the body just wasnt flattering on my full figure i went down a size to help reduce the amount of fabric draping in the back but it didnt make up for the pattern that i just didnt like if you are interested in this blouse i recommend it because it might work out for someone with a different figure than mine
i was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband but i love them they feel wonderful yet they are so light perfect for warm weather the print takes them from day to night
this sweater i bought to go with a navy dress it is not ivory it is sortof a blush color not at all what i had in mind the sweater itself is pretty the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it definite return 
this tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit the material is thin and it certainly doesnt feel like it is worth the price tag i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about

i wore this to my retirement party i wanted something special for a once in a lifetime event i wanted something that was dressy while also being unique so i wouldnt look like everyone else almost without exception from my boyfriend to everyone i talked with mentioned my dress the design is so unique making me feel even more special on my special day its beautiful yet comfortable the stretchy sides made it feel snug without pinching or discomfort really a fun dress to wear im sure

im a big fan of the idea of jumpsuits and rompers but so often they go wrong this one was an unexpected surprise im  size  and the medium fit well and was actually super flattering the waist is cinched just so that its very slimming the roll tab cuff is a cute touch and is probably  higher on me than the model but adorable none the less great quality too love
i know rompers typically  the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper etc and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i  think it is worth the price
absolutely love this dress i ended up wearing it backwards to work for a more modest neckline but flipped it around for an evening night out cant recommend it enough  two of my colleagues ordered it that day
the material of this dress is really thick and substantial very soft and it has good movement the cut was not quire right for my body unfortunately but on the right person this would be very nice i think a lot of different body types would look great in this dress depending on where the waist hits etc
the material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky i think this dress is truetosize or maybe runs a little bit big but only by a little bit i bought a medium and am a size  in tops and  in pants the dress hugs nicely on the upper body arms chest ribs and flares just a little bit on the hipstummybutt area it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha
i love the overall look and feel of the dress my only complaint is that it was shorter and lower cut in person than it looked on the model and im not tall i ordered a small and im   lbs bottom heavy the skirt is perfectly flowy and hides my problem areas really well however i will need to wear a camisole with it to hide cleavage that will show otherwise
cute easy to wear dress personally i think it looks better with a belt or something to accentuate the waist otherwise its a lot of fabric in the middle i didnt think the top was too low as others have mentioned though it is possible to wear backwards with a v neck front if that bothered you nice length long enough for work

i discovered seea bathing suits last year and fell in love i currently own two  the hermosa surf suit and the  seea zuma for reference i am   pounds   waist dress size  pants  jeans  if you have questions about sizing there is a great reference on seeas website on how to size if you are taller than the reference sizing they provide but still the same measurements as another size mentioned they suggest sizing up as the suits are typically made for surfingpadd
this is such a cute dress the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight i ordered the blackbeige print and the fabric is beautiful it really drapes and hangs nicely because there is so much fabric i dont think this dress needs a lining it seems to wash and hang dry well im  about  lbs i like the way the medium fit the length was slightly above the knee which was ok with me im nearly  all in all i can see mys

great dress the seaming helps add shape to the dress it is flattering and super comfortable this dress is so easy to wear im sure i will reach for it again and again
i am going to keep it i think it will be a great throw on and go piece you can wear with many different types of shoesandal the detail on top is excellent and it is a flattering cut two complaints runs a little big on bottom a little genie lookinglike there is too much fabric above the elastic around your upper ankles but the bigger issue is that there is no zipper or elastic on top so slipping the top over your shoulders is super tight to the point i thought i was going to rip it
i love love this top it is a very pretty casual top it looks very nice on and is more like a tunic perfect with jeans very casual but the embroidery ruffle sleeves and buttons at the top add a nice touch i have the red i am considering buying this in blue as well i have so many newly purchased blue tops
i love this sweater dress i got the ivory color in a size small im a size    i feel in love with it while shopping with a friend who kind of rolled her eyes at it i went back later because i knew i loved it since the ones on the sale rack were covered with dust and dirt at the hem i ordered it on line in m  small and the small fit better it is so soft and the color is great
a good sweater but something about it was just not right for me just didnt feel like i would wear it
the colors and design are stunning in person it is onesize and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing and not fitted i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings i love the idea of layering this over shorts i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit coverup the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it also really pops over simple black leggings and black top its light an
beautiful material and washable im vertically challenged and the slits are a tad bit high even for me but still tasteful i would suggest sizing down as im normally a medium in retailer but due to the nature of the material i opted to size down and im so glad i did no arm hole struggles with my particular dress either overall just a really cute versatile cozy and functional option that will certainly get plenty of exposure for many winters to come
first off let me say that i am  and dont often go for print jeans these days however these are just so stinking fun and flattering that i couldnt say no these look great cuffed for warmer temps and rolled to full length will be fun to wear with fall sweaters if you are looking for something fun and flattering these are the ticket i bought the grey version and feel that they will work with many pieces that i already have
i tried this on in the store all of the dresses in the store were misshapen and pulled long in the armholes and i love all of my local retailer stores i dont think these should be hung on a hanger the knit is too heavy for hanging the hem on the dress i tried in the store was dirty from dragging on the floor i went home and ordered it online with the  dress discount and free shipping the dress i received was clean unstretched in the armholes and not oddly short like some review
i bought this online in my usual size petite xxs for instore pickup when i tried it on the kindest word to describe it would be voluminousit was at least  sizes too big on me i looked like i had taken grandmas tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse the blouse comes with an attached cami which was also way too big for me the color is not white as described but rather an ivorycream colordefinitely not the best shade for my light olive skin i do think that it looks lovel
i wanted to love this dress however it has no shape to it it is also somewhat see through so something needs to be worn under it i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned im extremely disappointed i do not recommend

i did not notice this dress on the website it was not until i saw it in store was an online purchase  returned  i was immediately in love i love the color texture and rosettes i feel like a million bucks wearing it and have received so many compliments on it before buying it i actually ran home to gather a previous purchase and return it so i could buy this dress and not feel guilty i am usually a  or  and the  fits perfect through and through so happy with this lovely dress

i bought this kimono only a couple weeks agoand i think ive worn it six times already this kimono is stunning light airy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous the print is unique and bold ive worn this over a black dresswith leggings and a white tankwith denim and every color top the options are endless with this beauty the only downside is the kimono is so airy and oversized that the armholes easily get hooked on things i ripped it once but thankfully it was right down the s
i love this coat i would definitely recommend it i normally wear a size  or a medium i bought my normal size and had to return it for a small customer service was great and made for an easy online exchange
the lighter tinted denim is a faded bluegrey that will go perfectly with most of my wardrobe and is more summery than the usual dark denim i wear these feel like stretchy jeans to me not leggings i wear size  in most jeans and these fit tts really nice
this coat is very nice its soft and the colors are great the only reason i gave it a  stars and not  is that it runs huge i normally wear a size small to medium in tops and i like a bit of moving room in my coats so i ordered a medium when i put it on i just started laughing it was so huge i wanted to exchange it for an xs to see if that would have been small enough but it has already sold out in that size i think this could be a big win for larger sizes but unfortunately for me it did
it is gorgeous and yes the side slits are very high but i am still keeping and rocking it i am a size  and got the large probably could have got the medium but after a few washings i think the larger size will be ok side slits high but if the weather is good and you have self tanner on legs it looks great with shortie boots i have gotten many cmpliments on it just hope it still keeps its shape after a long day of wear very pretty in cream though i do recommend it i am

i love the way the mock neck style looks but the shirt is cut very small i realize its supposed to stretch but its still very very tight on particularly in the shoulder area if you like the style id recommend sizing up
"i am on the fence with this onethe black lace on the bottom is beautiful and pairs so well with my black velvet gladiator sandals but it came very wrinkled and the fabric almost feels more like a cheap cotton i am always in between a sm and med so tried the small the shoulders do want to slide up a bit arms need to be downit is very voluminousand falls below my bottom would make a pretty maternity top the idea of it overall is pretty but not sure i want all the volu"
i just go these socks in one of my beauty boxes there is nothing like a new pair of socks they feel amazing no matter what you do these are ultra soft and inline with other slipper socks i have tried with the grippies on the bottom i like the color black style actually i like all the new styles at retailer right now and i didnt think i would like the higher tabs in the back but it turns out i love them to make sure the sock is covering my whole ankle when i put my shoes on the

love these pants super comfy and casual i found they run true to size and are just lose enough to feel casual not sloppy my only complaint the cuffs of the jeans were thoroughly covered in some kind of animal hair very disgusting but love the jeans
beautiful beautiful beautiful goes great with pilcro stet big rise grey jeans and deep green hei jeans i wear this on shoulders vs off so lovely  beautiful rich earth tone colors and live the lace bottom can dress up with black skirt or black skinnies and heels highly recommend
the quality and color is great on this top  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true offthe shoulder look  and to wear it as a cowl neck or actually looks like a boat neck just makes it too ordinary since i love the off the shoulder look  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering so i think my size was right  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other
i bought these to have a pair between standard fair and sexy but these are so comfortable and gorgeous i would wear them everyday it doesnt even feel like i am wearing anything love these
this was my favorite item in the august catalog  i knew i had to have it my store had not received it yet so i ordered online after reading the other reviews i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit however this top hangs like a tent also the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar

i discovered this top folded on a shelf and loved the material and this brand so i decided to try it on even though its super hot right now in ar im so glad i did and ended up finding the other color and buying both i am    and long waisted it is difficult to tell in the pictures how this top fits around the waist it is snug fitting but the material is thicker so i feel like its very flattering i tried it on as a boat neck look then saw online it was off the shoulder a
"well another major score with pilcrothese pants in general are my goto pantsso i had high expectations when i bought themi have about every color in the hyphen cutand always hope they make more pairsand what do you know theyve meteven exceeded these expectationslove the fittrue to sizeeven though i will order another smaller size when i get smaller these are good enough to have that big pair and that oh i feel svelte pair the denim has just enough stretch a"
being six feet tall im always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women and im glad i did on this one with the off the shoulder look you can sometimes gain extra length and its true in this case i stayed tts because of length issues and while it is billowy its not horribly so i would think however if youre between sizes or not worried about height id go with the smaller option adorable comfy casual while being dressy enough for a night out
"im   and ordered a large it fit but the arms were awkwardly short the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right which would be okay however the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isnt even finished with any stitching its just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isnt sewnit would unravel with washing its soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on supersale and dont mind it com"
these jeans are excellent ive been looking for a boyfriend jean that has plenty of room without just looking too big and these are it theres lots of give in the material but they still conform to your shape i highly recommend
this top is very gorgeous and chic it is very tight at the bottom but i feel like it will stretch a little over time it is also very long which i love because it can be rouched up to a great length if you are curvy both colors are great i bought both and love both the sizing was correct if you want it to fit like it does on the model shot if you want it a little more fitted size down but it may be very tight on the bottom all in all i love them and they are definitely a great find fo
as soon as my eyes touched these pants i knew my body had to not only doo they look great they feel great the material is very soft with just enough stretch theyve quickly become my favorites i loved the first pair so much i immediately bought the other color
this is a lovely sweater that doesnt look much on me the way it does on the model in the picture i actually like it better on me its got a good scoop neck and it gives me a shape i tried it on in a small and im on the fence about whether to buy it or not i dont really need it but with the discount codes retailer is offering these days i feel like i should buy it anyway
this sweater looks heavy online bit is a very thin sweater it runs tts however if you like the short length then id size down im    and the xs was perfect the sweater didnt feel too scratchy but its not a soft sweater very feminine
this sweater fits differently than it looks on the model in the photo it is more fitted less bell sleeve and the neck is less boatneck on me i am often between sizes at retailer but in this one i got the larger size and it fits well i love this sweater i just wanted to mention that i think it fits differently than what it looks like in the pic
this is a perfect late summer into fall top you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeansbooties for the fall its slightly on the roomy side i am usually a medium and i had room but i think thats just the structure of the shirt off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place
im curvy on the bottom and i think this is quite flattering for curves id definitely advise sizing up on this one because its flared i can wear it higher up on my waist but thats not ideal and i think a bigger size will fit better its a very lightweight fabric and does wrinkle easily the color i got was a faded denim blue this is a lot lighter than what id call dark denim

this may be the most beautiful top ive ever purchased from retailer  gorgeous classy comfortable and oneofakind  i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it  runs large buy a smaller size than you usually wear  you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top  i wear it on the shoulders a perfect 
i saw this on a girl at the winery where i work and i thought to myself  i have to have that top it is perfect for the fall season the patternprint is very intricate and lovely i think it fits true to size  the petite xxs is just right the sleeves do not come to the wrist but the photo here depicts that already the elastic in the arms feel a little tight but that would be my own negative comment the fabric is beautiful and flows just right  it does not feel to big to me at all im s

i love the look of this dress but it runs very large i am   i ordered the extra small on sale  got a killer deal on it i intended to use it as a beach cover up since its sheer but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu even for the price  for the beach i am going to return it im sad because it is a beautiful coverup and for what it is i think the quality is good
i i hesitate to say that i dont recommend this dressit really is so prettybut a different fabric might have worked better more importantlythe cut is not rightfor me anyway the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower halfway too much fabric at the bottomlooks like a triangle  if they done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection
i so wanted this top in red and tried on the  but it was a little biglong on my  frame  lbs  i tried ordering  but it was sold out te only one available was the honey color so i decided to try it even though i am very pale well i actually do like it it isnt as popping as the red but it is super flattering and the color is actually classy so i feel like i could wear this with a dressier outfit not just casual i love the feel the fabric is airy great

"loved this dress it does run a little long even with  high heels i   and probably would have beenbetter with a petite size often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit not sure if i will hem it the print is pretty however busy i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic i added an black belt w"
the fabric has a smooth feel and the shape is perfect over skinny jeans i like the yoked v neckline a different take on the usual buttons of a popover i wear a white cami under it from retailer to bring up the depth just a little great with blue jeans white jeans and shorts i bought this shirt in red size  im   lbs
this is the perfect summer top lightweight and breezy looks great either tucked in to jeans or shorts or worn loose loved the blue one so i came back to get the red one i would recommend buying one size smaller than usual
i had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body i love the bottom of it it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back add an ada wrap belt and perfection
i bought the xs and the fit was good ill probably add a snap at the bust area because the slip underneath does show like a camisole which is fine but i prefer it closed also ill add a belt to cinch my waist booties and maybe a hat

i love this dress it is so comfortable the material feels nice and the print is beautiful the only reason i didnt give this a  overall rating is because this fits a little big i bought a petite medium and the elastic around the top is not as tight as id like it still fits and stays on but it would feel a little better if it was a little more snug at the top i love this dress because it is casual enough to walk around in but still feels somewhat dressy i will probably take this dress wi
i tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical i love this dress
this top is cute i purchased a  instead of my usual size  and it fits well i only recommend buying this top on sale it is not good quality there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through it is totally nuts that it costs 
the model looks awesome in this cute top but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short for reference im   lbs and  the front is nonstretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric yet the back is stretchy in theory its pretty but in reality it doesnt work  at least for me i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest
this is a great long sleeve casual shirt for spring  soft and airy pairs well with jeans i found that it fit me just right im not very tall but my shoulders are a little broad for my height which typically puts me in the smallmedium range so i got size  regular this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel my only problem is there aren
this dress is very flattering comfortable and made me feel pretty
i bought this sweater because i love twinkles knitting patterns and yarns this sweater doesnt disappoint i love all of the great details like the detachable collar the double buttons along the front and the back panel is in a seed stitch which differs from the front and sleeve stitch its super warm and cozy but its also very heavy depending on the temp outside i can wear this as a coat but i think the sweater will stretch over time because its so heavy
"the only reason i gave this top a  star is that it didnt have enough room around the bust area im a d cup and the front didnt button properly but for the price i paid  off sale price i have no coplaintsi would recommend"
a great long line bra beautiful and well made however its tough to get the fit perfectly right i usually wear a  b or  a and am  the small was the best fit as the  xs was a very small  i could almost say it more of a  if thats even a size it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours otherwise i recommend it
i must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color the color is to me like a lavender mauvish color but the description is actually natural  i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender  regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe i found the size to be true
the online pictures do not do this dress justice the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think oh my gosh thats the one but if you try it on you will have this moment it is comfortable flattering and slimminga prefect everyday dress

i feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday as they always seem to be out of stock now i know why these are soft comfortable and slimming theyre somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spansthey dont fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being paininducing
i tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look it looks way better in person than in the pictures the picture really doesnt do it justice i consider myself a slight hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peepholekeyhole in the front you can hardly see on the model photo is visible im so happy with this dress i feel like i could wear it at workchu
love this dress very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy  i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it
love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on especially over dresses but also anything it drapes beautifully and i love the button closure detail it is definitely a thin soft lightweight knit but i think that makes it practical for yearround use much like other items by bordeaux
i love this jacket so much i bought two it goes with almost everything and is a nice weight for almost any weather i recommend you grab it while its on sale
i tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun and who donset want a pair of comfycute pants but they looked awful on my muscular thighs i dont think the cut will be falttering on  of the population also not as comfortable as they looked the crotch seemed a little low on me though the pants were in the correct size
this is a very cute dress that i did not keep mainly because i did not like the neckline on me if it had been different i probably would have kept it i liked the fabric the top is a little thin but i did not think it was sheer the bottom part is sheer but there is a lining it drapes beautifully it is a little like a maternity dress but not enough to dissuade me
i purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve should have been a winwin the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult i had to add a slip that helped and figured that since im losing weight it would look better when im down a few more pounds that being said i didnt find it to be figure flattering i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to where i lo
"i worry when i have an elastic waist or something that resembles this but the dress hangs like a dreamno puffing out no gathers that you can seeit is not sheath but not a line either kind of in between hits several inches above my knees but perfect with some black tights for winter i saw the note about grey have to try it on agin in daylight but i would say think black on the top light camel color on the bottomi am  typically wear a size  and it was true to size for methe"
